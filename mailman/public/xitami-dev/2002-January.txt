Subject: [Xitami-Dev] C++/C linkage
Message-ID: <01f101c1982a$aa9e3d30$ee02a8c0@development.europeonline.net>

Hi,

I encountered a couple of problems when writing my own windows front end to
Xitami. I was using ATL - therefore C++ - for the object and when linking in
the sfl and smt libraries I had to change the header files sfl.h smtlib.h
and smthhtp.h to add the extern "C" to the declaration of the global
variables.

I also got a warning when compiling about a redefinition of FD_SETSIZE in
sfl.h (also declared in winsock.h - included earlier in atlbase.h) so I
added a

#  ifdef FD_SETSIZE
#   undef FD_SETSIZE
#  endif

 on line 258 in sfl.h

Should these changes be included in the source?

I wanted to write a spam filter using SFL/SMT, so that I could get the same

Before I go reinventing the wheel has any one here done any thing with POP3 &

Yes, we have a POP3 client written with SMT/SFL.  Let me just check 
that it's actually in the public CVS... okay, it's not, so we'll put 
it there and you can access it later from:

Folks,

Just FYI, there are now two new agents in the SMT library: smtpop3 
and smtsmtp, plus two matching test programs.  These agents provide 
multithread POP3 and SMTP access.  All comments welcome!

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] How do I build SMT?
Message-ID: <200201132041250.SM00388@there>

I've got SFL to build and test just fine from CVS.

I've got SMT from CVS but it seems like there is some thing missing, or I'm 
missing a step in the build process.

I've used otto to produce 'build'.

When I run build it says:

Checking for required files...
smtlog.d missing - aborting

I tried running make and it says:

c -q -c smtlog.c
In file included from smtlog.c:18:
smtdefn.h:23:80: smtmsg.h: No such file or directory
smtlog.c:48:80: smtlog.d: No such file or directory
smtlog.c:77:80: smtlog.i: No such file or directory
make: *** [smtlog.o] Error 1

There is no smtmsg.h in cvs ( http://cvs.imatix.com./cgi-bin/viewcvs/smt/ ), 
is there some thing I need to do to generate it?

I'm sure I've missed a step, but don't know where...

You'll need to run libero to generate all the dialogs.  (The single on
in SFL is pre-generated, after much internal discussion, because "it
doesn't change much".)

You'll also need to generate the SMT message include files, using GSL.
GSL2 can be used, I think.  GSL3 is in CVS as "gsl", but you need to
build SMT before you can build GSL3...

Welcome to the nightmare. You need to use Libero to build some of the 
files with a '.d' extension.

It's traditional to unsubscribe the address you don't want subscribed, and
then subscribe the one that you do want subscribed.  It's also traditional
to address such questions to the mailing list manager off-list.

And it's often helpful to provide some indication of what address it was
that you want unsubscribed, as well as what one you want subscribed.

Wearing my "mind reader" hat, I've unsubscribed judd@alphalink.com.au
and subscribed judd@ob-wan.com.  Hopefully this was the intended result.

Ok thanks.  Where did I miss reading this step in the documentation?

I am a bit perplexed as to why SFL & SMT in the Xitami package build them 
self, but the ones in CVS do not.

In the "Xitami build package"?  The ones from http://www.xitami.com/?

They're about 12-18 months older, and include all the various things
pregenerated, for easy of compile-and-go.  The CVS archive is our current
development tree, and one of the reasons that there's been no new releases
is that the build environment "needs work".

As for documentation, that's another thing that "needs work".  :-)

Feel free to use the SFL/SMT from the Xitami package if they're easier
for you to build and they hvae the functionality you want.

We've done this before... long time back we wrote a session 
management layer for Xitami.  It was part of our WTP protocol 
handler, a kind of large-scale LRWP manager that we built for our 
Studio toolkit.

WTP is a bit like LRWP but more complex.  We wrote our Studio 
application programs using Libero and the same form i/o system that 
comes with Xitami's administration SDK.  Studio has been static for a 
while and I've now put it into our public CVS archive.

This should be available from:

    http://cvs.imatix.com./cgi-bin/viewcvs/

when the site has been mirrored, which will happen some time today.

Check the OpenKernel Studio directory.  I can't guarantee that Studio 
will make sense or even build.  You will have to be ready to build 
your own version of Xitami (it uses a WSX plugin).

Hmmm. Studio seems to be cross-linked somewhere. I ended up with a copy
under the directory xitami/studio here. Nice to see it out in the open
anyhow; if you hear "aaa-a-argh" noises from down here you'll know I'm
making progress.

How are they different from the ones in the otto directory?  

FWIW, this has always been the case with the CVS archive: the "c" script
"belongs" to otto, and hence they are in that directory, rather than
duplicated in difficult-to-maintain positions throughout the archive.

Ok, I've spent the last half hour trying to build the version of GSL that I 
downloaded in the zip file, so I could build SMT, so I could build GSL3, so I 
could build...

All I get out of it is "bad interperter, no such file or directory" when I 
try to run 'c' or the makefile.  

sh-2.05 is my /bin/sh so I don't understand what it is complaning about.

I'm running Mandrake8.1.  Can some one point me in useful direction please?

Chances are fairly high that there is something wrong with the #! line
in the c script.  If there's nothing "visibly" wrong with it, and you
downloaded the zip file and didn't unzip it with the ascii file handling
(-a), chances are strong that there's stray carriage returns in the file.
So that it's looking for the interpreter /bin/sh\015 which doesn't exist.

Either open it in an editor and replace all the carriage returns with
nothing, or unzip it again with the "-a" flag, so that ascii files are
translated to the correct line terminators.

Looks like whatever version of GSL you're building is incompatible with
whatever version of SFL you're using.  IIRC xml_put_attr_ic had an extra
parameter added a while ago in SFL which caused this problem (and, yes,
there was some internal, umm, discussion about doing this).

So you'll probably want to build GSL2 from the website with the SFL from
the website.

Finally, yes, making this all easier to build is on our list of things
to do -- pretty high on our list these days :-)

Don't give up. :)  The reaction of Unix shells to scripts that have 
been DOS-ified is always cryptic.

To follow on Ewen's remarks, we are working towards a single 
OpenKernel distribution that includes all our open source tools in 
one nice package.  Estimate about 1-2 months before this is finished 
and stable.

SFL is from CVS, which built with little problem.  GSL is from the zip file 
from the web site because you had said that the version in CVS needed SMT 
first, but to build SMT I needed GSL...

I'll try building GSL, if it is not already there, with the stuff from Tami 
since it built fine, but ultimately I need the SMT form CVS because it had 
the pop3 stuff that I'm trying to use.

Thank you.  Take a look at the cons 'make' replacement project, maybe that 
would help.  http://www.gnu.org/directory/cons.html

Nope, you simply can't get there from here it seems.

SMT in CVS needs GSL from CVS, as was stated.

Can't build GSL from CVS because there is no build instructions of any kind, 
and I don't fell like creating them.  Also the gsl files won't build with the 
old version of gsl from Xitami, so even if there was build instructions, I 
still don't think I could build it.  To many circular build problems.

I guess I'll just wait...

Please test on a clean machine starting where you have no tools but the 
standard GNU tool chain, like I'm trying to start with...

Patrick,

I almost got it to compile with mingw32 about 18 months ago (xitami
2.5b4), but GCC has changed a lot since then in some very incompatible
ways. You would probably have more luck with it than, say, cygwin
though.

For certain results, get a copy of msvc from somewhere.

I think (and I did sometime) you can build the "original, current" GSL2
downloaded from the www.imatix.com and then the GSL link with the SFL and
SMT which is both there or in the Xitami but not with those in the CVS. I
think there are the "too new" SFL and SMT in the CVS which reqire GSL2 and
are required for GSL3. :))

Hope this helps!

Message-ID: <20020121100025.B349@buci>

Hi All,

I'm relativelty new to the developer list and I know a newcomer speak
easily.. but an idea even I think you already considered it.

What about to implement Libero (and maybe GSL) by flex and bison and of
course still using SFL? I think it can help to evolve the syntax and add
features. At least, sometimes I'm thinking about extending and embedding
Libero for run-time scripting. Bison also generates FSM but the aproach is
from the syntax which enables to modify it more easily than coming from an
automaton and trying to describe a language. IMO, bison is better for
languages while Libero/SMT, the direct FSM approach is great for logic and
programming, for algorithms.

Regards,
Laszlo

It's a good idea, and indeed I generally prefer Flex to Libero for 
designing parsers.  However... I once wrote a full COBOL lexical 
analyser in Lex, hit several hard limitations and ended-up using a 
small tool I'd written, called Libero.  That led me to finishing 
Libero and releasing it as free software.

Back to 2002.  We're rewriting Libero using GSL, so the tool will 
disappear as such, and become a GSL package.  The scanner/parser in 
GSLgen 3.x is probably too bizarre to be written using Flex/Bison, 
since it runs through SMT to allow multithreaded execution.  We did 
this to allow GSL programming in Xitami and similar contexts.

So I don't think it's interesting to consider Flex/Bison for GSL.

We have -- as you see -- been working on SMT despite the apparent 
silence over the last year or two.  smtsock and smttime no longer 
exist.  Their functions are now carried out inside the kernel itself. 
 This change allowed us to improve signal handling and certain stress 
conditions.  There have been many other small changes but overall the 
architecture is still the same.

However, you'll need to modify your code for talking to smtsock and 
smttime.  I'm not sure why sendfmt disappeared but there is probably 
a good reason for it.  In any case the CVS version is stable.  

I'll get someone to post a summary of the changes and how to convert 
your SMT agents.

Basically, I suggest Bison which is a 'yacc' by GNU (AFAIK). So, it is a
compiler compiler. Flex is only a parser generator, no more!

Flex really supports states to enable very complicated context dependent
tokenization but this is usually not required and the syntax should be
realized in the Bison part.

Before I found Libero (and it was a love for the first sight) I had first
met the FSM design in real-life when one of my collegues who had worked on
cdrom controller hardwares ten years ago had used the FSM approach to
build data stream processor programs using a switch-case representation by
hand. So, I'd hunt for some tool to help the design-to-representation.
First, I'd wanted to use Bison and so grammars to build the FSM (bison
also generates state transition matrix in source format) but it had been
very very hard to construct a language from a flowchart. (I'd thought that
since the data stream can be processed it is a kind of protocol and
protocols are usually spoken :)

Even the FSM is a fine representation for both grammars and logic the
approach is very different I think. You mention that "Libero is not for
everything" in the doc. I think program logic usually use comparisions
(if/switch), iterations (loops) and exception handling while grammars use
substitution, recursion and pattern matching. We know that a recursion can
be transformed into iteration and so on, but I think a compiler can be
more efficient and extendable using grammar techniques while a program
logic can profit from flowchart-like clear transition description
technique.

I feel the difference is something like between C/C++/Java/whatever and
LISP/Scheme. While the previous is for programming logic the latter is for
pattern finding, decision trees, AI. Both can be used for other targets
but it'd be a pain! Just think about general, day-by-day coding in LISP!
OK, maybe thit was too hard, but feel the difference. That's why I think
Bison would be better for compiler issues like Libero and GSL. Libero will
still remain genious for logic!


Sorry being so long or talking about well-known issues.

Laszlo

For me, it was very nice and consistent reaching the Kernel services very
same as all other components (agents). Anyway, SMT is a chained
multi-threading kernel you mention in the doc. Partially, that's why I
have no problem living with the Kernel on the same "level", I was
cooperative ;)
