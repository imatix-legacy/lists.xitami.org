Subject: [Xitami] Avoiding Web Crawlers(?)
Message-ID: <030220041700.23164.7ff3@att.net>

Hello,

Xitami is set up on a LAN to test WEB Page Creation. All is working great on the LAN and the WEB Pages set up in each PCs hosts file displays as expectd.

The router was then set to pass incomming messages to the IP and the Port where Xitami is installed. This works great from PCs outside this LAN to access these test WEB Pages given the correct http:// string to key-in at those PCs browsers.

However, there is a concern related to these test WEB Pages being accessed from the Internet that they could be found by a WEB Crawler before they are ready for release. Because of this, the Router had this option turned off.

As a result the following two questions arose:

    1. Is it possible for WEB Crawlers on the net to eventually 
       get a hit on the thios Router IP and find these TEST WEB Pages?

    2. If so, then is it possible to make Xitami ignore these Crawler requests?

No luck to find this in the Xitami Email Archives. I thought I had seen a recent comment related to Xitami and Crawlers but I could not find it.

Thanks for your time, advise, and help!!!

Jerry

Hello,

I have searched at a lot of places (FAQ, online help, etc.) but cannot 
find any relation to my problem.

I use Xitami 2.5b5 on Win98SE as HTTP- and FTP-server for my genealogy 
presentation. I use CGI (and SSI for logging) with Active Perl. The 
problem is that the server does not push some pages until the end. It 
are always the same pages at the same place. I looked at the HTML-source 
  but can't find errors. Examples:

http://alf4all.demon.nl/roots/zzz/register/surnamelist.htm

works wel but:

http://alf4all.demon.nl/roots/zzz/register/familylist.htm

works not (afther corten - timmers nothing)

Where to look???

Thanks and greetings...

This seems to be more of a perl problem.  Depending on how you coded your
CGI, the speed of the output and when the output gets posted will vary.
Look at your Perl first, Xitami is working fine, its the perl/cgi engine
that is determining the rate/speed and order of your pages being served.

I don't think so

I discovered a bug way back when that was that SSI scripts have a 
maximum size of (if I recall correctly) 32Kbytes plus or minus a bit. 
I.e If you use SSI make sure your entire page is much less than 32KB. 
The problem page is 29379KB long which leads me to suspect that you've 
just run out of buffer.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I just noticed that the SSI include tag (e.g. the one on the testssi 
page <!--#include file="testssi.inc"-->) cuases the rest of the 
including document (e.g. testssi.ssi) after the tag not to get delivered 
if the included document itself uses SSI as the example include does.

SSI returns just fine if the included document itself does not try any 
SSI calls.

This is true using Xitami 2.5b5 (and 2.5b4) with NS6.1, 4.7 and IE5 and 
appears to be a xitami thing in that the HTML is in fact completely 
unfinished. I'm guessing that Xixssi doesn't deal well with the same 
page requiring 2 levels of return.

Also in the process of debugging and playing I noticed that Xitami has a 
limit on files with SSI includes of about 35,000+ bytes (one file 
displayed upto the 35922nd byte, another upto the 35553rd) and any data 
thereafter is abruptly truncated. The limit is not there for pure HTML 
files - I can successfully read 1Mbyte + sized .htm files but the same 
file renamed as .SSI will be truncated around this point even if it has 
no includes.

I removed the SSI commands, so for this pages there is no perl active. 
Same result. Also, it are always the same pages on the same place. First 
I thought about some strange ending code combination. In an earlier 
version of Xitami there was no problem. Spooky...?

Last night I noticed our Xitami webserver was crashing like crazy all of
a sudden. We made no changes and it's been up and running for weeks
since the last reboot of the system. Below you'll find the contents of
our crash.log file. The ones that say "Abort at smtssl:24:(3,9)" I
believe are from the known Xitami/SSL vulnerabilities even though that's
never been verified from anyone at I-Matix. The other ones are new to
me, never seen them before. Perhaps someone can explain what these
messages mean?
We're running xitami on Windows Server 2000 at SP 4 for what that's
worth ...

Hello,

    From time to time, I'll find a line in my access
logs as such:

66.81.155.27 - - [06/Mar/2004:22:10:02 -0400] "GET
/.hash=f7d8f0f1eb69439591c9029a0a4de4513b4b758e
HTTP/1.1" 404 -1 "" ""

    I haven't a clue what this represents.  However,
rather than simply learning it's description, I would
first be interested to know whether this poses a
threat to the security and well being of my network...
and what measures of prevention I should be seeking.

    Thank you for your time.

Rod

I don't know the specifics, but it looks like a buffer overrun attempt for
IIS. Do a search for it on Google.

After much reading and playing I still cannot get the wba to run for =
virtual hosts.  I get "Error 501/505 - Not implemented or not supported"

Here is what I the configs look like

xitami.cfg
admin=3D1

xitami.aut
[/admin]
    Admin=3Dpassword            #   By default, admin access is disabled
    test=3Dpassword

[Private]
    test=3Dpassword

the virtual host file look like this.

test.aut
[/admin]
    test =3D "password"
[/setup]
    test =3D "password"


test.cfg
[Security]
    Filename =3D "test.aut"

The WBA from the main site works fine it is just the virtual hosts that =
don't work.  Anybody been able to get this to work on a windows box?

Did i miss something?  The aut files are in the xitami directory below =
the /webpages dir.

Thanks for your time.

has anybody succeeded in doing a HTTP PUT from the INET control i Windows?
When I try this, I get 403 Forbidden as response, maybe because the

To: Bowden, Zeb
Subject: [SA11139] OpenSSL SSL/TLS Handshake Denial of Service
Vulnerabilities


TITLE:
OpenSSL SSL/TLS Handshake Denial of Service Vulnerabilities

SECUNIA ADVISORY ID:
SA11139

VERIFY ADVISORY:
http://secunia.com/advisories/11139/

CRITICAL:
Moderately critical

IMPACT:
DoS

WHERE:
>From remote

SOFTWARE:
OpenSSL 0.9.x

DESCRIPTION:
Three vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, which can be
exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial-of-Service).

1) A NULL-pointer assignment in the "do_change_cipher_spec()"
function used during the SSL/TLS handshake can be exploited to cause
OpenSSL to crash via a specially crafted SSL/TLS handshake.

This vulnerability affects all versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6c through
0.9.6k and 0.9.7a through 0.9.7c.

2) An unspecified error in a fix added to OpenSSL 0.9.6d some time
ago can result in a DoS caused by an infinite loop.

This vulnerability only affects older 0.9.6 versions with backported
security patches.

3) An out-of-bounds read error exists in a routine used during the
SSL/TLS handshake when using Kerberos ciphersuites. This can be
exploited to crash OpenSSL via a specially crafted SSL/TLS
handshake.

This vulnerability affects versions 0.9.7a, 0.9.7b, and 0.9.7c.

SOLUTION:
Update to version 0.9.7d or 0.9.6m. Recompile any OpenSSL
applications statically linked to OpenSSL libraries.

OpenSSL 0.9.7d:
ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.7d.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.7d.tar.gz.asc

OpenSSL 0.9.6m:
ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6m.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6m.tar.gz.asc

OpenSSL Engine 0.9.6m:
ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-engine-0.9.6m.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-engine-0.9.6m.tar.gz.asc

Subject: [Xitami] sending a domain name locally
Message-ID: <103B6390-7856-11D8-80E9-003065EECE16@frii.com>

Is there a way to include a domain name when
accessing XITAMI locally ?

my XITAMI server is located locally at
192.168.x.y    ( Also available on the cloud
via a router )

I would like to access it via something like
http://192.168.x.y:80:www.mydomain.com
such that XITAMI recognizes the domain name

Is this possible ?


Thanks

Hi,
Gus S Calabrese

Not sure if it will help but I noticed this install that Xitami
will access via the host computer name. Example, when I named my computer I
names it "ronsxppro". Now from any of the seven computers attached to the
router or switch I can access via  http://ronsxppro
Is that what you mean?

Make sure your xitami.cfg is set to the root of your sites. Mine is
different than the defaut xitami/webpages.

(this is the default if you haven't changed it)

	[Server]

	Webpages=./webpages

Now if you enter http://computer_name/site1.com/

site1.com is whatever you have set the directory to (in site.cfg)

Are you confused yet?

Hi,

When trying to access a PHP-file via an alias, xitami seems to ignore
configured aliases:
"usbhtdocs" is configured as CGI-Alias in defaults.cfg.=20
When I try to access e.g. http://localhost/usbhtdocs/info.php, the debug
log reads this:


2004/03/24 12:40:23: Resolving URL request: /usbhtdocs/info.php
2004/03/24 12:40:23:  - URL handled by filter 'C:/Server/PHP/php.exe'
2004/03/24 12:40:23: - requested file
'C:/Server/htdocs/usbhtdocs/info.php' not found

This is what my defaults.cfg says:

[CGI-Alias]
	/usbhtdocs =3D D:\htdocs

Xitami should be looking for the file in D:\htdocs\info.php

The alias btw works fine when reading a non-php file.

Thanks for your hints!

This is a known problem - Xitami doesn't pass the DOCUMENT_ROOT (I think 
its that var) correctly to PHP. There seems to be no way around this as 
what ends up happening is that PHP simply can't find the script.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0403261525490.1528@trillian.uni>

Hello all,

I've had xitami-2.4d9 and php-4.3.1 for some time now with no
problems; however the machine running them died and I've been slowly
putting back the pieces on a new machine; I installed php-4.3.4 and
grabbed xitami-2.5c1.  From the command line, php can parse all of my
web pages and produce html; xitami can serve static pages all day just
fine.  However, when I try to view a .php page, all I get is the message
(from php) "No input file specified."

Which is odd.  Xitami debug logs indicate that it's handing off php
pages to php, and getting something back from php, so it's happy.  I
haven't changed the web sites, and I'm using the same config files as
before (which include the [Filter] and [Mime] entries).  php.ini
includes:

register_globals on
cgi.force_redirect = 0
cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1
doc_root = <document root>

... so I tried installing xitami-2.4d9, since that worked before.  No
dice, same problem.

Am I overlooking something?  I've looked around and I see this error a
lot, but none of the solutions that I've seen have worked for me.



Any hints would be appreciated.

Thanks,
--
Elliott

Huh?  What's the meaning of that "word" at the start of your post?

I *think* that the originator of that idea withdrew and cancelled it,
after it was pointed out to him that:

    1) Whilst he could create a forum, there was no compulsion upon those
    who provide real valuable answers on the mailing list to bother to
    read the forum, let alone provide answers.
    
    2) That there was already an archive of past postings to the list
    (and indeed that the necessary pointers to this are in the headers of
    every post to the mailing list).
    
Forums?  We don't need no steeenking forums.

   fix (vb.): 1. to paper over, obscure, hide from public view; 2. to
   work around, in a way that produces unintended consequences that are
   worse than the original problem.  Usage: "Windows ME fixes many of the
   shortcomings of Windows 98 SE".
