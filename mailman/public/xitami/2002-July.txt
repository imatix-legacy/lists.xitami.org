If you want an excersize in frustration. Then track

I'd watch for ftp hacking attempts and definitely
setup a firewall to protect yourself.

Good Luck.

Subject: [Xitami] Strange "notification" received; from a list member?
Message-ID: <49441@dsl.co.uk>

I've just received the following strange e-mail, claiming that a message
of mine was deleted (by the recipient) without reading.  So I checked
back on the message of mine referenced therein, and found that it was
something I posted to this list exactly two months ago, on the 1st May.

Has anyone else been receiving similar strange "notifications"?  Can the
list owner confirm, or otherwise, that the purported sender of this mail
is a subscriber to the list?

Incidentally I don't, as a matter of routine, include a Return-Receipt-To
header in my mails, and am pretty sure that the list exploder doesn't
(because otherwise everyone would be being inundated with these sorts of
notifications all the time.

[All headers retained, for obvious reasons]

Hmm, exactly two months: could it be that Russell is so far behind on
collecting traffic from his ISP that the latter has deleted it?  (I know
that my ISP does something similar; if mail is neither delivered by SMTP
[for those of us that run our own smtpd] nor collected by POP3, then it
will be bounced back to the originator [as required by RFC-[2]821] after
30 days.  But surely this notification is insufficient to comply with
that sort of bounce mandated by the RFC?)

Thanks for the heads up... I didn't have a server up during the Nimda days
but am well aware of this thing now. As with all the words of warning I have
my ftp secured and have a firewall (did that before I did anything else
actually), I was actually wondering if there was a way for the server to
block access to these attackers BEFORE they show up in my log. Judging from
what I've read I guess they will just pile up in the logs and continue to
try and hack the server. (bastardos)

Thanks,

Rob

they won't harm xitami... other than fill up your log files.

if you want to stop them first - you need a good firewall in front of your
web server...

I use CG Pro for some time now and didn't encounter any of those strange 
behaviour, issues
You can try CGpro for free, http://www.stalker.com/CommuniGatePro
It's a great email (pop & smtp) server and has also mailinglists build in.
Just a nice piece of software.

You're not alone.  I've received several of them as well.

He is not a subscriber under the address in question.  There is a
subscriber under an address which I suspect forwards to that address.

If these "deleted unread" messages continue to arrive then I'll probably
remove that "likely candidate" and advise them they've been removed
until they can confirm their mail system isn't the cause of the
messages.

Any such bounce message should probably be omitted for Precedence: bulk
and other similar "mailing list" messages anyway.  (I've not checked
the RFCs recently but I suspect they say something similar.)  At very
least they should be sent to the mailing list software, not anywhere
else.

Anyway I am aware of the issue, and the message someone else posted that
it was being investigated.  There will be a small grace period to fix
the issue, and if not I'll do what I can at the mailing list end to
minimise the problem.   (However the "deleted unread" messages appear to
relate to old messages already "received", and bypass the mailing list,
so there is a limit to what I can do.)

Hi Melle,

Great utility ... thanx.

Could maybe do with a line that says something like "next if $line doesn't
start with ***.***.***.*** " so that it doesn't quit processing when it
finds binary in the log file.

After a lot of learning (PHP, MySQL and Xitami) the applications runs. There
is only one part that doesn't work an that is the download function, where
you can download a document that is listed in SDMS, There is a server
variable called $REQUEST_URI that has no value.
I guess that one need some kind of confuguration setting within Xitami.

Does anyone know a solution to this problem.

I use SDMS version 1.1.4, PHP version 4.2.1 an dXitami version 2.5b

$REQUEST_URI is not a standard HTTP 1.1 enviromental varible. Its only 
used in Apache 1.21 and above(see http://www.apache.org).

Try $SCRIPT_NAME or $PATH_TRANSLATED in it's place. You might have more 
luck with these.

Also, below are some links to to similar problems with the varible:

trying to use an ssi command with xitami <!--#include file="filename.txt" -->
and the thing just wont work.

My computer will recognize the .shtml extension as a webpage and read that 
page correctly, but whatever file I included does not show up.

Example - marylamb.shtml looks like this:
<html>
<head><title>Mary's lamb</title></head>
<body>
Mary had a little lamb, it's <!--#include file="fleece.txt" --> as snow.
</body>

Fleece.txt looks like this:
fleece was white

But whenever I open marylamb.shtml it just says
Mary had a little lamb, its as snow.

Both files are in my 'webpages' directory.
Is there some option in xitami that I need to turn on in order to make ssi 
work?

I have emulated exactly what you did and all is working fine.
Some things to consider:

Insure that SSI is enabled by opening the Administration screen, =
clicking on Configuration, clicking on SSI, then making sure the SSI =
enabled is checked on.

I also noticed that (and it might be a typo) that below you have =
Fleece.txt as the filename but when you call it in the SSI it is =
fleece.txt so your case switching may be a problem.

Actually, some days it seems like there's as many
infected machines out there as there was in the first
days of Nimda <LOL>...

I don't think it would be possable to block it
entirely before it got to the server. But for the log
files there's a note from M.Konig about a log file
filter that he has. You might want to check it out.

Have fun....

This is weird but probably a normal issue considering the circumstances....

Some people can access my server and some can't.. here's my settings:

I'm using DNS2GO to manage my dynamic IP, so it assigns a regular web
address: http://surfto.27south.com.
All is well with that. In my Xitami settings it states my Hostname is
http://default and the IP addresses are 192.168.1.100 and 127.0.0.1. That
seems normal to me.

My log files are filled with people traveling through the site as normal,
but then I talk with people specifically who cannot access the site even
though the server is running and I am able to access it at the same time
they are not.

Is there a clue in here somewhere for me?

Thanks in advance,

-Rob

Change ip's to all 
your DNS on surfto.27south.com is 66.32.25.233

192.x.x.x

That is an internal address I think

I have been Having Heaps of problems over the last week with DNS2GO.
I was doing a regular service scan on my domain  using
http://domainwhitepages.com/

Although the dns2go client was saying i had "x" IP  the service scan was
telling me i had "y" IP .
stopping and starting the dns2go client sometimes fixed it but not always.
I checked the dns2go site and there was a msg there saying they were having
problems.
seems to be fixed now .

I know some ISP's, especially cable and DSL based ISP's, use a content 
caching system.  So it could be 24 hours before they will show your content.
It maybe a matter of waiting.

Some also mentioned changing your IP address.  I'm assuming you either 
on a LinkSys router or similar setup which will not allow you to do that 
without disabling your mini-intranet.

It's not really a matter of having an up to date page, but a matter of
nothing showing at all for some people. It boggles my mind that half the
world can view the server and half cannot. I'm just completely stumped.

I do use a LinkSys router setup with standard settings. I enabled my ports
(obviously that's why some can get there). I don't really want to disable my
internal network.

Would a static IP solve these issues or are these particular to the Xitami
server?



Signed lost and confused,

I have installed Xitami but unfortunately the FTP server will not start.
I get an error message that port 21 is already in use.
Afaik there isn=92t any any other server running on my pc (win 2k)
I=92m using the ZA pro 3 firewall
Can there be any relation with Xitami or my firewall? Any ideas?
How can I check if port 21 is in use and which application opens it ?
Thanks,
otto

i don't use windows, but it sounds like you have ftp services enabled. a

There's an easy answer to that: don't remotely administer the server via
HTTP!  Either walk into the machine room (or use SSH sessions) and use a
text editor.

HTTP-based administration only exists for the lazy and those who cannot
imagine use of a computer without having thinks to click.

Hi,

if its the server, your mail goes from (lanjouw.com) then it is ProFTPD 
1.2.4 server running.
Just ftp to that server of interest, most ftp servers tell their name on 
connection (in default setting).

Another answer would be to set up some sort of handshaking in the HTTP
protocol (however, I don't see the IETF moving to change that very
quickly).  It isn't that difficult to add a level of security that would
make it much more difficult to crack.  ESMTP already does this with the
header in the first message from the server.  You then run an MD5 hash with
your password and the string sent in the first message and send it with the
EHLO command.  Much more secure than even DIGEST since a replay attack
requires cracking the username and password before a replay can occur.

However, I agree with the use of SSH tunnelling for remote admin.  Yet,
HTTP could offer a little more security than it does right now (which is
basically squat).

Both CGI and SSI works flawlessly, but PHP simply just wont. I'm open for suggestions, tips and good ideas - anything that might make this combo work. :o)

Sokrates 1.6 is available (http://runner.conacom.de)

We worked hard since the last release and can provide support for the
latest Java Servlet API 2.3 (see read.me) now.

Changes since last public release 1.3


05.07.02 1.6  
Added documentation
ServletContext#getRequestDispatcher(..).
ServletContext#getNamedDispatcher(..).
Information about operating system logged.
Attribute javax.servlet.context.tempdir points now to a java.io.File
with a tempdir.
Runner#check_semaphore() is a thread now.
update to API 2.3, not implemented are methods with Java 1.2 return
values (Map, Set).
update to API 2.2.
Session-ID is configurable in the sessionmanager config now
(session_id)
SessionCookie expires with -1 (browser session) again.
removed "queued_startup" parameter. ServletInstance uses LockObject for
synchronizing .init() and .run() which allows faster startup.
Fixed race condition in ServletInstance

16.06.02 1.5  
Speedups in MonitoredExecution (caching, thread reusing). 10 times
faster now.
Event system for shutdown/dispose.
Fixed problem with various un-closed streams (Properties).

14.06.02 1.4  
RunnerClassLoader: added local path to container classpath if classpath
is empty.
getServetName() & getRemoteHost() returning RDNS name (see:
reverse_dns=1/0 in container config).
added logscn_options.
ServletInstance#processError(..): uses rootcause of error now.

Depending on what you are using for a net connection, your internet provider gives a 
Dynamic or Static IP.  It is not a setting you really chose unless your internet provider 
has definatly provisioned you a static ip.  If you "do" have a static IP you'll need your IP, 
your netmask, their router #, and their DNS #s.  I forget the name of the config utility for 
setting this up on the ethernet under linux (been a bit and I haven't used linux that 
much).  But I'm sure someone could tell you.  Just make shure you have your required 
information from your provider.

You'll have to talk to your ISP.  Xitami only works with the IP# it 
given by your OS(any OS).  Xitami can't control or change your IP#.  You 
can BIND Xitami specfic IP through the web control panel, but the OS has 
to already have those #'s.

map to the dynamic IP at all times. Service is free to cheap depending on
what services you want. 
 
Realize that some cable companies will not issue static IP's as a matter of
policy. 
 
I am just a satisfied customer.

You can't do it yourself, unless you order a static IP from RoadRunner.
But, that might be expensive (don't know, never checked the price).  So,
instead,  you can go with an IP forwarding service like www.dns2go.com .
You point your URL (with your domain provider (or just use
www.yourdomain.dns2go.com for free)) to dns2go (They will tell you the DNS
IPs).  Then, you run  their client software on your server that updates
dns2go with your current IP.  Then dns2go re-directs all domain requests to
your current IP.

There is one more problem, however.  RoadRunner blocks port 80 (standard
html port).  So you have to tell Xitami to run your webserver at a port like
6800 or something (read how in the Xitami docs).  You also have to tell the
dns2go client software to portforward requests with a www. prefix to
whatever port you use.  And, bring your FTP port back down to 20 (see Xitami
docs).

Then, your html URL will be www.yourdomain.com and your FTP URL will be
ftp://yourdomain.com .  You have to use the www. prefix or dns2go will not
know to portforward html requests to your new html port (6800 or whatever
you picked), and you have to make sure not to use it with FTP requests, or
dns2go will portforward those to the same port as your webserver.

Its all free (and pretty transparent) unless you want email.  Then they
charge a bit.

Good Luck,

- Jay

In the last few days I have seen several people talk about dynamic name 
services from the likes of dns2go and tzo.com. I am sure they work just 
great but I have never used their services having been a long time user 
of another service that I haven't seen mentioned recently. I stress, I 
am just a user of dyndns and not affiliated with them in any other way!

I use the services of dyndns.org - and having looked at both dns2go and 
tzo.com I would suggest that if you are interested and have a need for 
dynamic IP services you look at what's available from dyndns.org, 
especially from a cost standpoint on the advanced offerings! Everyone, 
including dyndns.org have the free services for basic dynamic IP 
management and will give you a xxxxx.dyndns.org username but the built 
in clients in the LinkSys router and Netgear routers will automatically 
keep your dyndns.org address pointing in the right direction, so to me 
that's a plus (although maybe this is true for the others too... but 
from what I saw on the other sites the client is something you have to 
run on the server itself and if it is a private IP behind a NAT device 
like a Netgear or similar, you may be out of luck!)

The advanced features of dyndns are inexpensive though - just a ONE off 
donation of $30 for each www.yourdomainname.com you want to use and 
you're off and running, managing your own DNS (and they make it easy if 
you are a beginner) that you can always have resolve directly to your 
dynamic IP for anything you want to use it for, including mail (MX) 
support... in fact I have found no real limitations to their services 
at this price... they even support an offline redirect, web hopping 
(for services where port 80 is blocked) and various other tricks.

Anyway, that's all I will say... I am sure dns2go and tzo are great, 
I'm not saying they aren't... but just from what I saw on prices and 
since no one else had mentioned it... I thought I would tell you about 
dyndns.org!

www.dyndns.org

What does your [filters] section look like?  You need to add an entry that
points at the PHP executable for the .php, .phtml, etc. file extensions

If you are having problems with PHP not redirecting properly, you will want
to use the XiFusion wrapper program which fixes that problem.

Hope this helps!

Hi Mike,

I Have been using Argosoft for about 2 years with no problems. It is
extremely stable and has given me excellent service. I run about 5 domains
on it right now with several accounts on each and will be adding more
domains soon. Let me know your trouble and I will see if I can help you.

Another dynamic service to check is No-Ip (www.no-ip.com) They offer third
party dynamic domains for free as well as a couple of other services. Not to
mention they have plenty of tips for the networking newbies.
I have been very happy with thier service over the past year or so...

IA EMail Server by www.TnSoft.com works well. Their support is good.
I like how I can run executables when emails come in or schedule batch
jobs on emails. 
Worth a look.

I've used Xitami for Windows for several years, and it has been extremely
stable. Now I've installed it on a Linux box (Slackware 8.1), and it's not
so stable - more specific, it's the FTP that sometimes just crashes while
uploading to the server.

I have no idea what's going on, Xitami just exits. There are no entrys in
the logs.

Any ideas?

Thomas

ps.My PHP problems is solved. It was quite simple really. If anybody wants
to know how, then just email me at thomas@responsum.dk

Thank you for the answers. Unfortunately i still have the problem.
How can i check on my win 2k machine what is running on port 21?

in the message log i see this:

************* 
I have installed Xitami but unfortunately the FTP server will not start.
I get an error message that port 21 is already in use.
Afaik there isn’t any any other server running on my pc (win 2k)
I’m using the ZA pro 3 firewall
Can there be any relation with Xitami or my firewall? Any ideas?
How can I check if port 21 is in use and which application opens it ?

Anybody who knows how I can make Slackware 8.1 autostart Xitami at boot?

Right now I have to boot linux, log in and manually start xitami with =
./xitami - s

I can't seem to figure out how to "fix" it..

My logfile does not cycle anymore. 

Even if I log into the admin-pages, go to logging and
press the 'cycle now' button, I get the following
error (shown in red in top of page)

"Log file is not active"

What does this mean? 

In my xitami.cfg I certainly have:

[Accesslog]
#   Specifies whether logging is enabled or not. 
    enabled=1
#   Specifies the name of the log file. 
    filename=access.log
    local=1
    format=CLFX

    translate=1

    cycle-time=00:00
    cycle-day=0
    cycle-size=60
    cycle-lines=0
    cycle-arg=ac%yy%mm%dd.log


In other words: how is it possible the accesslog does
not cycle anymore?

   I am running Xitami for OS/2.  I went with a dedicated FTP client as the FTP in Xitami

 I haven't tried Xitami on my XP macine but I guess the NT (Service) version
runs in it just fine. At least W2K has no problems with it.

Xitami has a known crashing problem with heavy server usage when the FTP
server is enabled.  Xitami also has a serious DoS/DDoS issue with large
numbers of CGIs running under Windows (and slows to a crawl with heavy CGI
usage under Linux).

The solution is to get a dedicated FTP server.  The FTP server in Xitami is
not meant for heavy-duty use and tends to crash the server.  Xitami without
FTP is very stable, but you need to be picky in the CGI arena (e.g. PHP)
till that gets fixed.

Hope this helps!

Subject: [Xitami] Installing PHP
Message-ID: <200207072301590447.0048A9FB@smtp.xs4all.nl>

I have installed PHP. when i test it on localhost it's working fine.
When i test it remote i get the following error message:

***********
Security Alert! The PHP CGI cannot be accessed directly. 
This PHP CGI binary was compiled with force-cgi-redirect enabled. This means that a page will only be served up if the REDIRECT_STATUS CGI variable is set, e.g. via an Apache Action directive.

For more information as to why this behaviour exists, see the manual page for CGI security.

For more information about changing this behaviour or re-enabling this webserver, consult the installation file that came with this distribution, or visit the manual page.
***********

In my php.ini file i have this:

; cgi.force_redirect is necessary to provide security running PHP as a CGI under
; most web servers.  Left undefined, PHP turns this on by default.  You can
; turn it off here AT YOUR OWN RISK
; **You CAN safely turn this off for IIS, in fact, you MUST.**
; cgi.force_redirect = 1

; if cgi.force_redirect is turned on, and you are not running under Apache or Netscape
; (iPlanet) web servers, you MAY need to set an environment variable name that PHP
; will look for to know it is OK to continue execution.  Setting this variable MAY
; cause security issues, KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING FIRST.
; cgi.redirect_status_env = ;

any ideas?

If you're running Xitami under Windows you have to disable the
cgi.force_redirect. Locate it in the php.ini file and change it to 0. At
least that was how I made it work.. :o)

Another thing that may cause something like this is if the NT account which Xitami uses does not have permissions to the folder where PHP ... and the scripts ... are installed.

I am running a dedicated FTP server not a part of Xitami.  It looks like users upload into 
their directories then tries to load their files.  Xitami crashes and the batch file reloads it.  
I was wondering is there was a way around this problem or make it happen less often?

I don't get it. You have Xitami and an FTP server on the same box.
When someone uploads ... via FTP utilizing this other server... Xitami crashes ?
Did you turn Xitami off in the .CFG ?

Don't go there. That page has been out of date for years. Go to:

http://www.xitami.com/download.htm

Do you want the stable old 2.4 series or the 2.5 series with new
features not fully debugged? If in doubt, go with 2.4, and
specifically 2.4d9

Win 95/NT bw3224d9.exe [705 Kb] works fine but has to be started
manually (or with trickery). For occasional testing, this is what I
use.

Win NT service bs3224d9.exe [740 Kb] can be told to auto-start, even
before you log-in. This is what I use for unattended full-time
servers.

The "Vanilla Win95" version will probably work, but the NT versions
will be more stable (XP is just NT with new decorations). The Alpha,
Unix, OS2 etc versions won't work on MS Windows. You don't sound
like you want the Source Kit, you want the Install Package.

2.5 adds some new frills, including (I think) a different
implementation of SSI. 2.4's SSI needs Perl installed, so it may be
better to use 2.5 if stability is not paramount. (FWIW, several
people here are running 2.5 perfectly well in heavy use.)

Yes I turned off Xitami FTP so only it's web services are running.  If the users access old 
files it seems fine.  If they access files they "just" uploaded it seems to crash and reload 
Xitami (from my .cmd file I set up for it).

As someone else remarked, the file with name "Fleece.txt" is nothing
whatsoever to do with that named "fleece.txt"; so if the latter doesn't
exist then the SSI would fail to find anything to include

Well fancy that; it didn't find a file, but was clever enough to correct

Is anyone using Analog with Xitami in a Win2K environment? I am having some
trouble getting it to work and not finding much of a reference for it on
the web. Can anyone shed any light on what might need tobe done to get the
two working together?

Hi Mike-

Been using analog w/ xitami for almost a year. 
Don't remember anything particular that I had to 
figure out. Started with   
http://analog.cx/how-to/batch/index.html  and 
set up the config file like the ones they give 
you. What isn't working for you??

I would check out a port sniffer. 
Turn the OTHER FTP server completely off ... at the service panel.
Then see what is listening on the ports.
I would think that there are two apps fighting for the same port.

Unless two programs are fighting for the same memory or communication channel, 
they should co-exist.

Here is a common error befor a crash: 

No such file or directory
Broken pipe
Socket operation on non-socket
Clean-memory assertion failed - xitami.c (208)
Abnormal program termination

Any of this make sense?

Xitami could not find the file or directory to load.  Sounds like the FTP
server is doing some sort of caching it shouldn't...or Windows could be
corrupted or Xitami is corrupted or something is not right.

>Broken pipe

Possibly a further result of the file not opening.  My guess here is that
Xitami is attempting to use a file or socket anyway.  At this point there
is trouble later on whatever the case is.

>Socket operation on non-socket

The client socket has been closed or we are accessing memory we don't own...

>Clean-memory assertion failed - xitami.c (208)

This is (strangely) located at the end of Xitami's execution in main().
I'm surprised the program got that far.  However, it is due to Xitami
attempting to use or access memory it doesn't own or no longer owns.
Xitami appears to be on its way out the door to avoid that great core dump
in the skies whatever the case is.

>Abnormal program termination

It looks like the program exited but then the CPU took over and realized a
memory fault took place during the clean-memory scan.

>core dumped

Hence, the core dump.  So much for avoiding it...

>Any of this make sense?

Nope.  Just extrapolating on what seems to be taking place.

There should be no problem here.  Any Windows sockets provider worth its
salt will only allow one program to own a single port on one IP at one
time.  So, if there are two server programs contending for the same port,
only one gets it.

This could be, but with Windows you never know what the OS will decide to
do next :)  (I'm not an advocate of any OS...I just haven't found any that
I really like).

Hope this helps!

Thanks for theinsight.  If it's any help I'm not running Windows.  I'm running OS/2 4.0 
with Xitami for OS/2.  Double checked and no apps are using ports they should not.

Hmm..  new error.  But with no crash still running:

smthttp:  error on socket 11: Invalid argument

Possible corrupted copy of Xitami? 


Ok as a possible aid and to help prevent DOS attacks I have split my web server onto 2 
machines both running Xitami for OS/2.  One is my primary web server.  The second 
runs all CGIs.  I figure if I get hit with a GCI DOS attack worst they'll do is drag down the 
CGI box.  My primary non-cgi box should keep working smoothly.

try putting your php.ini file in C:\windows
if it is the latest version of php4.2.X they have change things a bit
because of XP I am assuming. php4.0.1 was in C:\winnt
but after I up graded to the latest it wanted it in c:\windows

Could be ?
check the docs online it shows it but the readme says diff...
http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.windows.php
read that

hope that helps

I can see my webpages from explorer(Win95) but not with Netscape, which =

The same message when I boot up linux and try with Netscape.

Netscape more strict than explorer?

FWIW, no, what it means is that the memory usage tracking in the
library that Xitami uses (SFL) has detected that not all the memory
allocated has been freed up.  Typically this means that not all the
"free my memory" logic has been run, which often happens in a crash
situation.  This is primarily present in the code for the benefit of
developers, because if not all memory gets given back each time it is
taken, then eventually the program will take all the memory in the
system!  (It's enabled in the "user" versions as well to try to catch
those hard-to-find situations that occur only for real users.)

These two are actually _caused_ by the clean memory assertion failing;
the state of the program in that situation is saved to help in tracking
down where things might have gone astray.  This is mostly only of use to
developers though, who can match it up with their source code.

Thanks for the new release (and much appreciated documentation!)

I am trying to get Jive (www.jivesoftware.com) going now, but it requires 
me to run some setup tool which is all based on .jsp files. It is unclear 
to me how to get passed the initial page... When configuring the .ini 
file to respond to all /.jsp it responds with the demo app. Probably 
because I did not define class= in the .ini

However, which class should I define there? I have no clue...

I installed on OS/2 and am using Java 1.3.0

Thanks for any hints!

Joachim

i bet that Jive needs JSP.

and JSP is an extension to the Servlet API 2.3 - an extension we don't
support at this time.

but it is in the queue (we wait for some extensions in Xitami 3.0 for
that).

Hello, let me introduce myself. I am a web designer
(strictly client-side) and I have recently downloaded the
Xitami package onto my Gateway 20000, which runs
under Windows 98.I know almost nothing about the
server-side aspect of things, but ya gotta start somewhere,
and nearly everything I know I have learned the hard
way, so.... here I go again!

The main reason I got Xitami was to give myself a home
workshop where I can begin learning the mysteries of
CGI, PHP,SQL...etc,etc.....(I don't plan to become a web host
any time in the near future!)

As far as I can tell, the installation was successful. I did the
PING thing on the DOS command line and it works dandy.
The Xitami icon appears in the tool bar just as it should,
and I can follow the various steps and get to the Admin
screen, etc. When Xitami is turned on, I am able to access
127.0.01 via IE6, otherwise... no go. I believe that's how it
should be, yes?

Naturally, I have 10,000 neophyte questions, but I shall limit
myself. At this point I'd like to accomplish one
concrete, significant goal. I would like to install an elementary
web document just for testing purposes, and log onto it from the
public library. Just to make it happen; to prove that it can be
done. That's all. Nothin' fancy.

Once I've got that down pat, I will feel that I've passed a meaningful
milestone, and can profitably turn my attention to whatever comes
next. Can anybody on this list steer me down the right road
with a few brief and crystal-clear directives (taking into account
my prior knowledge, which is close to zero.)?

I shall be thankful...

When you installed Xitami, you were prompted for some install folder
(usually c:\xitami or c:\program files\xitami). Inside the install folder
there is, among other things, a subfolder called webpages. Anything you
place there can be accessed from the entire world, which include your public
library. For example if you create a page called test.html and place it
there, you can access it remotely using http://YourServerIP/test.htm
I suggest that you rename your test page as index.html which enables you to
access it only by http://YourServerIP
you'll probably find out later why.

I guess this proves that you can further create your own webhost.

Good luck.

Stefan

I would really suggest looking at phpBB. Install PHP and MySQL and phpBB is
pretty painless.

I have it running on a pretty low end system just fine...it is pretty
powerful, lots of features, can really configure it and it is free.

I already run Phorum (www.phorum.org) which is nice as well, but I have my 
reasons to aim at Jive. NNTP + Mail integration being the most important.

Phorum is free as well, as are most other message-board apps. Jive is 
commercial, but it shows :-)

I totally agree with latter comment.
Additionally phBB, due to the community thingy, is most probably better 
supported than any such commercial product.

If I'm not mistaken what your asking is 'Where do I put the files'.  There is a folder at 'C:\XITAMI\WEBPAGES'.  You can get rid of everything inside the folder and put your stuff there.  Thats it for files.

As to logging in from a library and seeing yourself, you'll have to know your public side IP#.  To you it may look like 127.0.0.1, to the outside world you look like '213.52.0.1'.  I put up a little tool that you use to find your public side IP# at http://yumyum.ws/ipplayground.php  Just go there on your server machine and write down your number.  Remeber each time you log off and back on the internet this public side IP# will change.  You can't trust what a program called 'WINIPCFG.EXE' says is your IP#/  Your ISP maybe doing some funky stuff to keep you from running a server.

Other little tidbits about webservers in general:
	127.0.0.1 and the words localhost are the same thing to a computer.
	If want to play around with your setting type in 'http://127.0.0.1/admin'
	Xitami does not do most server side scripting when you install it.  Your have to install things like PHP and Cold Fushion
	Windows based webservers don't care about case(uppercase and lowercase) on file names.  Example: http://127.0.0.1/MYFile.htm is the same as http://127.0.0.1/myfile.htm to a Windows based webserver.  Unix and Linux servers are not so forgiving.  Remember that if your going to put these files onto another server watch your case.

Once I've got that down pat, I will feel that I've passed a meaningful
milestone, and can profitably turn my attention to whatever comes
next. Can anybody on this list steer me down the right road
with a few brief and crystal-clear directives (taking into account
my prior knowledge, which is close to zero.)?

Open the stock top-page that comes with Xitami (default.htm or
index.htm) with wordpad or your HTML editor, scribble "Hello from
selinvict!" on the top, and verify that you see the change with
http://127.0.0.1 (and http://localhost should also work.

Now... to see the page from anywhere else in the world, you need to
know your IP number. If you are on hard-wire, DSL, Cable etc, that
info may be hidden in Network Neighborhood or any special toy that
comes with your net-connect. If you use phone-modem, you get a
different IP number every time you connect. (This may be true of
some high-speed links too, but they stay connected for long
periods.) And some versions of Windows seem very reluctant to tell
you the IP number presently assigned to a phone-modem connection.
What may be easiest is to find a Web-Forum that not only logs IP
numbers but tells you what your IP is.

Anyway, find out what your IP number is. Say the dial-up gave you
321.123.12.13. Leave the dial-up connected and run over to the
Library quick (before the dial-up drops the line or times-out).
Enter http://321.123.12.13 at the library websurfer and you should
see "your page".

Or maybe not. Dial-ups go down a lot. MANY home ISPs block
webservers. They may be using a proxy, where the IP you see at home
is not the IP that is seen by the outside world (and the proxy
server translates packet IP numbers on the fly).

In today's internet, putting up a webserver on a home connection is
not always easy. You rarely get a Fixed IP number with a Home
account. Home webservers tend to be bandwidth hogs, so the ISPs
costs are high. Also ISPs _sell_ Commercial Accounts, so anything a
home user doesn't really need (like fixed IP) is deliberately foiled
to urge you to convert to a (more expensive) Commercial account.

Although this is true, the resolution I use (and which works quite fine) is to 
shutdown, backup (zip) and restart MySQL daily. This apparently cleans something 
up, because since I do this, I have not suffered dataloss or corruption anymore. 
(And this *is* a heavily used DB) Also, use the latest TCPIP stack (4.32 
preferably) to be sure :-)

Joachim

I can understand that: they are probably members of "PartnerWorld for
Developers" or one of the other schemes[1].  So it's not expensive for
them to install DB2.

For most poor mortals (at least, those I would expect to find on this
list), I doubt that there are many prepared to pay the full licence fee
for DB2; IIRC, that's around USD 22,000, isn't it?

I was wondering if anyone has gotten PHP-Nuke to work with Xitami? They say
it requires Apache, but I am obviously happy with Xitami. If this is not
possible, is anyone else running a newsletter/content management/news
system through Xitami? I have PHP and MySQL on a Win2K box and this is what
I am looking for.

Thanks!

I once ran postnuke (a phpnuke descendant) with xitami 3.4d9 and php 4.0.5 
without any problems. Don't understand why I should need XiFusion or 
something. BTW, I think there is too much advertising for this and some 
other products on this list (apart from Xitami of course).
There were indeed some problems, but they were all implementation-related 
and could most often be found in the  various discussion boards and 
buglist. Especially the redirection problem, which is a known bug (has been 
half a year ago, I wonder that it still is) which, as far as I recall, 
stems from an incorrect use of the php redirect function, namely usage of 
relative paths in the redirect which is not conformant with the HTTP 
specification.
_Maybe_ Apache with compiled-in php _corrects_ this improper use. I don't know.
But apart from that (looking at the code of nuke) I can't see any relation 
to the actual webserver used.
BTW, in my opinion, there is no reason to think that any php product 
whatsoever depends on the webserver in use.

getting a member to the PartnerWorld for Developers isn't hard. invent
a product that you will publish in the next 1,2,6,12 month / 1,2,6,12
years, subscribe and you get your account :)

XiFusion handles the redirect Nuke 5.6 uses, bug or not. Some what like
Apache, for some reason pure Xitami does not like it (non-conformant
redirects may very well be the issue) . Hence my life was easier...
I don't really think I needed to use it either but it eliminated a problem I
encountered quick and easily. That's what it is meant to do, and it did it.
I have Nuke setup on both Apache and Xitami, Apache works fine first shot,
Nuke on Xitami gave me some grief. Not a heck of a lot (due to some help)
but some.

Yes there are plenty of places to go for help regarding most Nuke issues...
for instance Nuke Forums is a good place to start.

My response was not meant as an AD for Xifusion ...
I was not aware giving credit where credit was due is an AD.
To some point I agree about advertisements but I'm sure the moderator would
have tapped them on their shoulder and let them know if he felt it was out
of hand. You have to remember some of the products are made for Xitami and
are free. I could see if the author was making $$, then by all means pay for
advertisement,
but these are utilities that authors wrote for convenience and are allowing
others to use them
free of charge.

But the answer to the question still is yes Nuke will work on Xitami.

My thanks to those who have helped me over the
first hump with my Xitami server. I was able to
view a test page quite successfully from the public
library by turning on the server at home, and then
entering the temporary IP number at the library
computer.

But I am wondering, is it possible to give a page
a more durable address - say, a URL or a domain
name? I'm sure the answer is yes, but can anyone
give me a pointer on how to make this happen?

It sure is. I am running a web server with 8-10 domain names at www.trushosting.com. 
First you either need to signup for DNS services. I would suggest www.myserver.org. All 
the help you need is on their site. Second register a domain name, I use 
www.DomainWizardry.com. When you sign up for a myserver.org account your will be given 
name servers, e.g. ns.myserver.org etc. When you signup for your domain name you will 
need to add those name servers. That is pretty much it. There are alot of other ways to 
doing this including running your own DNS instead of myserver.org, but it is much more 
complicated.

Hope this helps,

Jon

	You can register a domain ($20 / year) and then use www.zoneedit.com to host
the DNS service for you (free).

	Then you configure the computer which has a dynamic IP to tell zoneedit when
its IP changes. I do that from a Linux box. I run a script every 10 minutes
(because I do not have a hook for when my IP changes at the Linksys router, so I
just do it blindly / periodically). All it does is to visit a URL. Just by
visiting that URL at ZoneEdit they update the IP address for my domain. So, the
name will be constant but the IP may change as often as you want. All this is
documented at ZoneEdit, you've got to read the instructions there.

	So, I just give friends the name for my computer (say www.mycomputer.com) and
they can connect to it, even though I have a dynamic IP with an ADSL provider.

You've graduated from webhost 101 to 201 now.

You have several options:
    1. Buy a static IP from your ISP.  If your ISP supports static(not 
changing) IP's that you'll pay anywhere from $ .01 to $20 extra a month.
    2. Get a DNS forwarding service.  These service work by linking a 
third level domain(Example: myname.tzo.com) to your IP address.  You 
then put a little program on your server. That program will every few 
minutes yells out to the service and say "I'm here" so to keep you IP# 
fresh. If watch this mail list people will give you serveral services. 
 I personally like TZO.com but other like DNS2GO.com and ww.myserver.org 
work just as well..  Depending on the level of service the offer the 
services will run you from free to $100/month.
    3. Make your own service.  I have a couple of domains that point to 
my home system.  So if someone types in home.yumyum.ws they hit my main 
server which then redirectes them to my server in my house.

"Easy way": get a Fixed IP address. That's how we used to do all
internet machines. Each school was given a block of IP numbers. At
each school a"hostmaster" person or office would assign IP numbers
to new machines, and that IP number is entered in the machine's TCP
configuration file.

Since people prefer typing names instead of numbers, a system
evolved so if you type a name where an IP number would be, the
computer contacts a name-server to translate the name to an IP
number. "DNS" is a Dynamic Name Server (it can be updated
constantly, compared to older systems that were harder to update).
Generally each school maintains a DNS server and contracts another
school to be a back-up in case of trouble.

Al Gore commercialized the InterNet, but ISPs follow the same
pattern. They have a block of IP addresses they can give to
customers, and maintain DNS servers to translate names to numbers.

So you get an IP number, you reserve names for your domain and each
machine, you enter those names and IP numbers in a DNS server. Then
anybody who types the name of your machine will get the IP number
and connect to your machine. Easy.

The DNS server has to be easy to find and very reliable. It is
possible to run your own DNS server but you usually want to have
someone else with an established DNS system to handle it.

A problem with that is: the world is running out of IP numbers. And
anyway it is silly to permanently assign an IP number to a dial-up
user who only needs it a few hours a month. A dial-up service with
10,000 customers often has only 1,000 modems and so only needs 1,000
IP addresses. You get an IP address when you connect, and you lose
it when you disconnect, and next time you will probably get a
different IP number.

Another side is: cable-modem/DSL is "always on" but the ISP may need
to change IP numbers as they grow their system. Customers won't know
how to change their IP numbers. So they ask you to use DCHP, a
protocol that assigns IP numbers when you connect and can re-assign
if needed. (PoET is another variant of DCHP-like service, adapted
for spread networking.) Or to be honest: many ISPs deliberately
change IP numbers from time to time, just to make it hard for you to
run a busy server on a "home" account, so you will pay more for a
Business account.

There is a way to get around impermanent IP numbers. Others have
pointed you to the Dynamic DNS services. When you start your
machine, or your IP number changes, your machine tells them what
your IP number is today. Their DNS server is registered (with the
master DNS systems) to be the DNS server for your domain. When
people type your machine name, they end up at that DNS server which
gives them the latest IP number for you. It is not perfect:
sometimes intermediate DNS servers hold old info longer than they
should. But as you see, it works good for jon and Marcio.

http://www.zoneedit.com/doc/dynamic.html?

Yes, Dynamic Dynamic Name Server sounds redundant. But in fact there
is an extra level of "dynamic" in these systems. Traditional DNS is
managed by a hostmaster, who can make changes any time she feels
like it. DDNS allows users to update info very frequently without
human attention.

For many reasons, it is often better to off-load the whole chore to
a commercial Web Host: someone with a fast connection, established
DNS, and racks of servers they rent-out. Do-it-yerself can be fun,
and sometimes the best way, but a goos web host service can be more
reliable and possibly cheaper all considered.

Yep; and as I said in my footnote, I've been a member of Developer
Connection so that I have the full version of DB2 (in all its versions:
for OS/2, WinNT, AS400, Linux, Solaris and AIX) already.  But my point
was that it's not something that most people would even dream of using.

Moreover, I don't think that IBM have *any* of these developer editions
available for free download for OS/2 any more; they've certainly stopped
putting them on the CDs of DevCon.

Hi:

I am running a Windows Web Server and I have multiple IP addresses from my ISP. They are

Windows NT easily supports multiple IP numbers on one machine. Look

Vance,
didn't mean to be mean with my comment.
Over time it just got a feeling that a newbie might come to the conclusion 
that xifusion is a more or less manadatory prerequisite for sucesfully 
running any php-projekt together with xitami. And this is definitely not 
the case. In some cases it may be a quick and welcome  workaround to some 
problem, in general i think its rather a matter of misconception to wrap a 
coldfusion server around a php-engine.
Most of all, I believe that virtually no problem with a php-projekt has 
something to do with the webserver in use.
Kind regards,
tony

Tony, the only thing XiFusion does for PHP is correct redirection and a few
minor issues dealing with the environment.  When you use the header()
function in PHP under Apache, Apache will automatically modify the redirect
if it is not an absolute HTTP-compliant URL and may perform additional
processing locally (depends on the situation).  XiFusion essentially does
the same thing, but is actually a side-effect of ColdFusion support.  All
XiFusion does is prepare, start an application, and process the results
passing them back to the server for further processing.  The code base is
something to the tune of 700 lines of C code, so it does quite a bit to fix
Xitami.

I will agree that it won't solve all of the world's problems and isn't
always the perfect solution, but it does work well where redirection issues
arise.  PHP will work fine until you encounter a script that uses relative
redirects.  At that point you either have to change the script, modify
Xitami's source, or use a wrapper like XiFusion.

To test this out try the following:

------index.php------
<?
  header("Location: index2.php");
?>
---------------------

------index2.php------
<?
  echo "Hi There!\n";
?>
---------------------

During the first test don't use XiFusion.  The browser will "hang" because
it does not understand the relative 'Location' header (and isn't required
to according to the HTTP/1.1 standard):

HTTP/1.1 301 Redirect
Server: Xitami v2.4d9
Location: index2.php
...

XiFusion v2.6 corrects this problem by making the relative URL an absolute
URL:

HTTP/1.1 301 Redirect
Server: Xitami v2.4d9
Location: http://localhost/index2.php
...

HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Server: Xitami v2.4d9
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 10

Hi There!


As you can see, XiFusion does have use in the area of PHP redirects.
Personally, I don't use redirects since they take too long compared to just
include()'ing the file.

Hope this helps!

SSL is extremely CPU intensive as calculating/generating keys and
behind-the-scenes session management is a very complex process.  You will
want to have enough processing power behind the server to handle all
SSL/TLS and normal HTTP requests.  Too many SSL/TLS requests can quickly
drag a server to its knees and HTTP will be less responsive as a result.

You mentioned Windows Me.  I tried at one time to assign multiple IPs to
one network card by manually editing the registry and it worked somewhat.
I don't know how much mileage you will get from it.  A quick search on
Google found this link:

This is exactly my point. If I want to set a http-header (in any script 
langugage) I don't want the webserver or anything else to correct this for 
me. I want an error to be thrown if something is wrong. People working in 
this environment try to write portable code, but webservers unsolicited 
correcting things destroy portability and readability.

My opinion:

-) modify xitamis source: NO WAY
-) use a wrapper: POOR SOLUTION, camouflages lost portability (and raises 
lots of questions in messageboards)

Let me start off by saying I agree with your opinions, portability is a must
with my apps and I probably could have gone in and changed the script as
well, but... for alot of users editing a package like Nuke this is NOT an
option (as a matter of fact some users should not even have keyboards) and
they would not have a clue on how to follow the source to fix it (or even
follow instructions). I'm not a PHP person I prefer perl for CGI. I
could have fumbled through it (and I did a bit) and got sick of  looking
for, at the time, the unknown.
XiFusion is a viable quick and dirty soulution for me. However if this was
Nukes authors solution to the problem then it's a poor solution.
Personally I think they could have done a few things better with Nuke, for
instance do you think requiring setting php_display_errors=Off is any
better. To me that's another mask... (Ok I know I'm going further OT here)
So XiFusion masks a problem without having to go fix someones elses mess and
I think it does a good job at it too...

I hope Thomas's reply is helpful. What I would do with any WinMe
machine that made me unhappy is throw it off the building. Or wipe
it and install a "real" network O/S.

In fact, MS may have deliberately made it hard or impossible to give
Me multiple IP numbers, just so you would have to spend for NT.

Are you sure you need multiple IP numbers? You can do a LOT with one
IP number and Xitami's Virtual Host system. (I do not know if SSL
from various clients needs distinct IP numbers.)

Actually, to be picky, DNS stands for Domain Name Service (or System), so

were'd you learn this from?

DHCP is designed to assign the same IP to the same adapter if the network
permits it. each NIC has a specific identifier code, somehow (and I have no
clue how) each NIC sniffs out the DHCP server, and talks to it. then, based
on the info the DHCP server is given, a IP is assigned. a good example is
me. I have an external DSL modem/router and use DHCP. using a standard
network switch DHCP assignes each NIC a public IP. they've only changed when
the network did. for example, up till last week, the NIC in my computer was
4.63.10.123, same as it was the day I got DSL and was using it to test the
connection (it was in a second PC, I was using a USB NIC) and when I
switched back, it recieved the exact same IP address, amazing

PoET isn't a protocol, it's a program for PPPoE which I'm not sure how it
works.

Dynamic DNS was already explained.

You can use sockets to send email:

  use Net::SMTP;
   my $smtp = Net::SMTP->new($smtp_server, Debug => 0) || die "unable to
create Net::SMTP object $smtp_server.";
   $smtp->mail($Webmaster);
   $smtp->to($Email);
   $smtp->data();
   $smtp->datasend("From: $Webmaster\n");
   $smtp->datasend("Subject: $subject\n");
   $smtp->datasend("\n");
   $smtp->datasend($message);
   $smtp->dataend();
   $smtp->quit();

You can either hard code the your email address or have it passed in from
the variables like is set up here.

I appreciate the excellent response I got recently
on my query regarding server addressing, and that
information is filed away for when I will need it.

I am ready to venture some baby steps in the
realm of server-side programming. It seems
that PHP/mySQL is quite the thing to learn
these days. What I'd like to do, is throw
together an extremely simple database
application using these technologies. The
word is 'simple' - just so it WORKS and
provides a hands-on demonstration of
the rudimentary procedures.

Can anybody briefly outline the steps
to make such a thing happen? This would
include whatever is needful to activate PHP
and mySQL within the Xitami server, what
to place in which directory, and what magic
words to enter at which location to make the
whole shebang fire up. (Perhaps there are
downloadable scripts online somewhere that
I can just plug-n-play?)

At any rate, feedback would be
greatly appreciated.

For what it's worth and this isn't the networking 101 mailing list... 
but the DHCP server is listening on the broadcast address of whatever 
subnet everything is set to (usually in a 24bit subnet that would be 
x.x.x.255)... If there are routers between the subnet of where the 
client is and the (different) subnet of where the DHCP server actually 
lives on then the router(s) will have a helper address programmed in of 
where to forward on the DHCP request from the client... This is a 
really simple answer and I won't go into any more detail - if 
anyone wants to understand subnets, subnet masks and bootp broadcasts 
etc. in more detail then you will find plenty of information on the web.

IE doesn't support that header as far as I know.  Actually, to be brutally
honest, both IE and Netscape rely on the HINTERNET set of functions
provided by Windows.  That set of functions wastes bandwidth by (usually)
sending out two requests for a webpage instead of one (for GET, two GET
requests - for POST, one POST and one GET).  I wouldn't be surprised if IE
depends on HINTERNET to do the entire decoding/translation and doesn't do
it.  Netscape might do post processing on the data if that header exists.

Hope this helps!

And if it were simple enough to explain it all here, then everybody
would be an expert and it wouldn't be "quite the thing".

And of course this mail-list is primarily for the webserver, not the
add-ins.

But here's the nutshell. Get PHP from the obvious place. Install it.
Read the documentation. As I recall, it is pretty clear about how to
hook it into a webserver. (Hint: in Xitami Admin, Filters, ".PHP" =
"C:/PHP/PHP.EXE" or something like that.)

I think PHP comes with sample pages.

Get PHP doing things first. In many ways, PHP is almost all you need
for many things. It has some database functionality built in.

But when you are sure you need an SQL-level database, get that,
install it, read the documentation.

Much info for PHP and mySQL is available on-line at the obvious
websites.

Every ethernet NIC has a unique serial number (MAC number) burned
into ROM. I have not disassmebled any cable-modem boxes but they
must have the same or similar functionality (possibly in the cable
head-end rather than the modem, considering the origins of 2-way
cable TV).

DCHP uses whatever rules the admin sets.

Traditionally, you get ("lease") an IP for a period of time, an hour
or a week or "indefinite", and can renew the lease when it expires.
And traditionally it provisionally reserves the MAC=IP association
for hours or weeks after the DCHP lease expires unrenewed. If you
come back on-line within that time, and the DCHP server has not been
forced to give "your" IP to another NIC, then you get the same one
again.

However, give some people a tool and they abuse it. Some home ISP
services aggressively thrash DCHP so you won't keep the same IP
number for very long. After all, they sell fixed IP service at a
higher price, so why let you have the same thing for cheap?

  Does anyone know of a version of Xitami where relative redirects (not
  PHP) work as expected... ie. a relative redirect is actually relative???

  I ask, as I've been testing a groupware product ;

      http://www.neoint.com/ioffice2000/

  running on Xitami.. (which isn't a listed as supported server.. but I'd
  prefer to not need to re-enable IIS... ;>) but it relies on 302
  redirects to executables, and due to a seeming dup of Francis's (though
  the first char is not dropped in my case (running 2.4d9 NT service
  verson) described issue below.. I'm stuck getting 404 errors... as it
  redirects to the root dir and from there can't run a cgi executable...

  THANX in advance...

Using the standard CGI.pm you can (theoretically) redirect people to a 
URl doing something like
print $query->redirect("destination.url"). This prints two lines to STDOUT

Status: 302 Moved
location: destination.url

And normally you get a redirect from there.

It works is my destination.url is a fully defined 
http://host/path/file.html or similar

But I have found 2 bugs in this with Xitami when one uses a non absolute URL

with a file only relative url (just file.html) it chops of the leading 
character to produce a redirect to ile.html in the ROOT of the webserver 
. i.e. the absolute URL is http://host/ile.html
with a path and file relative url (/path/file.html) the redirect never 
completes and xitami just sits there serving up nothing until you hit 
cancel - conceivably there is a timeout after 120 seconds or whatever 
but I didn't wait that long.

This does not appear to occur with Apache which handles both relative 
URLs just fine. Arguably this is a bug with the redirect generator as  
RFC 2616 (http 1.1) section 14.30 states that only absolute URIs are 
allowed for the location field, but it would be nice to see it 
documented if not fixed.

14.30 Location

   The Location response-header field is used to redirect the recipient
   to a location other than the Request-URI for completion of the
   request or identification of a new resource. For 201 (Created)
   responses, the Location is that of the new resource which was created
   by the request. For 3xx responses, the location SHOULD indicate the
   server's preferred URI for automatic redirection to the resource. The
   field value consists of a single absolute URI.

Hmm; interesting.  Presumably the mail() function issues an SMTP "MAIL
FROM: <$Webmaster>" and awaits a positive response?  What happens if it
gets a temporary (or permanent) error response?

>    $smtp->to($Email);

and then a "RCPT TO: <$Email>".  Again, there are various legitimate
responses to this, and only a few of them indicate success.

>    $smtp->data();

followed by a "DATA" command.  What happens to the script if any of these
operations encounter a non-success response from the remote SMTP server?

>    $smtp->datasend("From: $Webmaster\n");
>    $smtp->datasend("Subject: $subject\n");
>    $smtp->datasend("\n");

OK, that's two header lines, and the blank line that separates the header
from the body.  Does Net::SMTP automatically insert such (nowadays
mandatory under RFC-2822) headers as "Date:"?

>    $smtp->datasend($message);

Presumably the datasend() function is capable of sending the embedded
newslines?

>    $smtp->dataend();

which presumably sends the "." on a line of its own, to terminate the
DATA transfer.

What happens if the remote end fails to accept the message at this point?
RFC-2821 makes it quite clear that unless the SMTP client has received a
"success" code following the end of that part of the exchange, it must
NOT assume that the mail has been successfully sent, and undertake to
requeue it in some fashion.

>    $smtp->quit();

It strikes me that all these functions should return error conditions,
and the script be written to handle such errors gracefully.  Did the
author assume that a mail transfer will always execute without error?

Not sure why you want to pay $400+ for a product that looks horrible.  If
you want a piece of software like that but looks and runs better, I'll
develop it for Nuclear Vision (which is by far a cheaper, more versatile
product) and you won't have this problem and will end up spending less money.

However, if your company has made the unfortunate decision to purchase that
software, you can use XiFusion with Xitami to fix the problem.  Both
Nuclear Vision and XiFusion are products of Shining Light Productions.

Hope this helps!

Hi Thomas,

   THANX for replying... I took this off list as it's definitely
   Off-Topic...

   Actually what I had been looking for was a simple groupware application
   that has a DB backend.. and whiteboard functionality... to allow my now
   way too small a solutions design and support group a collabware
   solution that wasn't as heavyweight as the one Cisco typically supports
   and if we sign up they will design and support (in months) a version to
   our needs.. but then we loose control and it takes too long.. but for 5
   to 10 users and something that installed and ran in 5 minutes.. (except
   for the redirect issue..) the price tag though not free... seemed to be
   reasonable.. and that thing had way more than we would typically need..
   for simple schedule, project and case tracking... yet still was a
   really small footprint on a system...

   I have researched numerous freeware pieces.. to do the same thing.. but
   just don't have the time to glue it all together... so was opting for a
   bundled $70-80 a seat solution that wasn't completely optimum.. but on
   first glance seemed pretty simple to get running and configured in a
   hurry...

   Given my druthers ;>) I would have enjoyed having a freeware or one
   time cost solution to reuse on a project/project basis, thus perhaps
   using VHOSTs to allow a Project based setup.. and thus also allow
   customer access to their project... ...and had thought of cobbling
   together a prepackaged freeware set from;

     Xitami - as the Web/(low usage) FTP server Server

     WhiteBoard/Chat - http://hem.fyristorg.com/matben/

     Backend DB/Info Portal - http://j.iis.free.fr/

     Simple Forum/listserv and/or Wiki addon.. - some Perl or PHP freeware
       from the multitudes available...

   If only I ever have some free time... ;>)

   I had seen (many times ;>) your Xifusion as an answer for resolving
   this issue with PHP (thus my comment in the original email ;>) and
   Coldfusion, but wasn't aware it was totally generic in it's benefit..
   so I will give it a try...

   THANX for the help...

                                         Best Regards,
                                              Jim

Use the system() command.  Be sure to grab the output (if any) and display
it to the user.  If there is no output, the e-mail was sent successfully.
Nuclear Vision allows for refined control of the e-mail building and
sending process with detailed error messages when they occur.

Type smtpsend -? at the command-line for detailed help.  Also, the
readme.txt file describes program usage.  SMTPSEND is a sub-set freeware
program of Nuclear Vision and only demonstrates a very small portion of the
power of Nuclear Vision.

I suggest you dig somewhere else for the real problem. What does the

Does xitami crash within seconds after handling these requests?

Well, when I get the message that Xitami crashed, this always seems to be
the last entry in the log around the time that it happend.

The most recent log is xi020714 and it contains the following:

 2/07/14  1:44:58: smthttp: preparing for connections on port 80
 2/07/14  1:44:58: smthttp: ready for HTTP connections on port 80

Nothing there looks odd to me.


>Does xitami crash within seconds after handling these requests?

I don't know the exact time after, but each time I check the log, there is
what looks like the code red attack.

Is there any place else to check for anything? I'm new to the program and a
bit lost now as to what is happening.

Thanks!

It seems that this is the reason for crashing.

Indeed, nothing odd.

You might want to look up a file called memtrace.lst in xitami folder.
It won't be very useful for you I guess, if you find it, but somebody who's
comfortable with the xitami sources might be able to help you.

Another idea would be to turn on the debugging mode and check the extended
logging. Be aware that these logs will be huge since they log EVERYTHING the
server does.

Good luck.

Many domain registars now include the ability to use their DNS so that
is a service you should not need to pay extra for.  www.registerfly.com

Also if you pay for a static IP address you should not need a domain
forwarding service.

Hostheaders are ultimately the way to go.

You've graduated from webhost 101 to 201 now.

You have several options:
    1. Buy a static IP from your ISP.  If your ISP supports static(not 
changing) IP's that you'll pay anywhere from $ .01 to $20 extra a month.
    2. Get a DNS forwarding service.  These service work by linking a 
third level domain(Example: myname.tzo.com) to your IP address.  You 
then put a little program on your server. That program will every few 
minutes yells out to the service and say "I'm here" so to keep you IP# 
fresh. If watch this mail list people will give you serveral services. 
 I personally like TZO.com but other like DNS2GO.com and ww.myserver.org

work just as well..  Depending on the level of service the offer the 
services will run you from free to $100/month.
    3. Make your own service.  I have a couple of domains that point to 
my home system.  So if someone types in home.yumyum.ws they hit my main 
server which then redirectes them to my server in my house.

That is somebody who has a good old copy of  the Nimda virus running. 
 Nimda works by flooding your server's buffers.  Once the buffer is over 
flowed someone could insert functional computer code onto your system.

Xitami isn't directly effected by the virus, rather it either ignore the 
request and goes on or crashes.  I know that my 2.4d9 is perty good at 
handling Nimda.  2.5 anything is not the best.

What version are you running?

I get thousands of these a week from all over the world. I'm not
crashing and other Xitami users here are handling it fine. It bloats
the log-files, that's all.

The over-sized request is a deliberate attempt to break into MS IIS
webserver. It is very specific to unpatched IIS and products based
on IIS; no other software can be be infected.

The over-sized request can confuse and crash some non-IIS software
that never expected over-sized requests. Several network printers
and some routers lock-up or die after one of these.

Unlike IIS, written by children, and printers with a web interface
that is only a frill, Xitami was written by adults who won't take
candy from strangers without examining it carefully and safely.
Request buffers are checked and don't overflow. And even if they
did, the code that Red/Nimda tries to inject would not run in Xitami
because it needs to hit a specific place in IIS's code.

>  this always seems to be the last entry in the log

At the height of these epidemics, over half of my logs were
Red/Nimda requests. On a low-traffic server, the odds are high that
the "last log entry" would be one of these.

Xitami sometimes has trouble rotating its logs, a problem that gets
worse when under heavy traffic as from these epidemics. Especially
on Windows which does get sluggish with thousands of files in one
folder. It seems to help to clear out any temporary or odd-name
files in the logs and temp folders.

Do you have a second machine that is networked, always on, and has
Perl? I have a little script to read a web page at intervals and
report if it isn't there (or does not have an expected phrase, to
distinguish the right response from error-messages). That would
narrow down the actual time of crash.

  Hello all,

  I am having problems getting my site listed in the major search engines.  
Even with free sites like Geocities, I was able to at least be listed in  
Google.  Is it because the search engines look at sites hosted on your own

help or advice would be appreciated!  I have gone to great lengths to 
compile meta tags, and title indexes.  I know of people who don't even use 
meta tags, or go to any effort to list their sites, yet they are listed way 
up in them, and it has just gotten frustrating to me.. Thank and I hope 
everyone is doing well!  have a good day.

  PS:  Would someone send (to my email address), the exact link that I need 
to use to come read, and post to this list online, without reading and

If you don't pay don't expect to see anything for at least 4-8 weeks. 
 There are so many sites going up each hour that they are back logged.

BTW: Wait 30-45 days before you re-submit.  Anything earlier will get 
you blacklisted as spammer.

it is an arcane science, akin to alchemy, getting listed in the engines.
There are folks who will charge you money to do it but here there are 2 esy
ways, aside from the meta-tag and wait method.

1) make firends with the appropriate category editor at dmoz.org, the Open
Directory Project.  Once a site is in there (well, after a couple weeks) it
get's populated to all the sites that license the directory.  Categories are
edited by volunteers.  If there isn't someone for your category, volunteer
yourself.

2) sign up for Lycos's InSite service which get's you into their version of
the FAST catalog, and will also give you a search utility to run on your
site.  There are other services, but an independant survey found lycos to be
the best for the money.

3) go to searchenginewatch.com and read up on it... many many strategies
there.

good luck

Use the ODBC SQL Server driver with whatever application you want to use.
You have to manually add databases to ODBC for each driver source you wish
to use, but once set up properly, you can use one code base for all databases.

Hope this helps!

firewall.  I'm wondering if there is some configuration option in Xitami I'm
missing or something.

Hoping this makes sense to someone...

Greg,

Your data channel is never being established because FW-1 is not letting the 
FTP server through to connect back to your client.

You can usually get around this problem by using your FTP client in passive 
mode, where the client initiates both command and data channels with the FTP 
server. However, this is going to require Firewall-1 to be configured to let 
a range of ports open to the FTP server.

While this is not a problem with a NAT-ted setup, you may encounter 
"political" management resistance ;-)

I hope this helps.

Regards,
Fabien.

If you want to diagnose connection problems with your FTP server, you 
should be looking at your FW logs not the output of your FTP server. 
The logs will tell you more about what is going on and will show 
accepted and dropped packets.

FWIW: FW1 can handle passive connections just fine. Checkpoint has 
inspect code built in for the ftp service and can open the correct 
dynamic ports for each session.

There is a bug/limitation in earlier versions (even 4.1) of Checkpoint 
where the passive sessions for multiple files can eventually start 
running into the listed ports - then FW1 thinks that the dynamic port 
requests are invalid and will close the session. This only seems to 
happen with certain combinations of clients/servers and where they 
decide to start opening dynamic ports... just thought I would mention 
it, I don't use Xitami's ftp server, I got bit a long time ago by it 
and I have never forgiven it! I use ServU and have never had an issue 
and all my traffic goes through a Checkpoint FW.

More help for Checkpoint can be found either at their knowledge base or 
you can find a lot of great information at www.phoneboy.com

Hi!

I´m trying to make a simple perl/cgi script work with xitami on a windows
xp.
I´ve have installed Active-perl, but when I get xitami to point it`s cgi-bin
directory to the right location of the script (actually when it points to
any directory), I can`t acces this directory through its allias "cgi-bin".
When I use the absolute name, I can, but the script doesn´t work of course
(the browser wants to download or execute the *.pl file)

Any suggestions?

Thanks:

Carlos

    Have you changed the path in the Xitami filters to the path where your
Perl is located alot of people have that problem.

Hi all. 

I need help with the xitamipro (evaluation version). 
I need to assign a password protected directory on
a virtual domain but I don't know how to define
the directory in the defaults.aut. 

I know [Private] will point to the private directory of
the "webpages" dir but the dir I want to protect is above it
off the main xitami root. 

For example:  Xitami/example/private/

I tried to do a [Xitami/example/private] in the aut file but
it doesn't seem to be the right syntax. 
Tried [//Xitami/example/private] hoping it would see the dir but it
didn't. 

Any Ideas? 

TYIA.

You need to define an alias first and then password protetc the alias

i.e. in defualts.cgf have a line under alias called

Private = "C:/xitami/example/private"

And then in defaults.aut have (webmask is optional)

[Prvate]
    Userid = "password"
    Webmask = "ip.add.re.ss"

Netscape does not translate the spaces in file names properly.  Replace 
the spaces with underscores or dashes.

Xitami is just attempting to open a file called (assuming default install):

c:\xitami\webpages\video_k\newtest.wmv-getrightdownload

If this file does not exist, you will get a 404 error.

>Any other ideas?
>> >to use a download manager. Is resume supported?

Considering that the headers Xitami returns does not have the
'Accept-Ranges' header in them, I would have to say that the answer is
'no'.  However, my answer is non-authoritative in this aspect...Ewen?

Hope this helps!

Hi
Although I can't answer your Q re Downloading via http with Getright, I can
offer another solution.
Use Xitami's ftp server.
If your Links were  ftp://yourdomain/somepublicFTPdirectory/movie1.avi
getright should have no problem with that.

Thanks - now all I need to do it get ftp working ;-(

I am able to connect when I am within my home nework, but not from outside..

I have set up my DSL router to forward port 21 to port 21 on the machine
with the ftp server.

I am using passive mode on my the far end.

The far end seems to connect then tries to read the contents of the folder -
it then times out and gives an error.

Any ideas?

Thanks

Disable passive mode on your FTP client.  Unless it is "smart" enough to
understand protocol level commands, it won't allow anything through.  Your
end node has to accept connections through its firewall/routers or you
won't be able to do FTP data transfers.

>The far end seems to connect then tries to read the contents of the folder -
>it then times out and gives an error.

Disabling passive mode should fix this problem.  If it doesn't, then you
won't be able to FTP either way since there are two firewalls not willing
to talk to each other in the way.  You can try setting up a range of FTP
ports for incoming traffic to the server, but that opens a whole other
security issue that I don't have time to deal with.

Hope this helps!

Hello,
I am trying to implement SSI in Xitami 2.5b.
I set up the config file to enable SSI, renamed the default to default.shtm
and when the default page loads I get a "[Xitami SSI:]" message displayed in
the very top left corner of the index page. Any idea on what that is? I would
assume that if it is error, there would be an error code associated with that?

Thanks,

-J.

The success you have with FTP will depend on how well your router handles
these requests.
Here is an explanation of FTP that might shed some lite.

Hi guys,

A newbie question:

I am using xitami as web server working with an app
server.  The function of the webserver are: receive
all port 80 calls, virtual hosting.

We have set up an index.htm page for each virtual
websites.  From the index page, a java script
re-direct to another page run by the app server.  The
app server take port address 8080 calls.

ie
sample.com points to ip, 66.66.66.01
Xitami pick up the call and point to: index.htm
http://sample.com shows index.htm and jump to 
66.66.66.01:8080/servlet/sample/home.jsp

how can i make it transparent so that home.jsp will
show as http://sample.com/servlet/home.jsp instead of
showing ip address and port?

Thanks
Just

You could use a frame on the first page and open the second in the frame.

The address of the frame will be shown then and none of your subsequent
address changes will show.

Hello,
I am trying to implement SSI in Xitami 2.5b.
I set up the config file to enable SSI, renamed the default to default.shtm
and when the default page loads I get a "[Xitami SSI:]" message displayed in
the very top left corner of the index page. Any idea on what that is? I would
assume that if it is error, there would be an error code associated with that?

Ewen -- are you there?

Yes, PERL is installed. CGI stuff works great.
(http://www.tahoecabinrentals.com)
Here's a snippet from the cfg file for the SSI: (I don't know if you would
need to see other parts as well)

[Begin snippet]

[Cgi-Alias]

#   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   SSI configuration section
#
#   This section controls Xitami's built-in server-side includes (SSI)
#   handling.

[Ssi]
#   Lets you enable/disable SSI handling.

    enabled=1

#   Specifies the format for times shown by SSI pages.

    timefmt=%A, %d-%b-%y %H:%M:%S %Z

#   Specifies whether size should be shown as bytes or as
#   abbreviations (Kb, Mg). Anything other than the string "bytes" is
#   taken to mean that sizes are shown as abbreviations.

    sizefmt=bytes

#   The timeout for CGI programs called from the SSI agent.

    timeout=30

#   Error message shown when an SSI command fails. The %s symbol is
#   replaced by the cause of the problem.

    errmsg=<p>[xitami SSI: %s]

#   If 1, allows CGIs to be executed using the #exec command. Since
#   this is a security weakness, this option is switched-off by
#   default.

    exec=1

[end snippet]

Thanks,
-John

that was the defaults.cfg and not xitami.cfg?
is perl set in your PATH;
check the cgierror.log and the accsess.log
it may help to turn debuging on
what shebang line are you using #! /usr/bin/perl

Hi I have actually done this with a perl script and had the script return
the page request.
The script was even named index.html so that the browser never even knew it
was opening a script.
I used this script to protect files from direct access.

If you have perl skills and want to pursue this drop me a line directly
garry@cable.net.nz and I will see if I can dig this up for you.

The only other way is to run the servlets direct from Xitami using the 
servlet runner at http://runner.conacom.de

If you do a web redirect then the browser will show the URI of the new 
location unless you use a frame.

If you want to do frames/redirects then you can do it server side 
insetad of client side using GSL / XML if you have xitami 2.5b5.

The enclosed script will do this and shoud be self explanatory

.-  Redirects you to another port on the same server. Either as a redirect or

.-    relo.gsl?p=PPP&m=C&t=TTT
.-    where PPP is the port for the redirect
.-    C is either an R for redirect or an F for frame
.-    TTT is a title used to give the frame mode a title. It is ignored in R mode
.-  or use as the script for a service.xml script

Or you can use ZoneEdit's cloaking function. What it does is once the person
hits the redirected page, the address stays in the address bar, granted you
use the virtual domain for all your linking.

Try looking at the http://www.zoneedit.com site. This service is free for
the first five domains.

Just another option.

Subject: [Xitami] Username/Password problems (newbie)
Message-ID: <115380-220027129164613492@M2W097.mail2web.com>

Okay, so this is going to seem like a stupid question, but I have to ask
anyway...

I installed Xitami a few months ago to test CGI scripts locally on my
computer. At that time, I gave myself a username and password somehow that
work fine on my computer. Unfortunately, now that I've been using the
program for a while, I forgot what I did that worked. I've tried changing
the admin password as per the instructions in the FAQ, and that doesn't
work. I've tried creting a new user (writing the 2 files - also as per the
FAQ) and that doesn't work either. I can still use my own username and
password on my computer, but I'm trying to help my employer install Xitami
over the phone so he can view the CGI files I've made, and he can't get any
passwords to work. Any suggestions?

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami under Mandrake
Message-ID: <006201c2374f$7e792d90$2c182341@crestron>

Hello all,

I installed a Mandrake 8.2 machine last week (first time ever experience
with Linux).  It seems to work fine.  I have a MS Windows Xitami server
running already for about a year now.

I DLed the Unix version of Xitami.  Compiled it as it said in the Unix.html
(after figuring out how to load GCC).  I have a file called Xitami in the
/usr/xitami-24d9 folder.  It comes up as an executable icon in KDE.  I can't
seem to run it.  I clicked on it in KDE logged in as a user and as root, and
nothing seems to happen.  To be sure, I http://localhost in konquerer.  But
to no avail.

When I ping localhost, I get the following (I assume this means its
responding):

64 bytes from localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=152
usec

So how do I "run" Xitami under Mandrake is my main question I guess.  Also,
how do you determine what IP address has been given to a Linux machine under
DHCP?

I realize these are actually Linux questions, but I figured some of you
Linux thumpers might wanna help out a guy who is considering becoming a
convert..

Thanks,

Jay Aldrich

Oh your Windows boys. Not that I am any sort of unix-head.... more
like an MS-DOS head.

Don't believe everything, sometimes not anything, a GUI shows you.
Just because a file is tagged executable does not mean that just
running it is going to do any good. Try running `more'. Utterly
useless until you give it something to do.

> how do I "run" Xitami

Open a unix command window (some call it a shell prompt). No, do not
ask me where a GUI unix hides the command line. Sometimes you have
to telnet to itself. Then issue these commands. Remember that unix
is case-fussy!

 cd /usr/xitami-24d9
 Xitami -h

See what it says. You probably have to start it with command line
switches to tell it what to do (which is why clicking pictures isn't
going to do any good).

I understand that pinging has nothing to do with http.  I was just letting
everyone know that the networking is properly configured.  I am not a
beginner, I've been using computers for over 25 years.  I am just a beginner
at Linux.  I imagined it was a shell command.  I just don't know the syntax.

I tried running xitami from the prompt already using xitami and now I have
tried xitami -h.  I am in the usr/xitami-24d9 directory.  I get the
following:

bash: xitami: command not found

Sounds like xitami is either not marked as executable or your path
information is set up incorrectly.  I'm going to assume the latter as it is
more likely (you can edit your .bashrc file later to add the proper
information to the path and change other default bash settings).

Try ./xitami from the usr/xitami-24d9 directory.

If xitami is not marked as executable (if it isn't, there is probably
something wrong with the build), try chmod 700'ing the file.

Hope this helps!

That was it.  I was thinking I must have missed a step somewhere.  All I did
was compile it.  So, I will research editing the default bash settings so
that the path information will be set correctly, as you said.

It still doesn't launch all the way, as it says ports 80 and 81 are already
in use.  I didn't tell Mandarake to load any servers during the install.  I
think I might have seen something about it loading a firewall (no choice)
during the install, though.  The only "packages" I loaded during the install
was office, games, configurations tools, and KDE and Gnome.  If anyone has
any idea off the top of their head, I'd appreciate it.   Otherwise I'll just
poke around until I figure it out.

Thanks,

Try starting it agai.. use ./xitami -b 5080 -s   this does 2 things...
the -b 5080 makes it port 5080 and -s runs it in the background... the try
you browser http://localhost:5080  if that works then you will have to

Didn't seem to help.  Funny thing is, that it works fine if I'm logged in as
root.  I'd rather not be logged on as root all the time until I get a little
more familiar with the system.

So, it seems that its a user profile configuration issue.  Something in the
user profile is blocking ports 80 and 81.  Sounds like a security setting.
I tried running a program called BastilleChooser (in the documentation), but
I can't find it anywhere using find tools, and its obviously not in the path
as well.

Ahh...the wonderful "port is <1024" issue.  Yeah, you can't run anything
below 1024 except as root under some conditions (that can be disabled
somewhere...).  I haven't messed with Linux for a while, but I recall
adding Xitami to the boot process (init<something>...) seemed to fix the
problem for me.  Since the extent to which I use Linux is to compile and
test XiFusion before distribution, it doesn't matter if I just log in as root.

Yep, that was the problem.  It won't run on any port <1024 unless I am
logged on as root.  It works fine on anything higher than that.  Does anyone
know how to get around this?

I am impressed!  It dishes out files pretty damn fast.  Its only using a AMD
PR133 processor!  Its almost as fast as my AMD Athelon 1400 server.  Check
it out.  I put a reasonably graphics intensive page on there.

http://65.33.185.250:5160

I got a AMD K6-2 366 (as fast as the MB will go) on ebay for it for $10 on
Ebay that I should get tomorrow.

Thanks again,

- Jay

In Mandrake add the start up command line to the end of the file 
/etc/rc.local.

When you boot it will start up Xitami as root, that is what I do 
on my machine.

OK...now I am getting frustrated. I keep getting an error from Xitami
(running on Win2K with SP2) that shuts down Xitami and tells me that an
error message/log has been created. But, it does not seem to do that. I
look at the errors.log that is dated that day. However, the last entry is
at a little before 1:30pm and the error was created at approximately
8:20pm. Am I looking in the right place for the error notifications? This
is really frustrating to me. I'd like to find out the cause and stop it.

Also, is there a way to gracefully recover from this type of problem? I
know there is a recovery setting in Xitami and I have "checked" that
option...but it does not seem to do a damn thing for me.

Any help at all for a newbie would be MUCH appreciated!

Just to exclude this as a possible cause. I once read the security help for
Win2k and follow the advise that one should use his workstation with power
user rights rather than administrator and log on as administrator only when
needed. I tried and couldn't keep it even for a day. Among other things,
xitami would behave totally out of whack when I tried to play with it logged
on as a power user account.

You don't run by any chance xitami service with other than system rights or
log on as a power user, are you?

Hope this helps

I am logging on as the user I created that is a member of the group
Administrators. So, if this is what you are considering to be a "power
user", then yes I am. You are suggesting logging in as the Administrator?

Thanks for the assistance!

If you are a member of the administrator group you should be fine. The power
users have more rights than the users but are more restricted than admins.
Anyway, are you running Xitami as an NT service? If yes, does it log on to
the local system account?

Due to the fact that many people here using the Xitami webserver are
looking for alternatives to Xitami since it no longer is a supported web
server (by the parent company iMatix), Shining Light Productions has
written a brand new web server called ProtoNova.

ProtoNova features:

  SSL/TLS support (with a simple-to-use SSL certificate generation system!)
  Normal HTTP/1.1 support
  Remote module support (moves heavy-duty processing off of the main server)
  A CGI remote module
  A LRWP remote module (allows you to directly move all current LRWP
applications to ProtoNova without recompiling!)
  A ColdFusion remote module (uses technology from XiFusion!)
  Database driven logs via ODBC (no log files!)
  Symbolic links
  Aliases
  Virtual hosting
  Multiple server support (multiple servers on multiple ports using one
application instance)
  Works "out-of-the-box"
  Secure "out-of-the-box"
  Extremely small footprint (runs on 16-32MB machines just fine...remote
modules can be used to dump the real workload onto better machines).
  ... And much, much more!


ProtoNova is a natural move from Xitami that offers server farm,
load-balancing, and clustering capabilities for a fraction of the price of
Xitami/Pro.  Also, while maintaining ease-of-use, the power of many
commercial servers can be found in simple, sensible configuration files.
Servers and virtual hosts can be brought on and offline without ever
stopping the server (the server detects the configuration change and loads
it up), which results in uptimes that can potentially exceed most (all?)
other web servers.

(Right now ProtoNova is only for Windows in a console, but eventually other
ports will become available.  The first port will be a Linux
port...probably RedHat).

For more information, visit the Shining Light Productions website:
<http://www.shininglightpro.com/index.php?treeloc=24>

Check out the ProtoNova Web Server today!


Note to XiFusion users:  XiFusion is still supported by Shining Light
Productions as it is a fairly popular freeware product.  However, the limit
to which XiFusion can be updated is quickly coming to a close (both OS and
calling process limitations are constantly arising).  Xitami is poorly
designed in the CGI arena and needs serious re-working to get rid of the
DoS/DDoS attack that still affects it.  ProtoNova is a viable alternative
that avoids the CGI DoS that plagues Xitami.  CGIs also seem to run faster
under ProtoNova...probably due to the method of handling the data pump and
having true HTTP/1.1 support.

ProtoNova is just one more way that Shining Light Productions is "Meeting

I am quite upset with the ongoing advertisements of this person on the 
xitami list the latest even for commercial products. IMHO this is  a 
violation of the commonly accepted netiquette. Therefore I suggest to the

I don't intend to do so, certainly not on the strength of a single
message.  Thomas has been very helpful to Xitami users on this list, and
with the expection of this one message all has other messages have been
about programs that work with Xitami, helping fill in the gaps between
what Xitami does and what users want to do (eg, use it with ColdFusion).

Obviously if there were continuing advertisements for a competing
webserver then it would be a cause for concern.  However a single
announcement of a new program that might be of use to users of an existing
program that isn't being updated is well within accepted netiquette
(based on a dozen or so years on the 'net).  

Thomas is right that Xitami really hasn't been maintained much (due to
lack of time) over the past few years -- IIRC the last minor update was
over a year ago, and the last major update was more than 2 years ago.

I think it is fine with me.

If I were totally uninterested, it takes only a second to hit DEL
and move to the next message.

Although Thomas is hawking his product on another product's list,
Xitami never made money for iMatix so he is hardly stealing sales.
Ewen could still decide not to allow his list-serve pennies to be
used to distribute someone else's wares; I am glad Ewen has come out
in favor of reasonable mention of related products (even when that
product might replace Ewen's product).

And Thomas has been one of the most generous and genuinely helpful
people on this list, with deep experience in Xitami and other
webserver related issues.

Personally, I have decided that when Xitami no longer does what I
need, I'll just shift to Apache. Win-Apache is now considered
"stable", or as stable as the underlying O/S; no more warnings.
However, I am about to take a good look at Thomas' product: he seems
like a good guy.

Oh, Thomas: why do you have a 650-pixel image next to a sidemenu? It
makes the page too big to read without horizontal scrolling.

All of my announcements are Xitami related.  I don't intend to advertise
ProtoNova on this list any more.  I just know that there are many users on
this list who are looking for alternative servers and I wanted to let
people know that I have an alternative server available.  I still intend on
helping people with problems with XiFusion and Xitami out and updating
XiFusion a few more times.

And sending e-mails, grabbing webpages, and otherwise simplifying life.
Life is difficult enough, why use tools that are difficult to understand
and use?

No way was I even considering that.  I realized that I would be stretching
list rules when I posted that announcement last night.  Multiple posts
would be out of line even for me.

However, I do want people to know that nothing has changed in the XiFusion
arena and is still supported.  I know it is an extremely popular product,
and there is no reason to stop supporting it nor stop updating it.

I couldn't have said it better myself.  Time is something I think every

Thomas is most welcome to announce ProtoNova on this list, although 
any extended discussion should probably move to a dedicated list. :)

Personally I welcome this announcement.  It offers Xitami users a 
choice, which is always good, and it offers Xitami some competition, 
which is good in a world where most web servers are too large and too 
complex for normal people.

I'm curious as to whether Thomas used any Xitami code in the server, 
or whether 'brand new' means written from scratch.  Thomas, you might 
want to explain your decision to start something new rather than add 
or improve the existing body of code.  Just for interest.  Also, is 
your server open source, or closed?

Then, what do you mean by 'a fraction of the price'?  Xitami/Pro is 
not expensive at $99.  Far too cheap, really, since it does not even 
start to pay its way.  What does ProtoNova cost?

Lastly, and this is for the record, Xitami *is* supported, if slowly, 
and will continue to be part of the iMatix toolset for as long as 
iMatix exists, which I intend to be a long time.  Providing open 
source products just happens to be very time consuming, and time is 
something that growing businesses are always short of.

Thomas, I think we can continue this discussion on the Xitami list 
for a little while.

Subject: [Xitami] Admin question
Message-ID: <3D486672.9060306@earthlink.net>

Let's see if I can narrow the scope of my question - because I only have 
one, and this question is the sole reason I subscribed to this list.
I need to change my admin password. According to the FAQ, all I need to 
do is change the "-" after "Admin=" to the password I want to use in the 
file "xitami.aut." I've done this, and it has no effect. I'm not trying 
to use Xitami as a web server - just using it to test CGI scripts 
locally. What can I do to fix this?
Incidentally, I understand that default passwords can cause security 
risks, but they're only a risk to people who don't remember to change 
them. If the program came with ANY password that worked, I wouldn't be 
bothering you with this question right now.

Thanks,
  - Greg

I have installed Xitami but unfortunately the FTP server will not start.
I get an error message that port 21 is already in use.
Afaik there isn't any any other server running on my pc (win 2k)
I'm using the ZA pro 3 firewall
Can there be any relation with Xitami or my firewall? Any ideas?
How can I check if port 21 is in use and which application opens it ?
Thanks,

Has anyone who is using Dynhost.com as a dynamic IP name service noticed
that it seems to have died yesterday? I've had to have my name provider
autoforward to my IP address rather than my name of lllama.dynhost.com, and
get my mail routed my HotMail account (which I can't stand.)


Any thoughts?

Let me start off by saying I agree with your opinions, portability is a must
with my apps and I probably could have gone in and changed the script as
well, but... for alot of users editing a package like Nuke this is NOT an
option (as a matter of fact some users should not even have keyboards) and
they would not have a clue on how to follow the source to fix it (or even
follow instructions). I'm not a PHP person I prefer perl for CGI so yes I
could have fumbled through it (and I did a bit) and got sick of  looking
for, at the time, the unknown.
XiFusion is a viable quick and dirty soulution for me. However if this was
Nukes authors solution to the problem then it's a poor solution.
Personally I think they could have done a few things better with Nuke, for
instance do you think requiring setting php_display_errors=Off is any
better. To me that's another mask... (Ok I know I'm going further OT here)
So XiFusion masks a problem without having to go fix someones elses mess and
I think it does a good job at it too...

I´ve solved it.
The problem is that by default there is a path named " /cgi-bin " ... it
should be just " cgi-bin " ;)

    Have you changed the path in the Xitami filters to the path where your
Perl is located alot of people have that problem.

Hi!

I´m trying to make a simple perl/cgi script work with xitami on a windows
xp.
I´ve have installed Active-perl, but when I get xitami to point it`s cgi-bin
directory to the right location of the script (actually when it points to
any directory), I can`t acces this directory through its allias "cgi-bin".
When I use the absolute name, I can, but the script doesn´t work of course
(the browser wants to download or execute the *.pl file)

Any suggestions?

Thanks:

Carlos

Subject: [Xitami] SSI & frames
Message-ID: <025601c23275$4a612c80$9865fea9@cmorelanl01>

I am re-writing my web site and I want to make it more dynamic, using Perl
scripts to build page elements. I am using frames, each frame calls a .shtml
file which simply has an <!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/blahblah.pl"-->. So far, I
have 3 frames: a top header, a left menu area, and a main area.

When I run this on my laptop using Xitami, only 2 of the 3 frames get built,
never all 3, and it sometimes varies as to which 2 get displayed. The third
frame is visually blank, and it acts as if the .shtml file did not even get
parsed as clicking 'view source' on that frame gives me the source for the
frameset (index.html). I can eliminate any one frame and the other 2 will
always load correctly.

Now, I can load the whole she-bang on my web host server (Linux/Apache, I
think) and it all works just fine. URL is http://www.thunting.com/geotech2.
Does Xitami have problems with multiple SSI calls in frames?

Also, I'm only familiar with good ol' HTML and Perl, and JavaScript to a
lesser extent. Is there a better way to dynamically build relatively simple
web pages? For some of my stuff, I will parse data files to build page
content, other times I will just write the HTML code in a Perl script, which
allows me to use config files to alter the look & feel of the entire site. I
see discussions about PHP, which I know nothing about, but I'm reluctant to
invest a lot of time learning something entirely new for such a minor
project.

Also, in making web pages fully dynamic, it would seem that web search
spiders would not be able to "look" at the content of the pages. Is this
right? Is there a simple way to deal with this?

Many thanks,
Carl
