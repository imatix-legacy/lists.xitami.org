Subject: [Xitami] perlssi not passing args?
Message-ID: <006401c26a4a$726c0080$6401a8c0@graysoftenterprises.com>

I have an EXE CGI on an html page run as an iframe.  This isn't very
effecient so I wanted to do it as an EXEC CGI but for some reason my
arguments aren't making it to the CGI.  I'm not familiar enough with perl to
tell exactly what it's doing but I do know it has code to pass args to the
QUERY_STRING environment variable, but in my EXE the variable is blank (I
have modified my EXE code to debug).  This is the syntax in my shtml file:

<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/GSEcntr.exe?code=default"-->

Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong or what I need to change or
reconfigure?  SSI and perlssi are working enough that they do run the
program but it never gets the arguments.  It worked fine as an iframe (slow
of course) so I know Xitami has no problems passing the arguments to the
program.  I can only assume the problem is in perlssi.

This works fine and isn't slow.

This returns "An internal Visual Basic error has occurred in
\default.shtml. File not found (error #53), GSECntr"

So I would say VB is getting called, but isn't getting some slice of
information.

Visual Basic is _NOT_ a good language for CGI. Oh, I've done it and
got a paycheck. But I had to study the sample VB application that
came with Xitami to find out how to get the CGI arguments and STDIN.
MS BASIC and VB really don't like to do that.

Off the top of my head: what's wrong with the iFrame version? It
isn't slow. Your site is unlikely to draw so much traffic that the
server CPU will choke. Sure it won't work in NetScape4, and there
are security flaws in IE's iFrames, but everybody else does it.

I'd also (since you seem to study programming) look to porting to
Perl or PHP. Both of these love to read STDIN. The code I wrote in
VB in a month ported to Perl in a few days and to PHP in a couple
weeks part-time. VB is a valuable skill for client-side programming,
but Perl or PHP are very valuable server-side skills.

You could easily track calf records on the server with Perl or PHP.
Then the users could access their calfbook from the house, the
(PC-equiped) barn, or out at an auction site, even on a friend's or
stranger's PC, since the records are centralized and the PC just
needs a browser interface. You probably won't want to do that,
because keeping everybody's calfbooks safe is expensive and it is
hard to collect the bills.

I got them to work

.. Now I have a question. The reason I decided against 
CGI was because of threat of DOS attack.

Instead, I communicate data via email, encrypting and Base_64'ing
the data into email body.

But I do have a need for CGI. What is the real threat with respect to CGI ??

The reason for that error output is my program relies on the argument
"code=default" to open a file (default.count) with a number in it.  I get
the file not found error because no arguments are making it to the program.
It's trying to open ".class" which doesn't exist.

It's slow because the server sends the html file to the client machine.  The
client machine reads the html and sends a request back to the server which
then executes the CGI and sends the input of the iframe back.  That is two
extra steps, which isn't too bad unless you look at it as TWICE the steps.
Just don't like inefficiency.  And I have a module that gets the STDIO just
fine (this is obvious from the working iframe).

This software isn't keeping records online, it's just a website to market a
client-side database application.  All the CGI really is is a counter I
wrote but more than anything I'm trying to get my feet wet in CGI.  I know I
can find generic counters, but the point is that this SHOULD work fine.

Surely someone out there has successfully executed a CGI with #exec cgi=""

I would probably figure out how to put the logs into a database and then
extract whatever I need from there into a temporary file, analyze it, and
delete it.  This can allow the data to be located elsewhere until needed
locally.  By doing it this way, it also allows multiple servers to use the
same storage location for easy log monitoring access.

Database logs are by far more versatile to their file-based counterparts.
Databases will also guarantee data integrity, whereas most file systems can
get corrupted (I've seen Xitami mess up the log files before due to a
server crash), good DBMS' rarely face corruption issues.

Hope this helps!

OK, I know that so much has been written about getting Perl to run under
Xitami, but I still can't get anything to run.

-- I installed perl in C:/perl directory.

-- SSI & CGI are enabled in Xitami

-- I added the following to default.cfg
[Filter]
	.pl=C:\perl\bin\perl.exe

-- The .cgi program is in the Main HTML Directory's cgi-bin directory which
is directly under the Main HTML Directory (A.K.A. root directory)

-- The calling HTML code in my page is as follows:
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">(Listings last updated on <B>
<!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/lastmod.cgi" -->
</B>)</FONT>

-- The program lastmod.cgi is as follows:
#!C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -w
#

$date = $ENV{'LAST_MODIFIED'};
$date = substr($date, 0, length($date) - 12);
print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n$date";

-- The printed results from this call are as follows:
(Listings last updated on #!C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -w # $date =
$ENV{'LAST_MODIFIED'}; $date = substr($date, 0, length($date) - 12); print
"Content-Type: text/html\n\n$date"; ) 

If I can get something as simple as this running, then I hope I can adapt
what is learned to other .cgi programs I use successfully online, as I now
do with this one.  ANY SUGGESTIONS?????  THANKS.

Normally you do NOT want to do that: put the cgi programs inside the
public HTML directory system.

The usual setup is:

Web pages: c:/xitami/webpages
CGI files: c:/xitami/cgi-bin

Try putting your PL files there, and verify that Xitami's config
knows that this folder is CGI, and that any URL with "cgi-bin" in it
should point there.

It is possible to serve CGI from anywhere. But it opens extra
security issues, and is usually not wise.

As for CGI inside SSL --- I never got that to work. Probably I am
stupid. Possibly the rules are different than when calling CGI
directly.

In DOS/Win:

copy ac020201.log + ac020301.log + ac020301.log big.log

or -

echo ac02????.log >> big.log

In Unix, replace echo with cat?

Hi All,

I am to set up an FTP account for someone, and am getting some strange
results...

I've set it up on ports 1000 and 1001, because it seems my isp blocks 21.  I
have the ports forwared through the firewall correctly.

I CAN access this myself both through my network, AND through an external
dial-up usint IE6.0 through a url like "ftp://usersname@**.***.**.***:1000"
everything works great.

the user cannot.  they say the they are asked to login, but then the
flashlight just keeps waving looking for files (the directory is empty right
now).

My logs show, alternately, 530 (login) errors and 230 (?) errors. for them

I have heard from someone else that they were able to access the pub
directory, but not this users directory from outside.

Any ideas?  Why would I be able to access this from outside and the user
not?

Thanks,

mb

Message-ID: <004d01c26c18$6a33f4c0$9f00a8c0@ziggy>

I administer a site that's running Xitami Pro, the version
released at the end of August with the SSL update.

I checked the server today after it had been up for
2 weeks, and the memory usage was up to ~70 MB in
both the Control Panel for Xitami and Task Manager.
Even so, performance did not seem to be suffering.

I restarted the service and it started off at its usual
mem alloc, but started climbing steadily and was at 8 MB
within a few hours. The site uses SSL and CGI
(windows executables, no scripts) for nearly everything.
It gets steady but not heavy usage throughout the
day.

System Info:
Windows 2000 Pro, SP3, all patches.
AMD 1.4 GHz, IDE RAID
Xitami Pro 2.4d10
  - Web only, FTP disabled
  - No virtual hosts
Connection is 392/392 SDSL

I'm thinking of running the previous version of
xipro for a few days as a test, but am wondering
if anyone has any suggestions or advice.

Message-ID: <000801c26c73$4508d200$6600a8c0@COWBOY>

Howdy All,

I'm getting the following errors in my Xitami crash log on one machine
in my basement which runs 24/7 unattended. 
The machine generates and stores log reports for a number of web sites
and Xitami is only used to view the reports. 
Therefore it may go for days without any calls to Xitami.. Then again,
sometimes Xitami runs for days with no problems. 

222mhz P2 dual processor which was running Win2k sr2 at the time of
first occurrence.

When the errors first began I was running version 2.5b5, so I backed up
to version 2.4d6 with the same results. The first several incidences
shown below repeated about 100 times a second for about 5 or 6 seconds
before it was shut down. This went on several times a day for about 2
weeks. Then I let the machine run without Xitami for a week or two. 
I believe sr3 was installed between the 1st and 2nd examples. At least
the machine now has sr3 on it. (automatic updates) The 2nd and 3rd
examples are more recent and were only repeated a few times before being
shut down. Sometimes, the internal Xitami system reports the bug and
shut itself down as I find the errors on screen. 
The silent recovery system does not recover.
Other times Windows kills the process with no Xitami error reported
either on screen or in the crash log. Any Ideas as to what is causing
this and what to do about it? 
I've run Xitami for years with no problems until about 2 months ago

howdy,

your code example is poorly chosen. The content of input.php is missing.
So, obviously, it is what it says. Undefined variable $mytext.
Either, you don't have a variable mytext in your form or you didn't assign 
a value to it.
Use
if (isset($mytext)) {print ($mytext);} else {print("OMG, I forgot to set my 
variable");}
to avoid the error.
Check input.php for existence of the variable.

BTW, courses in php basics are off topic here and should at least be marked 
as such.

regards,
tony

You do have that variable in the form.

But some versions or installations of PHP do NOT, by default, import
the HTTP variables (because they are spoofable).

I don't have my PHP manuals here to check how to handle that. But
I'm sure you can find it.

When using PHP, you DO NOT have to set variables before use. The Notice
simply means you are refering to an empty variable... it is not a fail
critical thing. If it does stop the PHP script working, then thats your
php.ini and not the server

Subject: [Xitami] FTP / NAT issues - is ISS better?
Message-ID: <F45LgDxyKOHRGq6EvhH00000d64@hotmail.com>

I am running the latest release of Xitami Win2000 Server.  I am initiating 
the FTP services with default settings, Port 21 and the same server IP.  
When I connect to the FTP server from my location, I get connected but I 
can't see any files or directories.

My work location is not firewalled but NAT is being applied from my client 
side.  I see the connection, but the server isn't returning basic directory 
listings or file listings.  When I shut down the Xitami FTP service on the 
server and then initiate IIS FTP service, I can FTP just fine.

For some reason it seems Xitami can't communicate back to the NAT port my 
computer is coming through.  But the IIS FTP service can.  Whats up with 
that?  Anyone have any insights?

Message-ID: <MABBILGNLFGMJIPJLFFKMEIBCBAA.bronder@attbi.com>

I'm having ftp problems myself, but of a different nature.

What I noticed on Xitami, is that you need to have 2 ports open 20 (for the
Data Connection Port) and 21 are the default.  I switched to ports 1000 and
1001 because i thought my ISP might have been blocking port 21.

I am able to get to my ftp sites through computers on the network, but am
having very inconsistent results from outside my network that I haven't been
able to resolve yet.

Someone earlier wisely suggested forcing the IE ftp service to passive mode
through the tools/internet options menu.

fwiw, I'm considering switching to Apache or IIS because of this and other
issues I've had with X flaking out and crashing, but have significant
inertia working against that move.

Well, I still haven't received any answers on this.  I can't imagine I am 
the first one to experience these symtoms.

Xitami FTP doesn't handle client NAT very well, but ISS FTP service does.  
Anyway to fix this or anyone have a solution?

Hi,

Has anyone noticed X flaking out while running the p2p file sharing program
kazaa?

X had been stable on my XP machine for some time, but has only recently
started crashing.  The only other change I've made has been to change the
ftp ports...

Thanks

Kazza at times can put a "very" heavy load on the system taking nearly all the cpu time.  
The current Xitami seems to have a greater chance of crashing with a heavy load.  They 
are looking for a good test case to recreate the error often enough to fix it.  If you run 
across one let em know.

Don't use Xitami's FTP if it gives you any trouble. It's just a free
bonus in a free program. It's worth more than nothing, but is just
basic simple FTP. It hasn't been looked at since home-NAT became
common.

Don't use IIS _PERIOD_. Aside from being bug-bait, it likes to leave
bits of itself behind even when you think you've removed it. Maybe
it's what's blocking X's FTP.

There are a zillion cheap and free FTP servers. A dozen of them are
good. War FTP seems popular. Maybe someone will pop in with one they
like better.

It looks legal; I don't see anything that should be a problem.

Don't use spaces in filenames or folder names on the Web (or FTP).
They often work, probably should work if encoding is done right. But
sometimes it does not work, for some clients, and you can't figure
out why.

The only site I have seen for the Sokrates is http://www.conacom.de/
Is this correct ?
They are Deutsch only ?  No English ?
I saw no mention of "Zero Toaster"

Are you saying that Sokrates is no longer supported on Xitami ?

Thanks in advance for your responses.

Subject: [Xitami] FTP / NAT issues - is ISS better?
Message-ID: <F140Y30kkZIhTrBoe2U000002fd@hotmail.com>

Thanx for the responses guys, was starting to feel like I had discovered 
some new major bug that no one had done before.  Makes a lot of sense now.  
I am going to look into another FTP service just so I can got off of 
Microshits IIS.

However, I know that the Xitami server is free as well as its bundled FTP 
service, but I think that some more development should start being applied 
to the FTP side.  It would be nice to have a complete package with one 
Xitami load.

Is there anything us Joe users can do to help develop or push the 
development of a more robust FTP Server?  The foundation is already there.

Thanx, I have found this out the hard way, doing tests the last 48 hours.  I 
just posted another response to this topic concerning further development of 
the Xitami FTP service.  take a look at it and tell me what you think.

I am also looking into another FTP service in the mean time.  IIS was 
quickly available to test with but is not my long term solution.

I received a response from Bernd and he said that Sokrates will still be
supported and updated, but I am not sure how long that will last.  Bernd,
could you clarify this issue for the list?

Well, I hope they keep it around. I was starting this part
of the project soon, and I was likely going to move from PHP to Sokrates.
I do like the idea of Java Servlets. 

Thanks for responding Thomas.

[snip further examples of the occurrence of "3D"]

The above stems from someone having used "quoted-printable" format when
making a posting, and for the archiving software being ignorant of this
format, and including the content verbatim.

Quoted-printable is sometimes used by some mailers when a character is
required in the text that is not "seven-bit clean" (the relevant
standards for e-mail on the Internet explicitly state that the content of
messages shall consist ONLY of the characters in the SEVEN-bit ASCII
character set, although extensions exist to handle, e.g., characters with
the eighth bit set high).  One of these extension mechanisms is the very
crude quoted-printable format; use of this format is generally
deprecated.

So such characters are sent by their equivalent hexadecimal code for the
two nibbles in the octet, preceded by an equals sign.  Thus the code for
the British "pound sign" might appear as =A3, since this character has
the code 0xA3 (or 163 in decimal)[1].  Since the equals character is
hijacked under this mechanism to introduce such triglyph codes for a
single character, then occurrences of the equals sign itself will appear
encoded, as =3D, since 0x3d or decimal 61 is the ASCII code for the
equals sign.  (Messages in quoted-printable will sometimes also have =20
appearing at the ends of lines, to indicate that there is actually a
space character present there before the end-of-line.)

You'll note that this mail does NOT have the requisite MIME header to
indicate that quoted-printable characters appear herein, and therefore
everyone's mail-readers /ought/ to see the actual triglyph sequences
themselves, rather than the character which each sequence represents.

[1] Well, that's the code in a widely-used codepage associated with
Windows Latin-1 alphabet.  For those of us that use CP437 or CP850, we
see a lowercase-letter-u-with-acute-accent, but that's just another of
the vagaries of Windows software assuming that everyone is using it, and
not including the other requisite headers to permit of automatic
translation at the recipent's computer.

As I was the original poster of the script example which included the
"3D"'s, I am very interested in this explanation. At the time, I thought the
spurious characters had something to do with me posting in HTML. Long after
the original incident, I discovered that all the example files from the
original source were riddled with "solid black rectangle characters" (when
viewed in Notepad) which had to be removed before the examples were usable
in a Win 2000 environment.
I suspect the mysterious appearance of the "3D"'s in my post and the
rectangles in the original files are related somehow. The files came
originally from a Perl book author's web site, and (I believe) were designed
to be run on a Unix-based web server. Subsequent to all this, I have
discovered that many other Perl authors provide separate script file
downloads for Windows vs. Unix. When I use example scripts designated for
Windows, I have no problems.
A colleague and I have discovered that if the original files are run through
a utility called Unix2DOS.com, then reversed through DOS2Unix.com, then
reversed through Unix2DOS.com *again*, the offending characters are finally
eradicated and the files are usable. I have also discovered that if these
original files are opened in WordPad, then saved with File->SaveAs to force
an overwrite, the resulting file is "cleansed" and usable on a Windows-based
web server.
I am relating all this in hopes of getting some practical insight on how the
files' originator (the book author) could have avoided all this in the first
place, as she appears to be as mystified by all this as I am. Should this
author be offering two sets of files, one for Windows-based web servers, and
the other for Unix-based web servers? Is there a better way?

Can I have a look at the original files?  Just send them to me off-list (I
only just started looking at this thread since I have only recently run
into problems like this).  I want to examine and see what problems there
are contained within.  If you want to, I would also like to see the
"cleansed" versions as well.  I will be able to provide a much better
explanation if I have the original files than if I did not.

Hope this helps!

Yes.  [I'm not too sure that DOS permits spaces around the plus-signs,
however; I've certainly never used them.]

Errm, the above will append the string of characters "ac02????.log" to
the file big.log (creating the latter if it doesn't already exist).

I suspect that you might have wanted to suggest
> type ac02????.log >> big.log
which would output each log file to stdout, which is redirected to append
to big.log.

However, that is not possible: remember that DOS/Windoze does all file
globbing IN the applications, and that the TYPE command is not written to
perform wildcard expansion.

However, all is not lost: DOS possesses a FOR command, so the original
poster could try:
> for %f in (ac02????.log) do type %f >> big.log
which will concatenate all the files into big.log.  However, there is no
guarantee that they will be in any particular order: DOS will get them in
whatever order they have been fitted into empty slots in the directory
structure.  So it might be necessary instead to write:
> for %f in (ac020101 ac020201 ac020301) do type %f.log >> big.log
if the order is important to the analysis.

> In Unix, replace echo with cat?

Errm, yes.  The files will appear in the "correct" order.

Has anyone out there ever run into any trouble running Xitami on a Windows
XP system? I've found that on my system, I can visit the web server, but I
can't log on to FTP. I've tried runnning Xitami on a non-XP machine with the
same config files, and everything works fine. Is there a patch or something
I'm missing?

I had very inconsistent results with Xitami's ftp 
server, and there's been a short string of questions 
about it lately culminating, essentially, in the 
statement from someone wiser then I that X's ftp server 
is an afterthought built on top of a free http server.  
Don't count on it being anything great.

There are other decent ftp servers out there that run 
along side X... WarFTP and Argosoft are popular.

If you know much about PHP, read below. Else wise, ignore this and go have a
cup of nice hot tea/coffee :-)

The problem is my sessions don't work properly... the ID is stored and saved
in the cookie fine, and the PHP script can even acces the Session ID value
in the cookie. However, when you call session_start(); it mearly creates a
new session/session ID instead of resuming.
I can pass on the session id using
$target = "http://url.com?".CID;
header( "Location: $target" );
but obviously doing that is not what I want to do for every page/link. I
wrote a script to test the session function. The sessions are set in a
script using session_register() and the variables are stored perfectly fine
in the session folder, even the session ID's match with the output of CID.

The Code:
print "Session ID = ".session_id()."<br>";
print "Searching for cookie ID ( $_ENV[COOKIE] ) <br>";

Firstly, I called the code before session_start(); just to see what happens.
It returns:

Session ID =
Searching for cookie ID ( PHPSESSID=7c7b9b50c724fc18c59c436d78b4992d )

Remember, thats before I call session_start();
However, Exactly the same code used after session_start(); returns something
different...

Session ID = e6c9f37a45808b552b8f04ee06968d42
Searching for cookie ID ( PHPSESSID=7c7b9b50c724fc18c59c436d78b4992d )

So, as you can see, Session_Start(); has actually started a NEW session
rather than the old session refered to in the session cookie. This is most
annoying... and I have no idea what could be causing it.

Thank you for your time. I hope I have explained it fairly well...

I've had the reverse experience.  A user tried to connect via FTP from a Windows
XP Pro computer and no FTP client or setting tried got the connection working.
I would normally be looking at the user's ISP for FTP blocking or firewall
problems, but when the user reverted to W2K FTP connected without a problem.

There are some strange things in XP.

Hi all,

You know, there's a built-in firewall in XP... Before looking any further, 
I'd make sure it's properly configured to let FTP through (or use FTP in 
passive mode).

My 2 cents.
Fabien.

The following are some cut/pasted threads that concern the Xitami FTP 
service.....essentially, it sucks!  Very unfortunate too.  The Xitami FTP 
service has problems with NAT, Passive Mode, Proxy and connections from 
WinXP.  Obviously, all the development went into the kick-ass web service 
and zero development went into the sucky-ass FTP service.

The first one is my inital posting, and the rest are responses to that 
initail posting.  Take from it what you will:

===========================================================
I am running the latest release of Xitami Win2000 Server.  I am initiating
the FTP services with default settings, Port 21 and the same server IP.
When I connect to the FTP server from my location, I get connected but I
can't see any files or directories.

My work location is not firewalled but NAT is being applied from my client
side.  I see the connection, but the server isn't returning basic directory
listings or file listings.  When I shut down the Xitami FTP service on the
server and then initiate IIS FTP service, I can FTP just fine.

For some reason it seems Xitami can't communicate back to the NAT port my
computer is coming through.  But the IIS FTP service can.  Whats up with
that?  Anyone have any insights?

-R
===============================================
Don't use Xitami's FTP if it gives you any trouble. It's just a free
bonus in a free program. It's worth more than nothing, but is just
basic simple FTP. It hasn't been looked at since home-NAT became
common.

Don't use IIS _PERIOD_. Aside from being bug-bait, it likes to leave
bits of itself behind even when you think you've removed it. Maybe
it's what's blocking X's FTP.

There are a zillion cheap and free FTP servers. A dozen of them are
good. War FTP seems popular. Maybe someone will pop in with one they
like better.

-PRR
===============================================
I'm having ftp problems myself, but of a different nature.

What I noticed on Xitami, is that you need to have 2 ports open 20 (for the
Data Connection Port) and 21 are the default.  I switched to ports 1000 and
1001 because i thought my ISP might have been blocking port 21.

I am able to get to my ftp sites through computers on the network, but am
having very inconsistent results from outside my network that I haven't been
able to resolve yet.

Someone earlier wisely suggested forcing the IE ftp service to passive mode
through the tools/internet options menu.

fwiw, I'm considering switching to Apache or IIS because of this and other
issues I've had with X flaking out and crashing, but have significant
inertia working against that move.

mb
==================================================
Just so you do not think you are alone, I have the same problem - but
mine started when I added a router into the mix that uses NAT.  Prior to
that I used a software internet sharing package that worked fine.

I have found no solution so far.  I think the problem may be in FTP
wanting at least two ports, but why the software sharing handled it I do
not know.

I have been patiently (and unsuccessfully) waiting for responses to your
submissions.  I will copy Ewen in case he has ideas or the time to
respond.

I have used sessions with Xitami without any problems. Since you can see the
session cookie value it would appear that Xitami and the browser are doing their
job, so you would appear to have a PHP or coding problem.

I have always named my sessions, never used the default session name. It would
appear that although you have a cookie named PHPSESSID session_start() isn't
using 'PHPSESSID' for it's session name. Try using the function

     session_name('YOUR_SESSSION_NAME');      // make up your own session name
obviously

before each call to session_start() to force your own session cookie name.

Best of luck, Paul

Strange, I connect via FTP probably 6 or 7 times a day, 5 days a week on
this computer (my XP work computer - while having 10-20 apps open when doing
it).  So it must have been something else.  I think XP has a built-in
firewall service (if I remember correctly), I never enabled mine, but it
might have been that.

The problem isn't if XP can support NAT or Passive Mode....its if Xitami 
can...and as of now, Xitami does an extremely poor job, if at all, of 
supporingt either.  I run Xitami on Win2k and I can't connect to the FTP 
service if my client is coming through a NAT connection, passive mode or 
not.

My 3 cents.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami and MySQL
Message-ID: <3DAE0803.7010605@attbi.com>

Hi,

I'm attempting to setup a web site with Xitami and MySQL on a Windows XP 
machine.  The web server serves static and dynamic content properly and 
I'm able to connect to the MySQL server via the command line and execute 
queries.  I'm also able to connect to the database and execute queries 
programmatically via Perl/DBI run from the command line.  However, I'm 
unable to connect to from a CGI process, using the same connect string 
that works from the Perl command line; in fact, it's the same code. 
Here's the errror I get back from DBI:

DBI->connect(my_database) failed: Can't create IP socket (10106) at 
c:/.../foo.pl line 15

The only difference here is that I'm trying to connect from a CGI 
process rather than a non-CGI process.

I'm stumped.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Todd

Thanks for all the help, folks. It turns out the firewall was down to begin
with, so it looks like it's time to hit Google for some alternate solutions.
Either that or hit the server with a hammer. I'll decide later.

Todd are you running this on a multi user system or is this just a single
admin system once you create a user in XP it changes things a bit I had
problems also until I just deleted the users and just left it an admin
system I suppose one of these day's I ought to figure out what I need to do
to get it all running

drop a line here when you get is figured out :)

have fun I am

Try www.TinySoftware.com for a firewall.

If XP has permissions like NT, be sure the permissions are set
for the folders involved.

In the next update it would be nice if Xitami gave these (and 
similar) mischevious entries a 404 instead of a 200.   Harmless to be 
sure but it's never comfortable seeing 200 in the log.

Works great, because it's just another file for Xitami
to serve.

For example, create a folder named "stylesheets" just
below your webroot, then put this in the header of
pages that use the stylesheet:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/stylesheets/yourstyles.css">
...
...
</head>

Put the appropriate CSS stuff in "yourstyles.css" and
that's all there is to it.

Hi, I'm having a problem with virtual hosts. Some are working, others
are not. For the ones that are not working, I recieve the "base" host's
web-pages. Here is my defaults.cfg file:

[Ftp]
    Hard-quota = "25"
    Soft-quota = "20"

[Security]
    Filename = "defaults.aut"

[Server]
    Cgi-bin = "/var/www/cgi-bin"
    Default1 = "index.html"
    Default2 = "default.html"

[Virtual-hosts]
    Www.der-liebe-josef.de = "der-liebe-josef_de.cfg"
    Www.beratermarktplatz.de = "beratermarktplatz_de.cfg"
    Www.familie-ney.de = "familie-ney.cfg"
    Www.infolayer.com = "infolayer_com.cfg"
    Www.infolayer.net = "infolayer_net.cfg"


And here is the "beratermarktplatz_de.cfg" file:

[Accesslog]
    Filename = "beratermarktplatz_de.log"

[Security]
    Filename = "beratermarktplatz_de.aut"

[Server]
    Cgi-bin = "/var/www/cgi-bin"
    Default1 = "index.html"
    Default2 = "default.html"
    Webpages = "/var/www/html/beratermarktplatz_de"

[Wsx]
    Admin = ""
    Setup = ""

So any idea what the problem is? Robert

Have you actaully definded the virtual hosts?

IE: Have you got a file called 'der-liebe-josef_de.cfg' and is it set to
access a different directory than your default file?

I believe there is an option in the Xitami config called 'Virtual Hosts' on
the main screen which allows you to set individual settings for each Virtual
Host. The layout is the same for defaults.

Yes you do. Its the same with all your server settings, you should always
restart the server for the settings to take effect.

You should not have to. Xitami is supposed to see that the files
have changed and re-read them.

That actually works for some things, but usually not for the vHost
changes. I usually have to re-start.

Hmm... I thought Xitami will reload the config files every minute or so
and than use the new configs. This is not the case? Robert

  Hello everyone,

  Have any of you ever noticed whether or not your connections counter for

connection as more than one.  I think whenever I click on my site, it 
registers me as 4 connections, but I can't be for sure! I just wondered if

Web browsers make more than 1 connection, regardless of the type of browser.
You can control this if you make changes to the registry. You can have as
little as 2 or up to 20 connections. More connections with a fast Internet
connection means pages load really fast. The difference is not that
noticeable with dialup.

I believe X-Tech Setup (a tweak program) gives you the ability to change the
settings.

Anyway, the counter counts http connections, not internet connections... if
that makes sense.

Are you using explorer as a browser ? If you have a personal firewall running on
a workstation
and type in a url that contains images or frames you will see that explorer
creates multiple threads
and connections to download the different portions of the page content.

Don't know, but this might be what you are seeing

Well, it works sometimes and not other times and also depends on what
version of Xitami the OP is running.  For basically every change I have
ever made under 2.4d9, I have had to completely shutdown the server and
restart it...after a solid round of tweaking it gets annoying.

Hope this helps!

When a "page" is multiple files (text plus images), early NetScape
opened up to 4 connections to try to load files in parallel. On
dial-up this gives a little more speed; it can be significant on
fast wires. Later browsers may have a setting (albeit buried deep)
to change this number. In a few old situations, 2 or even 1 might
cause less congestion in a fragile TCP stack. On good machinery, 10
or more might shave milliSeconds for total page-load time.

While we are on the subject, I never thought it was of much use because when
I pull it up it just shows the connections for localhost, is that what is
suppose to come up? It does show connections but I don't know for what site.

Subject: [Xitami] Trouble with Filters and Aliases
Message-ID: <F1431m7YDopT5kZ1pvH000057b3@hotmail.com>

I'm using Xitami 2.5b5 for Windows (2000 Professional, sp2) with PHP 4.2.2, 
and I've come across a problem combining the PHP filter with aliases:

- PHP files accessible via the standard document root (in my case, 
'd:/inet/web/server') work perfectly through the the filter ('.php = 
d:/apps/inet/php/php.exe'); for example:
'/index.php' -> 'd:/inet/web/server/index.php' works
'/dir/index.php' -> 'd:/inet/web/server/dir/index.php' works

- HTML files accessible via an alias ('private = d:/inet/web/secure') also 
work perfectly; for example:
'/private/index.html' -> 'd:/inet/web/secure/index.html' works,
'/private/dir/index.html' -> 'd:/inet/web/secure/dir/index.html' works

- PHP files accessible via an alias come back empty; for example:
'/private/test.php' -> 'd:/inet/web/secure/test.php' doesn't work, I just 
get an empty template document.

The problem appears to be related specifically to the situation in which a 
filtered file extension is accessed after an alias translation.  I 
downloaded the Xitami source kit and attempted to locate the bug myself, but 
quickly discovered that it's more elusive than I expected (although there is 
a comment which indicates that the developers are aware that filters and 
aliases don't work together); I set some breakpoints and determined that the 
temporary file ('pipeXXXX.flt') was, in fact, being generated in my system 
temp folder with the correctly parsed PHP output, but somehow this file is 
not being returned by the server; instead I only get:<pre>

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<META http-equiv=Content-Type content="text/html; 
charset=windows-1252"></HEAD>
<BODY></BODY></HTML>

</pre>
I searched Googol for information and found some other people who had the 
same trouble, but I can think of no workaround until the developers address 
the issue specifically.

Any suggestions, or should I go ahead and email the bug to iMatix?

Ok, thanks for the info. I restarted the server and everything works
now. A bit confusing as the docs state it will do an automatic reload...
Anyway, I finally made it. Thanks to all. Robert

I'm having problems with reverse DNS lookup.

Xitami only uses the IP adress in my logfiles.
I have two working DNS servers in the "defaults.cfg"

---------
[Rdns]
    Debug = "1"
    Primary-server = "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
    Secondary-server = "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
---------

My server is connected to the Internet via a DSL line. Is there a port#
in the router firewall that must be opened for this to work ?

And I'm still looking for the Debug output (does anyone know where it
goes?)

I keep getting the next message when trying to run a php application.
I've been through all the settings at least ten times, I just can't find the
answer..

Security Alert! The PHP CGI cannot be accessed directly.
This PHP CGI binary was compiled with force-cgi-redirect enabled. This means
that a page will only be served up if the REDIRECT_STATUS CGI variable is
set, e.g. via an Apache Action directive.

For more information as to why this behaviour exists, see the manual page
for CGI security.

For more information about changing this behaviour or re-enabling this
webserver, consult the installation file that came with this distribution,
or visit the manual page.

This means

in your PHP.INI file you need to set this
; cgi.force_redirect is necessary to provide security running PHP as a CGI
under
; most web servers.  Left undefined, PHP turns this on by default.  You can
; turn it off here AT YOUR OWN RISK
; **You CAN safely turn this off for IIS, in fact, you MUST.**
cgi.force_redirect = 0


hope that helps

Subject: [Xitami] Administration: old mailing list messages
Message-ID: <20021028195942.3C39DADFC6@basilica.la.naos.co.nz>

Hi Folks,

I've discovered a bunch of Xitami mailing list messages that got stuck
in a time warp (to be technical: they needed approval, and for reasons
I'm still investigating no one was prompted to approve them).  I've
deleted some of the old one liner messages ("thanks, I'll try that" and
the like), and will approve the rest.

So please don't panic when seemingly quite old messages start appearing
on the list.

Heya folks. For some reason I seem to have an upload cap on my computer. The
fastest anyone can download a file from me is 11KB/s. I have Xitami v2.4d9
and am running it on Windows XP. Also have a router between the cable modem
and my computer. If you guys can offer and suggestions as to what might be
causing this and how I can fix it I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

As I was the original poster of the script example which included the
"3D"'s, I am very interested in this explanation. At the time, I thought the
spurious characters had something to do with me posting in HTML. Long after
the original incident, I discovered that all the example files from the
original source were riddled with "solid black rectangle characters" (when
viewed in Notepad) which had to be removed before the examples were usable
in a Win 2000 environment.
I suspect the mysterious appearance of the "3D"'s in my post and the
rectangles in the original files are related somehow. The files came
originally from a Perl book author's web site, and (I believe) were designed
to be run on a Unix-based web server. Subsequent to all this, I have
discovered that many other Perl authors provide separate script file
downloads for Windows vs. Unix. When I use example scripts designated for
Windows, I have no problems.
A colleague and I have discovered that if the original files are run through
a utility called Unix2DOS.com, then reversed through DOS2Unix.com, then
reversed through Unix2DOS.com *again*, the offending characters are finally
eradicated and the files are usable. I have also discovered that if these
original files are opened in WordPad, then saved with File->SaveAs to force
an overwrite, the resulting file is "cleansed" and usable on a Windows-based
web server.
I am relating all this in hopes of getting some practical insight on how the
files' originator (the book author) could have avoided all this in the first
place, as she appears to be as mystified by all this as I am. Should this
author be offering two sets of files, one for Windows-based web servers, and
the other for Unix-based web servers? Is there a better way?

I'm not sure what you mean by 'admin system'.  I'm the only user. 
 Anyway, I fixed the problem with something called, Apache.  ;^)

Thanks anyway.

I'll second a vote of confidence in War FTPd. It has worked great for us - even

I don't know if this was answered.

If PHP's register globals is off (now the default), the link you used can
only be called from within PHP. This is to prevent PHP variable pollution.
If you must have this type of link called from outside PHP, you have to go
into the php.ini file and turn register globals on. I highly recommend you
read about "register globals" on the PHP website.

Unless you have glabal variables ON in your php.ini file (a bad idea), you 
need to bring the fields after the "?" into the url into your php code with:

$phpfirstname=$_REQUEST["firstname"];

(or similar, depending upon your configuration / version - it's in the php 
manual).

This is pure file system differences from *NIX to DOS...
Files on *NIX based systems terminate lines with a LF Dec(10) on DOS/Windows
based systems line terminators are expected to be CR/LF Dec(13)/Dec(10).
Notepade shows a single LF not paired with a CR as the little square you
indicate.
The solutions you have mentioned are what is available. Should the author be
including 2 sets of files. I don't see why... A mention of it may be nice
for a newbie but this is something many of us deal with each and every
day...

Hope this is of any help...

Converting files from Unix to DOS format is easy for us seasoned
professionals (yeah, right).

I found that UltraEdit (at ultraedit.com) have conversion utility built in.
I'm sure there are other, free, text editor that do also.

It should never require more than one conversion.

You can technically use either the NT or the Win9x version on an XP system.
But, there is one thing you need to know...XP and the Xitami FTP functions
don't work well together. You're going to want to find a separate FTP Server
software to make up for it. I had good luck with
http://www.pablovandermeer.nl/ftp_server.html It's small, it's free, it's
easy to use and it comes with the source code.

Hope that helps!

Looking at that mess that Oracle wants you to set, I think you would
be best-off running Apache. (Or smacking some common sense into
Oracle, but that won't happen.)

Yes, the aliases probably map to Xitami aliases, but they are prone
to not work right when things get complicated.

SetEnv you could do just by starting Xitami from a BAT file that
sets environment variables, or with NT's global or user
environments.

SetEnvIf.... I wonder if you take out the if and set that/those
variables globally, will it work? Or did Oracle really get so messy
that it needs someone else (the webserver) to tell it where it is,
differently for different requests?

It is perfectly possible to run Xitami on port 80 and Apache on
another port on the same machine. I have two machines here working
that way. IMHO a better plan would be to run them on separate
machines.

    Default2=index.html
    Webpages=C:\Websites\

How come I can't access those two sites by: Http://127.0.0.1/gsinc or
http://127.0.0.1/mxc ?

I'd appreiate any help,

Create a host name in your "hosts" file that translates to 127.0.0.1 and use
that instead. It should work.

Subject: [Xitami] Alias not working?
Message-ID: <F1563fuHhj64bCJl0RF00006750@hotmail.com>

For the aliased sites in question, try renaming the index.php file and 
adding an index.html with some filler comment in it - I bet the alias will 
start working, and you'll get your filler html file.  If so, I think you're 
running into the same problem I did - I actually posted this to the list 
about a week ago, but nobody ever replied.

There appears to be a bug in Xitami that causes aliases and filters to 
conflict - I also use PHP and tried to set up some aliases, and found that 
when I accessed a php file via the normal document root it would work, and 
when I accessed an html file through an alias it would work, but when I 
tried to access a php file through an alias, it would return nothing.

I downloaded the source package but was unable to fully isolate the bug - 
all I know is that filters create temporary pipe????.flt files in your 
system temp folder which contain the parsed output to send to the client, 
and in the alias case, this file remains empty after the filter program was 
called.

Interestingly enough, there is actually a comment in the source code in the 
module that sets up filter-handling that says it doesn't take aliases into 
account - it would seem the designers already know this is a problem, and 
just haven't gotten around to fixing it.  So, my advice is to email Xitami's 
bug report address and ask them to.

Comment: It looks correct doesn't it

URL: mxc/
Result: C:/Websites/TransCan/local_website/www_mxc

The same thing happens if I change the lines in the default file to:
[Alias]
    gsinc=C:\Websites\New GrainStoves
    mxc=C:\Websites\TransCan\local_website\www_mxc

Do you mean an entry like this:
127.0.0.1 www.MyName.com
or
127.0.0.1 localhostagain

I'm still trying to figure this out,

Hi folks,

I'm doing a lot of web development and would like to access any of my sites
without having to change the default path setting everytime. I'm trying to
use the ALIAS  settings to allow me this feature.

Here is what I have in defaults.cfg:
[Alias]
    /gsinc/=C:\Websites\New GrainStoves
    /mxc/=C:\Websites\TransCan\local_website\www_mxc

[Filter]
    .php=C:\PHP\php.exe

[Security]
    Filename=defaults.aut

[Server]
    Debug=1
    Default1=index.php
    Default2=index.html
    Webpages=C:\Websites\

How come I can't access those two sites by: Http://127.0.0.1/gsinc or
http://127.0.0.1/mxc ?

I'd appreiate any help,
Thanks,
James

For the aliased sites in question, try renaming the index.php file and
adding an index.html with some filler comment in it - I bet the alias will
start working, and you'll get your filler html file.  If so, I think you're
running into the same problem I did - I actually posted this to the list
about a week ago, but nobody ever replied.

There appears to be a bug in Xitami that causes aliases and filters to
conflict - I also use PHP and tried to set up some aliases, and found that
when I accessed a php file via the normal document root it would work, and
when I accessed an html file through an alias it would work, but when I
tried to access a php file through an alias, it would return nothing.

I downloaded the source package but was unable to fully isolate the bug -
all I know is that filters create temporary pipe????.flt files in your
system temp folder which contain the parsed output to send to the client,
and in the alias case, this file remains empty after the filter program was
called.

Interestingly enough, there is actually a comment in the source code in the
module that sets up filter-handling that says it doesn't take aliases into
account - it would seem the designers already know this is a problem, and
just haven't gotten around to fixing it.  So, my advice is to email Xitami's
bug report address and ask them to.

Alex

I just ran into this problem myself a week ago.  When the next version of
XiFusion comes out, it will correct the problem that you are having with
PHP (PHP works fine locally here with aliases, but I need to make sure the
software does not have any bugs in it).  XiFusion is probably not a good
long-term solution, but it does provide a quick-fix for many things that
Xitami does not do correctly.

I've checked these settings and I think they are correct, maybe they aren't
but I've lost it then. I've looked up this problem on several sites and all
say the same thing about the variable so I've set that to 0. I've also tried
it with both the enviroment stting through the autoexec.
Neither option makes any difference.
The filters have been set correctly in both the base and the specific host
settings, it's got me stumped.
I could include the files but I don't want to mess up the list to much.
Any ideas?

This means
that a page will only be served up if the REDIRECT_STATUS CGI variable is
set, e.g. via an Apache Action directive.

in your PHP.INI file you need to set this
; cgi.force_redirect is necessary to provide security running PHP as a CGI
under
; most web servers.  Left undefined, PHP turns this on by default.  You can
; turn it off here AT YOUR OWN RISK
; **You CAN safely turn this off for IIS, in fact, you MUST.**
cgi.force_redirect = 0


hope that helps

I don't have the answer to your problem as I 
have run into the same situation. But FYI, I 
_don't_ get that message when accessing a .php 
file that is not directly under the doc root 
directory ( in /subdirectoryname). It works fine 
there. I also do not get the warning when 
accessing my site by IP address.It works fine in 
the doc root when accessed by IP address. I have 
no explanation but only pass along the 
observations.      --gerry

Ok, this is probably a dumb question but I don't have time to look into it 
so I am looking for a quick answer.  I have a client that I am getting ready 
to host their domain for.  He wants to know if my server can support Front 
Page extensions.

Does that require I install anything onto my server?  I have never worked 
with Front Page before.  If I do need to do something can someone let me 
know the steps/software/process involved in order to get it working.

Thanx

 I didn't do anything different to use FP to build sites hosted at my house
using xitami.  Not sure if there would be anything different with FP and a
remote user.  I remember long ago when I want to use FP to build a site on
my old ISP's server, they wouldn't set it up for me unless I payed for
"comercial" account.

I think the point of the last post was that Xitami does
not support Front Page Extensions, and hence this
is not the place to look for answers -- because you
will need to run a different Web Server (IIS or Apache)
in order to support FPE.

hi,

I am using LRWP with delphi. I had to customize (hack) one of the existent

was too lazy to use the socket api directly. I remember that there was a
problem with the read/write events not working well. I never tried with
TTCPClient but is it possible that you encountered the same problem?

Sure. FP is capable of emitting 99%-good simple HTML.

BUT.... FP is -also- capable of sticking in Forms, Administration,
Hitcounters, Multi-user Authoring, Chat, and who know what else
features that will not work unless Front Page Extensions are loaded
on the server. Hey, they have to do something to buck Apache!

See http://office.microsoft.com/assistance/9798/hostingfaq.aspx

This is, as RO guessed, a set of CGI-like programs. (However MS
hates to do CGI, preferring their own proprietary code tricks. They
use "the Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI),
the near-universal Web server extension mechanism." I would not call
it "near-universal" at all... does anybody but MS and their
supporters use ISAPI?)

I may have been a bit hasty. There are FP Extensions for unix
servers. Specific servers on specific unixes. These do use the CGI
interface. It might be possible to hack one of those into working
with Xitami.

And isn't there a product to support ISAPI on Xitami? Seems to me
I've seen that. And ignored it, because ISAPI looks like a bad idea
to me, and bug-bait too.

As a "quick answer", I still think "No" is correct for FP Extensions
on Xitami.

Subject: [Xitami] Web Admin per virtual domains...
Message-ID: <F91VHvLI6VLDZNTGgEk0000d04b@hotmail.com>

I have several virtual domains set up and on each one of them I have allowed 
web-based administration for each domain's admin.  However, I am having some 
serious problems accessing the admin sections of the domains.

Problem 1:
I login as Superuser to the default domain and verify virtual domain 
"blah.com" has "Web Based Admin" checked in its Security section.  I confirm 
the blah.aut file has the /admin=HELLO password set.  The alias is pointing 
to: /admin = /xitami/blah/htdocs/admin.  The Superuser field for domain 
blah.com is empty.

* I then open a new browser and connect to: www.blah.com/admin
* It asks for user name and password, I enter: admin , HELLO.
* It then gives me the FULL Superuser access to every virtual domain on the 
server.  From the blah.com admin login I can control and change and edit 
info for every other domain.

Is this a BUG?  Or am I doing something wrong?

Problem 2:
I believe this is a problem relating to the first one above.  If I define a 
FTP user for the default domain that user shows up in ALL the password FTP 
password sections for all the other Virtual domains.

Default domain FTP login: User: jdoe  Pass: hello  Path: /

Then under virtual domain blah.com I go to add FTP users and the account I 
just defined for "jdoe" above is now present in the Blah.com FTP password 
file.  Whats up with that?

Please help, this has been driving me nuts for along time.

Deault settings over-ride all your sub-settings in each of the virtual hosts
(I believe anyway). For example, when I turned off CGI in the default
settings, it completely disabled the entire GDI mechanism!

Oh well...
