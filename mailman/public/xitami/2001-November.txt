Hi Priyo,

any script will work provided that you have installed the correct 
interpreter with Xitami.
There are tons of scripts written in either perl or php. I cannot tell you 
good places for download but they are easily found in any search engine.

good luck,

Hugo

Message-ID: <3BE10769.B4694E8E@sovik.no>

I'm having some troubles getting Xitami 'watertight'.

There is a little thing I have found out. Xitami is returning 2
different errors when trying to get files from areas where the user
shouldn't have access to.

When the file exists, it returns:
    403 forbidden

When it doesn't exist, it returns:
    404 not found

It would be better if it just returned '403 forbidden', else I could
write a program to find out which files there are on the server.

hi there,
iam using xitami 2.4d9 on win2k.
works fine in general.
but today i found a file memtrace.lst, which happened to be 8GB in size.
locked up my harddrive a bit :-)
does anyone know what this is good for? Can I prevent it being generated 
another time?
thanks for your comments

Looking at the source code, it seems to be a debug file the iMatix Standard 
Function Library generates while exiting if it discovers a memory leak (the 
programmers at iMatix are very careful about memory leaks, which is 
probably why Xitami takes up so little memory... many programs leak memory 
quite badly, which is why you need to restart them and/or Windows so often).

It should never be generated; the fact that it has means something broke. 
I'm sure it shouldn't be as large as 8GB though... how long had Xitami been 
running for?

I'm not sure how to avoid it. Creating a read-only file called memtrace.lst 
might possibly block Xitami from writing it (the name is hard-coded, it 
won't try other names like it does with the logfiles).

to iMatix programmers
=====================

Should mem_assert even be enabled in a production build? sflmem.h seems to 
define it even when DEBUG isn't #defined - shouldn't it be an abort or even 
a no-op outside debug mode, rather than generating a huge log before it 
aborts?
It appears it's only called just before exit, anyway.

In fact, only 5 hours. Hard to believe such a writing rate.

>From more source code reading, it's actually all written on exit, but the file is a record of *all* the memory Xitami allocated and deallocated (which will probably only be a few bytes at a time in some places). 8GB in 5 hours does seem about right for that, but writing the file at all seems like debug-version behaviour.

Try creating a read-only file with the same name in the same folder... if this problem persists and Xitami manages to overwrite it, you'll just have to clean up after it when you exit :-( You could also try a different Xitami version and see if whatever memory leak caused this has been fixed.

The file is written on exit, if there is any memory that was allocated
but has not been freed.  It lists only the memory that was allocated,
but not freed, including where it was allocated.

To have written an 8GB file, the pointers through the memory allocated
must have got themselves into a nasty loop somewhere, so you'll probably
find the 8GB file contains a _lot_ of repeats.

As to whether it should be enabled in a production version; that's a
matter for opinion.  We generally try for "zero leaks" (because that's a
whole lot better if you're leaving something running for a long time),
and thus in theory it shouldn't matter if it's enabled in a production
version.

Subject: [Xitami] simple cgi question
Message-ID: <B0003504667@roy.WORLDPOST.COM>

Using xitami vanilla on win2k pro. "workstation". (IE5)
Trying to learn perl, cgi w/Xitami...on my local pc,
sorry if problem is very simple.

I can not get cgi script to execute.

Here's the script:

#!C:\Perl\bin

print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "Hello World";
#end script

The shebang line is the path to my perl bin folder.
The script runs ok in a dos box.
The script name is: hello.pl and is in C:\Xitami\cgi-bin
If I point the browser to http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/testcgi
it works and shows env. variables.

But:
If I point browser to: http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/hello
then I get a default IE5 page saying there was a problem
opening this pg.

Any help appreciated to get me started. Thanks, Lee

Yes.  With the help of a perl script in the case of the (production) 2.4
release, and internally in the case of the (beta) 2.5.

NOTE that this is the "core" SSI support, not various extensions that
some webservers have added on.

try http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/hello.pl.
if that fails rename the script to just hello with no extension.
this forces the #!perl line because windows has no idea what to do with it.

if this works you then need to look at the ascociation of the .pl files in
windows and make sure that all .pl files are ascociated with perl.exe

Greetings;

Actually, the problem is the first line. You need the path
of perl. Probably something like #!C:\Perl\bin\perl or
you can just make it #!perl if the perl\bin directory is in
your path.

Good Luck!

Check the following:

*.pl does not need to be bound to perl.exe
the path is irrelevant.
perl.exe must be in the path-statement of your computer so Xitami is able 
to find it.
if your script is called hello, it should work then.
if it is called hello.pl you need to call hello.pl of course (not even 
windows ignores the file endings, it just does not show them by default).
it is possible that you have to call the script from a html-page inside xitami.
if all of the above does not work, you should check your installation and 
maybe even check if you have saved the script as plain text or not.

Good luck,

Hugo

It's called perlssi.  And if you installed Xitami 2.4, it's already in the
right place.

Ewen,

if the perl script is already in release 2.4d9 then what else do I need to
do????

I am running version 2.4d9, and I am pointing a virtual host with an index
file named "index.shtml" which has my server side includes.

However, when I browse to this page I get a directory listing, and not the
display of the page.  I have already made sure that the virtual host looks
for files called "index.shtml" as the index file.

WHy will Xitami not serve this page properly?

Alvaro

Hello,

xitami 2.5b4
win ME

I sucessfully configured mitchtemple.com but www.mitchtemple.com does not work.

I have assosiated mitchtemple.cfg with both urls via the
Configuration-VHosts page.

I also tried enabling debug logs on the main config page, but no logs are generated.

Please help,

Have you created an alias listing in DNS pointing www to mitchtemple.com?
Without the DNS it will never get to Xitami to go through configuration.

This is how I got Perl running in Xitami
it allows me to use,

<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/test.pl" -->

This SSI command
which is a potential security risk for your system
is only accepted if the environment variable
SSI_INSECURE is set to 'yes'
Under Windows NT
in the System Control Panel
under 'Environment
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Start->Settings->Control Panel
 
Double click on System
 
>From the pop-up box select the Environment tab
 
 In the Variable entry field type SSI_INSECURE
 In the Value entry field type YES
 (Make sure it goes where you want it,
  System Variables probably.)
 
Click OK
 
Reboot?  (I don't know if this is required.)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

under Windows 95/98 by adding
SET SSI_INSECURE=yes to the autoexec.bat. 
to run SSI.
If Perl is installed correctly?
On a windows system,
You then should be able to call
Perl from anywhere in your system.
This allows the shebang to be #! perl -w
and does not need to be like this
#! c:\perl\bin\perl.exe
this also allows the use of
#! /usr/bin/perl
for the shebang. so as long
as we don't use win32 specific modules
or system calls we can keep our programs
cross platform Compatible.

Running Windows98
Xitami v2.4d6

in your
autoexec.bat

SET PATH=C:\PERL\BIN;%PATH%
SET SSI_INSECURE=YES

defaults.cfg
[Filter]
    .shtm=perlssi
    .shtml=perlssi 
    .ssi=perlssi   
[Ssi]
    Enabled=1
    Exec=1

hope this helps

Thanks you all for the replies, including those concerning the disclaimer.
It's part and parcel of living in the UK now, where privacy laws are under
considerable threat. Our govt. likes to snoop, so does your but they haven't
told you yet!

Anyway, I digress. It turns out that all I needed to do was to add the
following to read the working directory of the initiating script i.e.
		$DocRoot = $ENV{'DOCUMENT_ROOT'};

Then by appending this to the 'open(script)' command it worked OK.


Please forgive the coding samples, I only started on Perl a couple of weeks
ago. Lots to learn still... but such a powerful language.

Regards & Thanks

David

Subject: [Xitami] CGI Scripting


I have a Perl script in webroot/cgi-bin, which reads a text file in and
outputs it in HTML format to the requesting browser (see smaple script
below). Well, that's what it's supposed to do.

It works at the DOS prompt, opening the file and printing output to the
screen. However, if I try the script through a browser, the server returns
no file contents. I assumed the problem was a permissions error, so as a
brute force resolution, I gave Everyone, Full Permissions to the cgi-bin
directory, which still doesn't work.

The Xitami server itself is running under the NT Administrator user, so
should definitely be included in the Everyone group and have full
permissions to all files on the local machine. The working dir. is set to
"-" as recommended, yet it manages to create temporary files in D:\Temp,
which contain the output sent to the screen. So why can't it read in the
files?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample Script:

#!perl

# Define Variables
	$Script;
	$lines;

# Read Name of Script
	$Script = $ENV{'SCRIPT_NAME'};
	if ($Script eq "") {$Script = "default.txt"};

# Open Script
	open(TXT, "<".$Script);
	@text=<TXT>;
	close(TXT);

# Print Script to screen
	&Header;
	print "\nScript to be processed: <b>".$Script."</b><hr>";
	foreach $line(@text){
		print "$line.<br>";
		$lines++;
	}
	if($lines<1){$lines="no"};
	&Footer;

sub Header{
	print "content-type:text/html\n\n<html>";
	print "<title>View File Script</title>";
}

sub Footer{
	print "There are <b>".$lines."</b> lines<br>";
	print "<b>The End</b>";
	print "</html>";
}
#	End viewfile.pl

Send us the [Virtual-hosts] section of your defaults.cfg, nine times out of
ten that is where the problem lies.

Then at this point you need to double check your config file to make sure it
is configured correctly. I would suggest opening it in a text editor and
checking it manually and not using the Xitami Configuration editor. That is
the way I do all of mine and never have a problem. but then I always know
they are correct that way.

Subject: [Xitami] FTP server woes...
Message-ID: <AIEJLJENNEEGIDEIELPGMEHDCAAA.reds@chicagonet.net>

I have installed Xitami and the web server works well. However, I cannot get
FTP to work, which is most frustrating. I suspect my setup is a bit
unusual... can anyone help?

I have an ISDN connection and my machine is behind a router which does NAT.
Because I have a dynamic IP address, I use TZO.com. (I have registered my
domain name to TZO's name servers; software on my machine monitors my
changing IP address and passes this info to TZO, which redirects traffic
which hits its servers looking for me back to my machine.)

People hitting my FTP server typically just get the time-out message.
Occassionally, someone gets logged on anonymously, but then the system drops
them when they try to download something. A tech at TZO was able to upload a
file to my machine, but not download. On my side of the router, everything
seems to work perfectly (the machines that I have can use the FTP service -
although only by using the local machine numbers as addresses... they are
not able to use my internet domain name, something I understand is normal
for being behind a router.)

I noticed that there is a setting in Xitami for Dynamic DNS. I have not been
able to get this configured properly, and suspect this could be the
problem's cause, although I am not even sure of this.

Here is the details on the DDNS settings:

1. Enable DNS sign on? YES/NO (default is NO)
2. DDNS service definition file:  (default is "ddnsdef.xml")
3. Dynamic DNS service:  Default is "DDNS test using localhost".
4. Your server domain name: (no default).
5. Your username or e-mail adddress: (no default). I have given my email
address, which is the user name used by TZO.com.
6. Your password or DDNS key: (no default). I have supplied the TZO "key"
which TZO assigned to me.

I have tried setting No. 1 to YES, No. 2 to the default file of
"ddnsdef.xml", No. 3. to "TZO.com", No. 4 to "elitz.com" and also tried the
name of my local machine, No. 5 to
"reds@chicagonet.net" (my email address), and No. 6 to my assigned TZO key
for elitz.com.

The ddnsdef.xml file has a section relevant to when No. 3 is set to
"TZO.com".  It reads as follows:

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    tzo.com

    Service for tzo.com domains.  TZO uses an e-mail address as the
username,
    and a generated key as password.  Fast DNS updates.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------->
<SERVICE
  NAME  = "tzo.com"
  TITLE = "tzo.com"
  HOST  = "rh.tzo.com"
  URL   = "tzo.com"
  PORT  = "21333" >
  <SIGNON
    URL  = "/webclient/rhsignedon.html"
    ARGS =
"TZOName=$(domain)&Email=$(username)&TZOKey=$(password)&CType=6&B1=Sign+On+t
o+TZO+DDNS+Servers"
    SEND = "GET $(url)?$(args) HTTP/1.0\r\n$(httpheaders)" />
  <SIGNOFF
    URL  = "/webclient/signedoff.html"
    ARGS = "B1=Sign+Me+Off+from+TZO"
    SEND = "GET $(url)?$(args) HTTP/1.0\r\n$(httpheaders)" />
</SERVICE>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The error message generated in the Xitami console message window is:

2001/11/04 14:53:21: xiddns: 'localhost': HTTP/1.1 404 Not found

The TZO tech has asked that I work with Xitami people, as he is not sure of
the problem. He seemed to feel that the problem was that Xitami is using IP
references that are exclusively for local use: 192.168.1.2 and 127.0.0.1. I
think he may be right (these IP numbers are in the "statistics" window that
appears when I click the Xitami icon) and that the solution is to get Xitami
to recognize my changing IP, hence my question about DDNS.

Thank you.

Subject: [Xitami] Webmask??  How do I block a list of IP addresses?
In-Reply-To: <200111041521.AA173146422@ucdavis-alumni.com>
Message-ID: <NDBBIDKBILPOMBMKDOOCKEPHCDAA.alsiman@cofs.net>

I want to block some IP addresses.  From what I understand this is done by
modifying the [webmask] in the defaults.cfg file.

I have pointed my webmask to a file listing the ip addresses I want to
block.  The file is called blockiplist.txt.

My config looks like this:
webmask=@blockiplist.txt

Now, what goes in that text file???  How do I type in the addresses??

Should I put in the [webmask] at the top??

Should I separate each IP address with a comma??  or just list them down the
document by hitting ENTER after each one???

Ben,

You can use syntax similar to <!--#Include virtual="whatever.file" --> 
to include any file in your pages. For more on Xitami and SSI, check:

This URL means "start from the current folder /cgi-bin/ (because the SRC 
doesn't start with "/"), go up 3 levels (../../../), go into the images/ 
folder, and get bevel_bg.jpg". You can't go up 3 levels from /cgi-bin/ 
because when you go up 1 level you get to the root folder, /, and you can't 
go up a level again from /; so you certainly can't go up 2 levels!

I'd suggest replacing all your image paths with something like 
SRC="/espimages/bevel_bg.jpg" which will go to the server root, then go 
into an espimages/ subfolder, then download bevel_bg.jpg; then put your 
images in an espimages subfolder of your web pages root (e.g. 
c:\xitami\webpages\espimages on a default install). (Xitami uses the images 
subdirectory already, for its own built-in images like the directory 
listing icons)

If you insist on using relative URLs, remember that they all have to be 
relative to where your CGI script is, i.e. relative to the cgi-bin folder.

Also remember that they're URLs and not file paths: if your cgi-bin is in 
c:\xitami\cgi-bin, you can't get to c:\images with ../../images/ - the "up 
one level" is handled by the user's Web browser, which has no idea where 
stuff is on your hard disk.

I realise this isn't particularly clear, so here's a silly example:

Suppose your server is set up with an alias for /docs/, as follows:

- / points to c:\xitami\webpages, like the default setup
- /cgi-bin/ points to c:\xitami\cgi-bin, again like the default setup
- /docs/ points to d:\my documents\public_html

Suppose you're looking at this site in a Web browser, and you're looking at 
http://myserver/docs/MyPlanToTakeOverTheWorld.html. When you go to this 
page, Xitami will look up what /docs/ means and return the contents of 
d:\my documents\public_html\MyPlanToTakeOverTheWorld.html. If this file 
contains a hyperlink to "../MoreRanting.html", you might expect that to 
mean d:\my documents\MoreRanting.html.

However, the ../ is resolved by the web browser, not the server. All the 
web browser knows is that it's at a server called http://myserver, in a 
folder called /docs/, looking at HereIsARant.html. So, it takes the current 
folder (/docs/), goes up one level (to /), and downloads MoreRanting.html 
from that folder - that's http://myserver/MoreRanting.html.

Xitami looks up what / means, looks for a file called MoreRanting.html, and 
dutifully returns c:\xitami\webpages\MoreRanting.html.

This is good, because it means there's no way a web browser can get at 
documents in folders you haven't specifically added to the server. For 
example, if it worked the way you seem to have assumed, the browser could 
request http://myserver/../defaults.aut and get c:\xitami\defaults.aut. 
This would be bad, because defaults.aut is a list of usernames and 
passwords for the password-protected pages on your server, if you have 
any... don't worry though, this doesn't actually happen.

For the same reason, to get a hyperlink to something you've stored in 
webpages from a script in cgi-bin, you just go "../something" or 
"/something", not "../webpages/something" - and to get from webpages to 
cgi-bin, you just go "cgi-bin" and not "../cgi-bin" (this would make no 
sense because you're already at the root as far as a web browser is 
concerned, so you can't go up any further).

If you're running Xitami on your PC, that *is* the host server. Your web 
browser (Internet Explorer, Netscape, whatever) doesn't read from the disk 
itself if you're testing your site through Xitami - all it knows about your 
site is what Xitami tells it.

If you set an alias like 

[Alias]
images=c:\images

then, for example, going to the URL http://127.0.0.1/images/bevel_bg.jpg 
will get you the contents of the file 'c:\images\bevel_bg.jpg'. (* footnote)

In general, an alias like

[Alias]
aliased/server/path=c:\real\path\on\disk

will map the URL 
http://127.0.0.1/aliased/server/path/somefolder/somefile.ext
to the real file 
c:\real\path\on\disk\somefolder\somefile.ext
(I hope you can see where the the components of this path come from).

It sounds as though your HTML writing software is getting its relative 
paths wrong, or making big assumptions about how your real disk filesystem 
maps to the server's "virtual filesystem". If the current working directory 
is '/cgi-bin', which it is for these scripts, your web browser *can't* go 
up 3 levels, because as far as it can see there's only one level to go up 
through (it goes up one level to '/', then can't see any further).

If you have an alias like the one above you can use an image with a tag like

<img src="../images/bevel.jpg" alt="">

which your web browser will expand to
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/../images/bevel.jpg
then contract to
http://127.0.0.1/images/bevel.jpg
before it sends 
the request.

It may be better to use an absolute path like

<img src="/images/bevel.jpg" alt=""> (this one is probably better),

which your web browser will expand to http://127.0.0.1/images/bevel.jpg 
before it sends the request.

It's impossible to go up 3 levels because your browser doesn't know there's 
anything above the root, so it won't send a request which goes above /; and 
because, for security reasons, Xitami won't send files from outside the 
webpages root, unless it's been told to do so by an alias. This is to 
prevent arbitrary users doing things like sending a request for something 
like http://127.0.0.1/../../windows/system/user.dat and getting half your 
Registry.


*: Xitami assumes your 'images' directory contains the icons which come 
with it (this isn't great design IMO, but that's how it works). If you want 
directory listings to look right, you might need to copy the images from 
c:\xitami\webpages\images (or wherever you have Xitami installed) into the 
folder which will be accessible as http://127.0.0.1/images/ (e.g. 
c:\images).

No, not really. The best way to make this work is to change the src 
attribute of the <IMG> tags to /images/whatever.gif. If you use an 
automatic program like Frontpage or Dreamweaver or something to make your 
HTML, either hand-edit the <IMG> tags or get a different automatic program.
Relative paths (especially ones with .. in them) are generally good for 
simple hierarchical sites where everything goes in one folder (i.e. pure 
HTML/images sites) and bad for sites with CGI, aliases, or anything else 
advanced.

The rest of this e-mail describes a hack to make it behave like you ask for 
- it probably isn't a good idea though, because it's a very weird 
configuration and will break as soon as you upload it to any other server 
(i.e. any computer not running your personal hand-configured copy of 
Xitami) - so if you upload your pages to your ISP's web server, or a 
commercial web host, or basically any computer you don't actually have 
physical access to, it won't work. Consider very carefully whether this is 
what you want...

*** If you want a reasonably normal server, look away now ;-) ***






It's _possible_ to do what you're asking by using an extra alias to 
deliberately "move" ESP deeper into the site hierarchy. See the notes 
above, and note that if you later decide you want to move your site to your 
ISP or commercial host's server, IT WON'T WORK so don't ask me to fix it.

Exactly what you do depends on the URL to your script, not the folder the 
content is kept in. Web browsers don't know that your pages are in 
c:\xitami\cgi-bin\esp-pages (how would they?), but they do know the URL 
they just used to get at the script which serves the pages.

If the ***URL for your script*** is currently something like
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/myscript?page=mypage
then you could do:

-- begin cfg section
[Alias]
images=c:\images

[Cgi-Alias]
cgi-bin/esp/esp=c:\Xitami\cgi-bin
-- end cfg section

and tell people that the new URL is:
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/esp/esp/myscript?page=mypage

(note the two completely pointless esp "folders", to make sure going up 3 
levels gets you somewhere sensible)

Or, if the ***URL for your script***  is currently something like
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/esp-pages/myscript?page=mypage
then you could do:

-- begin cfg section
[Alias]
images=c:\images

[Cgi-Alias]
cgi-bin/esp/esp-pages=c:\Xitami\cgi-bin\esp-pages
-- end cfg section

and tell people that the new URL is:
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/esp/esp-pages/myscript?page=mypage

Neither of these is a clever idea. Don't use them if you want your server 
to be anywhere near normal.

Does your file have an extension of  '.ssi', '.shtm', or
'.shtml'? If not it won't work. If it does then a statement
as below or like <!--#include virtual="rexxdate.htm"-->
should include the referenced file. The
virtual="whatever.file" is the path relative to the html
page that contains it, or an absolute path, and they are
server paths, starting from, and within server-root.

It works for me. I am running v2.5b4 on NT 4.0 SP4. Maybe
you need to upgrade to a newer version?

Good Luck!
Dennis

Not quite.

if you add the alias

images_esp=c:\xitami\images_esp\

then to link to an image called filename.gif in that directory, you would
use:

http://127.0.0.1/images_esp/filename.gif

In other words, the alias *replaces* the actual directory.

Subject: [Xitami] The LRWP protocol
Message-ID: <EX-20011106-163507-0001@exchange.fiserv-missive1.fiserv.net>

I've been using LRWP for a couple of years and it works fine.
To answer your questions:

1. Yes, you should certainly make the LRWP programs executable.  You will
need to run them.  They are not executed by Xitami.  They connect to Xitami
via a socket (port xx81).

2.  I don't think it matters where you put them.  Mine are in a directory
which also contains the Xitami directory.

3.  I don't know about WBA, but look in Xitami.cfg.  LRWP is probably already
enabled by default

If you try out the examples I don't think you will have any trouble.  The only
thing I had to do special was to modify lrwplib.c somewhat to make it more
"COBOL-friendly", since most of our stuff is COBOL.

Good luck.

Greetings;

with the alias you have below the url would be
http://127.0.0.1/images_esp/something.gif and so on.

No matter where the actual path points to you only use the
alias in the url. And you can't use .. and such to get out
of the tree under the alias. You need to experiment with
simple scripts and simple pages so you can quickly see what
works and what doesn't.

Good Luck!

Is there any way to get /admin to give a 404 or some such, as if it doesn't exist?  Disabling the WBA doesn't seem to do this.

The WBA is failing.  The server seems to be working well for most virtual
hosts, with the exception of two.

However, the WBA no longer goes to the right url when clicking on its links.
For example, if I click on a vhost, it will take me to the main screen....no
matter which vhost or link I hit, it will always go back to the main screen.

Are you perhaps using the browser's forward & back buttons?  That's almost exactly what happens when you use them instead of the
ones built into the WBA.

No, I am not.  I am just navigating through the buttons and hyperlinks.

About all I have done is create the defaults.cfg file that is described on
the xitami.cfg file.  I have also updated the security file with a webmask
pointing to a file with a list of IP addresses to block.

Beyond that, all I have is about 7 virtual hosts, most of which work, except
for two of them.  I dont know what could be wrong with them.  I have already
gone into their cfg files to see if their path is correct, and found
everything in order.

Is this a server crash???

How about Perl do you have this installed or does 2.5b4 handle SSI ?

I'm not sure if this counts as a bug or a feature :-/ but you will 
generally find it better to always use forward slashes in the Xitami files

I.e. do images_esp=c:/xitami/images_esp/

be way faster than perl / CGI once you get the files in the right format

Francis,

I've moved to PHP over perl and cgi.  It seems to be a whole lot faster.  I
can pars and display over 2300 lines in a flat file in less than 3 seconds.
And, my server is a lowly Compag P166 running NT/Xitami.

Message-ID: <200111071226.GAA09629@bevr150.ew.us.am.ericsson.se>

Hi -

I'm running Xitami 2.5b5 on a PII-450 system running Win2K-SP2.

Xitami will run for a while - a day or so - but eventually - it
crashes.  It says it's generating an error log, but I can't find it -
it's not in the normal Xitami log area.  As it typically happens when
I'm not home or around, I don't know exactly when it crashes - or if
it correlates to being asked to fetch some page - but the access and
error logs indicate nothing unusual (other than the occasional Code
Red II stuff).

I just upgraded to Win2K from WinNT4.0 - and this has started
happening since the upgrade.  Under 4.0, it was solid as a rock.
I know that the Xitami on-line help doesn't explicitly say that it
runs under Win2K... and maybe it doesn't.

Another thing - this happened under NT as well - but when I go to
re-start Xitami after it has either died on its own or because I've
stopped it for whatever reason - it never comes back up - I get a
flash of the green Xitami icon in the traybar, a message box that says 
the HTTP service was started on port 80, and then when the Xitami icon 
goes red.

Anyone have any ideas about either of these problems?

Thanks in advance...

Regards,
Kevin Autrey

Switch to the NT service version of Xitami. You won't regret the move.

17 months uptime with it here, never a glitch. It runs on my Win2K
Professional workstation and Win2K Server machine 24/7.

You still haven't quite got it.

The alias is just   images_esp
and the Points to path: is   c:\xitami\images_esp\

That should work much better!

Good Luck!

try handediting the defaults.cfg file in c:\xitami . Under the [alias] 
section add the line you want
( images_esp=c:/xitami/images_esp/") note using /es not \es!

For example I just did this
Vnc = "c:/xitami/vnc_docs/"
to test and it worked fine

Message-ID: <3BE9780D.4030005@freesbee.fr>

Interesting bug with 2.5b4 and 2.5b5 (haven't checked any 2.4 versions) 
- within the folder where you installed Xitami (e.g. c:\xitami) you must 
have a directory called webpages even if your web root is somewhere 
completely different (such as D:\webroot). As far as I can see the 
/xitami/webpages directory can be empty but it must exist!

Nevertheless, including such a disclaimer on mails sent on the one-to-many
basis of a mailing list is consummately stupid, because YOU have no
control over the members of the set which your disclaimer calls "intended
recipients", since members may join and leave the list at any time, and
in most cases any legislation upon which you are relying is positively
NOT applicable to the "recipients".

I would advise anyone with such boilerplate inclusions to configure their
mailers so as NOT to send it when the addressee is a mailing list; ditto
for postings to newsgroups, where such disclaimers are equally risible.

PHBs require educating as to the differing modes in which e-mail might be
used: for them to issue an edict requiring such boilerplate on mails
which are not one-to-one (or one-to-few) merely reinforces just why they
ARE pointy-haired bosses.

no, i don't have perl installed to my knowledge, and I don't think xitami
supports ssi the right way, yet, as according to their website.
Where can I get perl and where do I put it so this SSI will work?  Will the

In-Reply-To: <3BE92F4A.A06E0CEA@2cah.com>

I am trying the beta release of 2.5b Xitami.

I am having trouble getting Xitami to work with the two virtual hosts I
created.  When I type in the DNS name, I get the Xitami screen and not the
vhost web site.

What could I be doing wrong???

When setting up the vhosts I set the IP address to "All (recommended) and
the Host name to www.myvhost.com.

What is going on??

Hi i have had this problem in the past sometimes its the vh wizard not
coping with the length of the name ...which means you have to edit the file
manually.
the thing i found that fixed the problem many many versions back was to set
up aliases for the hosted domains as well.

i have ,since then, done this each time i set up a new domain and short of
the odd spelling error, never had a problem since.

Hi,

I have xitami on Win2k professional-sp1 and it runs fine.
When you say "upgrade" you realy mean upgrade over nt4 or did
you do a clean installation (format & all) ?
For the error log look into the config pannel > administration tools > event
analyzer.
I don't know if these are correct names because i have french version, but
they should look like.

Good Morning!

At the first. I would like to say than your software 'Xitami' is wonderful,
sincerly very good.
I had to install a Server in http://wwwgssr.uah.es and I have only a problem
with the CGIs. With the HTTP or FTP configuration I haven't any problem.

My CGI is wrotten with C, simple and standard C. The program is right, but I
can not that it will be on. You can try in
http://wwwgssr.uah.es/cg-bin/contador.exe

Please, if you know what i am doing wrong, tell me (my operating system is
W2kProfessional)

Your sinceraly and thanks for your time.

The first "i" in "cgi-bin" in the URL you posted isn't a plain "i" but
has an accute accent over it. You probably want a plain "i" in the URL. 

http://wwwgssr.uah.es/cgi-bin/contador.exe "works" for me, EXCEPT it
DOWNLOADED your EXE program to MY machine! I don't want it, and you
probably don't want everybody to have it. 

Re-check your cgi-bin settings. CGI programs should go in someplace like
C:\Xitami\cgi-bin, _OUTSIDE_ the Web-root folder C:\Xitami\webpages. Set
the CGI options so files in that CGI directory can only be executed, NOT
downloaded directly.

You said than you just upgrade to Win2k from WinNT4.0, well, is better than
you format all the machine and install a new copy of your operating system.
Then, you would install Xitami. I work with Xitami and Win2k Professional
and it's a very good web server. bw3224d9.exe is my version. and you can
reinicialite without problems.

Hello!

In your html file there is a string

<!-- #exec cmd="http://wwwgssr.uah.es/cgi-bin/contador" -->

First feel the difference between cgi and server side includes (ssi).

If you use ssi, then this string can be like a
<!-- #exec cmd="C:/web/cgi-bin/contador.exe" -->
As you see there is a LOCAL path not remote.

And you must configure your Xitami and system to operate with ssi.

Best wishes!

Apparently xitami.com is down.  A friend of mine confirmed this.  100% loss

Also, I can't get ssi to work.  I installed the lastest version of active
perl from activestate.com, then renamed my index.html file to index.shtml
and <!--#include virtual="example.htm"--> didn't work.  SSI is enabled in
the settings.  This is really disappointing.
Also, how do I get the server to "recover silently from errors"???

What does your errors.log
access.log and cgierr.log
have in it
in your defaults.cfg file do you have these tags
? Does http://127.0.0.1/testssi.ssi
work?

I just booted to windows to check the tag where
I run Xitami and it worked fine
is perl set in your path,
I'm sure it should be I think activestate
does this during install but wouldn't hurt
to check the autoexec.bat file and make sure

Sorry about this.  The machine that xitami.com is hosted on has been
moved to a different IP block at the same ISP; and it's taking a little
while for the DNS changes to come through.  The new IP address
(203.79.85.250) should be visible soon.

I have written a servlet and tested it out. It seems to work fine. I can get
to the web page through the server on Xitami but when I try to access the
servlet it tells me the page cannot be found. Are there special places you
have to put stuff and settings that need to be made on the server?

Message-ID: <4.3.2.7.2.20011109160440.00aa3d00@pop.chello.se>

Hi guys,
I cant get .cgi scripts to work in Xitami,
all scripts with .pl extension are working without problems.
My OS is Win98 and I have associated both .cgi and .pl with Perl
(Active Perl), and added Perl to path in autoexec.
Any ideas what this depends on?

You don't.

What permissions do you want? 

Windows does not have the eXecutable flag so that is not needed (as it
would be on unix). Xitami uses rules similar to DOS to decide if a file
can be executed. First: Xitami will run scripts only in certain
directories, typically c:\xitami\cgi-bin. Then it looks for EXE, COM or
BAT extension (the closest DOS comes to an X flag). Xitami also examines
for the "MZ" header that marks a true EXE file (but COM files must be
loaded on blind faith). If the file appears to be text and isn't BAT, it
looks for "perl" in the first #! line and calls Perl either at the
specified place or by tracing PATH.

Subject: [Xitami] I need a page hit counter
Message-ID: <200111101113984.SM00351@there>

I'm looking for a Page Hit counter, a simple text based one to show the 
number of times the page has been visited to the visitor.

I've looked through the archives and see this is a frequent question, but all 
of the links that I tried pointed to broken or non-relevant links (some of 
the messages where from 1999).

Also the URL given in the FAQ for this question does not work any more either.

All of the counter programs I've found so far require DOCUMENT_URI to be set
in the environment, and Xitami does not support this.

So how do you do a counter in Xitami?

Okay, I've double-checked. Xitami does not set the DOCUMENT_URI 
variable for CGI programs. You'll have to find a web counter that 
does not use this. I suggest you ask the discussion group to see if 
anyone has one they prefer.

I use Count from http://www.muquit.com/muquit/software/Count/Count.html

This is not a text only counter, though.  It is a CGI-based counter that
dynamically creates a GIF image for the hit count. It has a lot of options
and is very configurable.  I have been using it for a while and it seems
to work pretty well with Xitami 2.5b5

I forgot to mention that I have been using version 2.5 of the counter

I've looked on the web and it should indeed be working, but I have not
got it working with a file-mask either..

I tried to fill that file with the following:
====
!62.163.247.39
!62.194.19.162
!62.194.20.18
!62.194.59.33
!62.194.80.21
!62.194.134.15
!62.163.206.118
*
====

But this does not work. Given IP's still show up in my access-logs...

AES> Should I put in the [webmask] at the top??

AES> Should I separate each IP address with a comma??  or just list them down the
AES> document by hitting ENTER after each one???

If anybody has the answer I would like to know as well!

Subject: [Xitami] Dynamic IP... is anyone else using it?
Message-ID: <AIEJLJENNEEGIDEIELPGEEIBCAAA.reds@chicagonet.net>

I am using xitami v2.5b4 and have had no luck getting the DDNS feature to
work. Is anyone using this that might be able to lend a hand? I am using
TZO.com and have not been able to get the server to connect to TZO's machine
and retreive my dynamic IP.

The configuration page in Xitami gives me the "In progress... check console
messages" response whenever I try to sign on. In the message section, I get
the following log entries:

2001/11/10 19:31:02: xiddns: sending DDNS sign-on
2001/11/10 19:31:02: xiddns: 'localhost': HTTP/1.1 404 Not found

I also have noticed that I can't get the console to keep my settings.  They
return to the default settings whenever I leave the DDNS page, even if I hit
the "save" button.

Thank you.

-Carl.

In-Reply-To: <200110050320.PAA04044@pagoda.in.naos.co.nz>
References: Message from bhk@dsl.co.uk (Brian {Hamilton Kelly})    of "Tue, 25 Sep 2001 18:49:24 +0100." <45172@dsl.co.uk>

I haven't seen this posted.

Xitami v2.5b5
Norton AntiVirus v4.05
WindowsXP/98/95

If I do a network virus check using Norton, any machine on the lan 
running Xitami will often (not always) lock up.  In WindowsXP only 
Xitami has to be restarted.  The local machine running Xitami and 
Norton never locks up.

I  noticed this when I began running Norton automatically at night and 
the next morning I would have to restart servers.  Without Xitami and 
Norton both runing there is never a problem.

There have been no viruses. (Knock on silicon.)

This version of Norton is one of the last forever free network capable 
versions.  The virus definitions have to be updated manually but free is 
better than a yearly fee.

Regards,

Michael

You can place your servlets anywhere but you have to put their path into
your CLASSPATH variable. And don't forget to run servletrunner of course.

In my case, i've created an directory called java under c:\xitami\ and I
located in this place the servletrunner and a directory called "servlets".
This directory is put in the classpath; and it works.

Does anyone know if it is possible to input a dynamic

would allow access to the server?  I tried before, but
I couldn't get it to work.  So is this there some
setting for the server to lookup that ip before
deciding on whether to allow a person access to server
or not?

Depends on how your calling it
exec, include, or <img src="/cgi-bin/counter4.pl" ALT="counter4">

the <!--exec=cgi will not pass params as ?i the <img src should be used

hope this helps

Message-ID: <3BEF9001.1040705@gmx.net>

I have a problem with the $PHP_SELF variable. Since Version 2.4d5 (or d4 
I'm not sure) this PHP variable which should be filled with the calling 
script's filename is empty. It seems that Xitami doesn't hand over the 
information needed by PHP to fill this variable.
For a while I used $SCRIPT_NAME instead but it's a bit uncomfortable 
because I have to edit all scripts before uploading them to my host due 
to his configuration where this variable is filled with the path to PHP 
itself.
This problem started occuring with the obove mentioned version d4 or d5 
of Xitami. Before that $PHP_SELF was fully available.

Any other idea to get around this or how to get $PHP_SELF to work agian?

Seems like I'm the only one having this problem...
currently this is how I'm solving this problem:

$serv = $SERVER_SOFTWARE;
function OwnName() {
 global $serv;
 if($serv == "Xitami") return true;
}

and

<FORM action="<?php if(OwnName()) { echo $SCRIPT_NAME; } else { echo 
$PHP_SELF; }; ?>" method="POST">

for some reason you can't test for $SERVER_SOFTWARE directly

maybe there's still another sollution out there?!

Yep, you need to install Xifusion to handle empty variables with xitami and
php.

It's a free tool and works perfect.

Which Version Of PHP ???

The current version of PHP changed which variable it uses to find its
script. The PHP site documents this as a security issue. Xitami does not
(AFAIK, never did) fill this variable.

I had a BAT file which patched this under DOS/Win. It was posted here
last year. Unfortunately I lost most of my older messages since then. I
*think* the trick is to SET PATH_INFO the same as SCRIPT_PATH and then
call PHP.

Carl my IP address is dynamic also.  I am also using TZO to resolve the 
dynamic IP issue and have been successful in running Xitami behind a 
router.  I never bothered to setup the DDNS feature in Xitami since I am 
already running the TZO client on my server.  Since I am on a network and 
behind a router I am also using a DNS server which allows me to 
access "MYDomain.com" from any pc on my network.  "Simple DNS' located at 
http://www.jhsoft.com/ offers a solution for this, remember also that if 
you're using a router you will have to map port 80 to the machine that 
you're running Xitami on.

Message-ID: <AIEJLJENNEEGIDEIELPGMEIGCAAA.reds@chicagonet.net>

The only feature I have not been able to implement with Xitami using the TZO
client is FTP. I was trying to get the integrated DDNS function in Xitami to
work only because I thought it might resolve my FTP problem. Perhaps my real
problem with FTP is that I am also behind a router? Any help you could give
me with that issue, Stephen, -or anyone else-, would be greatly appreciated.

ROUTER ISSUE:

My machine, like Stephen's machine, is part of a netork, but only a small
one consisting of my machine and another machine used to play occassional
two-player games. All unsolicited internet traffic is routed to my main
machine - as determined by a setting in the router software. Can anyone
suggest a reason why the Xitami web server works to serve web pages to
people outside my network, but won't work to serve FTP? The TZO tech support
people have been nice, but unable to help with this, suggesting that the
problem may be my Xitami settings. They say that their FTP client keeps
getting 192.168.1.2 as my machine's IP address (my machine's local IP) when
they hit my site (when the TZO client is running), instead of the dynamic
address assigned by my ISP.

I have read everything I can about my router, but have found no obvious
settings which would tell it to treat FTP traffic in a certain way. The
router is a 3Com router and is configured via a web page interface, so the
emphasis of the router software is on keeping things simple. I was concerned
that the router wasn't designed to do what I'm doing in mind, but the good
news is that I have found that I can telnet to my router's IP address, and
that there are many "unimplemented" text commands that can change the
router's settings, if necessary. I would obviously rather run just Xitami if
possible, rather than Xitami and the TZO client.

DDNS ISSUE:

The router may be the ultimate solution to my problem, but even so, it does
not explain why the Xitami DDNS feature is not working with TZO, or explain
the rather cryptic error messages I am getting from Xitami. I am still
curious about that. I don't think this feature is well implemented.

DNS SERVER:

Thanks, Stephen, for the suggestion about http://www.jhsoft.com/. I reviewed
the pages there, but don't think this is an issue for me. As I understand
it, a DNS server would be something I would be interested in if I had a lot
of machines on my side of the router, right? My current network setting in
Windows ME is "DNS disabled."

TESTING MY OWN WEB PAGE/FTP PAGE:

Finally, someone told me that, because I was behind a router, I simply
cannot visit my own machine through the internet. In other words, although I
can hit http://192.168.1.2 or "trick" my machine into taking me to my own
web page by mapping my domain to this IP through the "hosts" file, there is
no way for me to test my site as people on the other side of the router
would see it. This has been very frustrating because Xitami works
beautifully on this side of the router. It's only when I get involved in the
dynamic IP stuff that things don't work.

I've been playing with this for more than 3 weeks now with almost no luck.
It's been really frustrating, so I REALLY appreciate any help I get on this.
The thing that has me most confused is that the Web pages serve, the FTP
won't. What gives?

Thanks.

-Carl.

Subject: Re: [Xitami] Dynamic IP... is anyone else using it?


Carl my IP address is dynamic also.  I am also using TZO to resolve the
dynamic IP issue and have been successful in running Xitami behind a
router.  I never bothered to setup the DDNS feature in Xitami since I am
already running the TZO client on my server.  Since I am on a network and
behind a router I am also using a DNS server which allows me to
access "MYDomain.com" from any pc on my network.  "Simple DNS' located at
http://www.jhsoft.com/ offers a solution for this, remember also that if
you're using a router you will have to map port 80 to the machine that
you're running Xitami on.

Ok now look at you shebang line if perl is

#! perl -Tw
use strict;
use CGI::Carp "fatalsToBrowser";
print "Context-Type: image/\n\n"; #should be the first

500 is an internal server error and usually
a syntax error is the cause see if is will run

I think what you have is an FTP client problem related to Network 
Address Translation (NAT). It is not a DDNS problem a Xitami problem as 
it will occur with other FTP servers.

Try getting a remote machine to run a very simple client (e.g. the CLI 
ftp client included with windows 9x). It should have no problem, whereas 
the funky GUI client may fail. I have seen this behavious with Netscape 
4.x and believe it also occurs with other clients. The problem is this:

Netscape's FTP client issues a command (SYST I think) to the FTP server 
to tell it what IP address it has and then tries to connect to that IP 
address for future connections. This is stupid because the FTP cleint 
already has an IP address that works. Of course this IP address is 
embedded within the message so the NAT s/w on the router doesn't modify it.

The way to check this is (assuming the simple DOS ftp worked) is to look 
and see if the GUI client does a SYST command or not and what the 
response is.

Currently running the console ver of 2.5b5. In previous releases of 
Xitami the NT service version has lagged the console version and had 
bugs that were fixed by the console version.

Is there anyone running the service version of 2.5b5 who can say whetehr 
the same applies to this version. I'm probably going use the service 
version as I move to production anyway,  but I thought it might not be a 
bad idea to check for known gotchas first...

Francis,

I am using Xitami v2.5b5 Service on my NT.  Never had a problem with it.

So many people seem to have problems with virtual directories, I even have
one virtual directory on another machine in the network.  It's that easy!!
and reliable.

If you are talking about the console to administer Xitami, then it is in
this version.  I'm no guru on this stuff, I just know it works.

It's "lagged" behind only because the binary wasn't rebuilt properly.

The Xitami 2.5b5 _beta_ was built with the same source code for all the
different build versions, so should be basically identical for all of
them.

Keep in mind that 2.5b5 is a beta version and does have known bugs; if
you're going to use it in production carefully check none of those are
going to bite you.

Just a little something that I used when I came across this difference between
Apache & Xitami. This will run
on either Apache or Xitami, I didn't wrap it in a function as it is only
executed once at the beginning of a new
session in my application.

Hope you find this of some help.

        $session->RootPath = stripSlashes( dirname( $PATH_TRANSLATED));     //
Assume we are in the root dir
        $session->BasePath = basename( $session->RootPath);
// Assume we are one directory below the resource root
        if( strlen( trim($PHP_SELF))) $session->BaseURL = dirname( $PHP_SELF);
// & that this matches BasePath - this works with Apache
        else   // Xitami  ???
        {
     // This works for Xitami
               $url = parse_url($HTTP_REFERER);
               $session->BaseURL = dirname( $url["path"]);
        }

Hi Jack.

I am using an OfficeConnect ISDN LAN Modem. I believe it functions like a
stand-alone router. Two computers plug into it, so it has an IP address, and
each of the machines behind it also have one. It does NAT.

I'm not being secretive--- I just don't have my notes handy. It
is a fairly common issue here so (now that I am at the machine
with my hacks) I will reply here. 

In Defaults.cfg: 

 [Filter]
    .php=C:/php/patchphp.bat

patchphp.bat is: 

 @set path_translated=%1
 @C:\php\php.exe

Notes: 

When Xitami sees a ".php" file, it calls the BAT file which sets
the environment variable and then calls PHP.exe. 

I found this was needed for PHP 4, was not needed for PHP 3. 

If you use other extensions for PHP scripts, you will need more
entries in Defaults.cfg.

The "@" prevents DOS from writing to output. (I hate to do that,
but DOS's gibberish confuses things.)

Forward/slash in Xitami config files; back\slash in DOS. (Both
places *may* work the other way... but this is the preferred
syntax for unix-think Xitami and DOS-think Windows.)

I assume "C:" drive and the customary installation directories.
Adapt to your situation.

I ran my copy of LeechFTP, a simple windows-based client to test Frances's
theory. Indeed, I did see that the software issued a SYST command. Of
course, on my side of the router, it doesn't cause any problems. It is only
a problem for people on the outside of my network.

BTW, the possibility that the FTP client was causing the server to send my
internal IP is the original reason why I wanted to bag the TZO "IP catching"
client software and use xitami's imbedded client to retreive the IP. My
thought was that Xitami would pass the correct IP to the FTP server and
would send to the requesting FTP client my true "internet" IP, instead of
the IP I use on this side of the router.

One user reported that he could upload to me, but not download from me. This
is the person that reported seeing my local IP address, instead of my global
address as he should have seen it. Frances, is this consistent with your
diagnosis? Do you think there is a solution? Anyone else have any ideas?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <039801c16d28$d48993b0$ee02a8c0@development.europeonline.net>

I have a weird problem when compiling xidos32.exe under windows.

If I run the compiled code (both debug and release) from Visual Studio and
ask Xitami to look at an XML document with GSL scripting everything runs
perfectly (I'm most impressed). However, when I execute xidos32 from a DOS
shell, I get a segmentation violation due to some heap memory not
initialised.

I've downloaded the compiled version from the web and this works fine in a
shell. Has anyone come across something like this before?

I'm using VS 6.0 sp 1 on Win2K Professional.

I want to extend the front end for a specific application so I need to be
able to compile.....

It sounds to me like your TZO client may be sending your router mapped IP, I
say this because if they are saying that they get that common network IP
address as the resolved address, it would have to be comming from TZO as
reported to them via client.  Perhaps a matter of the TZO client needing to
know what IP to be providing via the client.  (isp vs network).   I really
see no other way they would see your network IP externally.

You can test this theory by going to the control panel at TZO and placing
your current ISP address manually into the given entry field they provide
for doing this manually- (turn off the tzo client so it doesn't override it
again).

See if it then works- If you want to contact me via email directly it may
prove faster- I've run xitami, and about everything under the sun with my
TZO setup so I'm sure we could find the issue with a few wacks at it.

This doesn't take into account any mapping you may need to do for ports, but
I'm not sure that's even your issue here.

Jack

Great Timing...

I just installed 2.4d9 on a Windows 98 machine with PHP4, and am
having the exact same problem. I did install Xifusion (along with Cold
Fusion Express), but that didn't fix it either... 

Did anyone happen to find a solution to these problems at all?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [Xitami] Dynamic IP... is anyone else using it? --> PASV FTP fails inbound through NAT

PASV FTP FAILS INBOUND THROUGH NAT

To those who may have been following this thread and trying to help me
figure out why I can't get FTP to work with Xitami, thank you. I have had a
lot of thoughtful responses. I think I may have a definitive diagnosis for
why I can't get Xitami's FTP server working properly. As always, your
comments are greatly appreciated...

Currently, Internet Explorer and Netscape have built in FTP clients, but
these clients do not use "normal" FTP. Instead, like most of the newer FTP
clients, they use "PASV FTP" which appears to have become the standard FTP
protocol. I found an article by Don Kelloway which explains the problem in
detail better than I ever could.

Don writes the following which is available at
http://war.jgaa.com/ftp/?cmd=show_page&ID=ftp_pasv.

Comments? More importantly... solutions?

-Carl.

---
With regards to the difference between PASV FTP and Normal FTP:

Both PASV FTP and Normal FTP work in the same manner for the initial
"Control Channel" connection, which occurs as follows:

The external user allocates two port numbers for the FTP session.  The first
port number is reflected in the connection that's used to TCP port 21, on
the FTP server.  This is referred to as the "Control or Command Channel".
The usage of the second port number allocated by the external user, as well
as how the connection is established is where the difference occurs...

If the external user sends the FTP server a PORT  (Normal FTP) command,
which also contains the second allocated port number inside the data of the
packet.  Then the FTP server initiates the next connection to the external
user.  This occurs from TCP port 20 (on the FTP server) to whatever the
allocated second port number is.  This is referred to as the "Data Channel"
connection.

If you've noticed, it's the FTP server which initiated the connection
outbound, to the external user.  In the world of security and firewalls,
this can be a very bad thing.  Hence, the reason why PASV FTP was created.
This is also a reason why some FTP servers do not accept the PORT command.

If the user sends the FTP server a PASV (PASV FTP) command, then the FTP
server responds back to the external user with a port number that it has
allocated.  SPECIAL NOTE:  The port number to be used, AS WELL AS the FTP
server's IP Address is embedded inside the data of the packet sent to the
external user.

When the user receives this packet, the external user initiates the "Data
Channel" connection from its second allocated port number, to the IP Address
and port number provided from the FTP server.

See the difference?  In a PASV connection, the "Data Channel" is
initiated/created by the external user.  In a Normal connection, it's
established by the FTP server.

Note: All web browsers use PASV FTP as its means of FTP.  Although I have
heard a rumor that Internet Explorer 5.0 will support both.  I have yet to
confirm this...

Now, let's look at the "Special Note"...

To reiterate, in a PASV FTP session, the FTP server tells the external user
what the FTP servers' IP Address is, as well as what port number to initiate
an inbound connection to.

If you're using NAT (Network Address Translation), the FTP server is
probably going to be an IP Address within the established "Private Range"
(although that really isn't the issue).  Now, say for instance the FTP
server is 192.168.100.10 and an external user is trying to initiate a PASV
FTP session to this FTP server.  Because the IP Address 192.168.100.10 as
well as the port number is embedded inside the packet and because a lot of
NAT implementations cannot "rewrite" this information.  The external user
receives this information and will try to initiate the "Data Channel"
connection to an IP Address (192.168.100.10) that will never leave their
local LAN.  Hence PASV FTP fails inbound through NAT.

This wasn't needed for PHP 4.0.4pl1 but is needed for 4.0.6. Don't know

Figured out that the offending line was a GSL line that said
<A href='/discussion/$(name)/index.xml' TITLE='Click 
Here'><h2>$(Title)</h2></a> 

If I remove the TITLE='...' and have
<A href='/discussion/$(name)/index.xml'><h2>$(Title)</h2></a> 
it works no problem at all!

The only thing I can think of is that I have a XML object with an 
attribute the same  name as a HTML tag causes trouble...

you will notice, i suspect, that you have huge chunks of binary data in your

First things first, there is a _long_ thread about SSI and Xitami in the list
archives. You may find the answers to your question there.

Second, remember, 2.5b5 is a _beta_ release, with built-in SSI support. The
possibility of something not working is something you take the responsibility
for when you decide to try it.

Try running 2.4d7 or 2.4d9, the SSI support is included via a Perl script, but
it does work.

I have to agree.
I'm running 2.5b5 on win2k and ssi works just fine.

In fact i went to this version after trying several of the latest release
versions and failing to get ssi to work in them, including the service
version.

I'm using ssi with Xitami 2.5b5 on windows 2000, and it works fine here, 
without even installing the perl-stuff.

Some ideas:

Does the page testssi.ssi work on your machine? 
(http://localhost/testssi.ssi), if so, ssi is set up correct and working 
(ssi should be working by default).
If not, check whether it's enabled in your defaults.cfg, the correct 
settings are: (from the xitami.cfg file)

[Ssi]
     enabled=1
[Wsx]
     .shtm=xixssi

Is the path of the included file correct? Put the include in the same

Message-ID: <1367.719T47T10331643rachael_@gmx.net>

there seems to be a root exploite in xitami v2.4d9, seems as a user
can force access to the home dir of the user running the server. 
the upload dir was defined in the ftpdirs.aut as having PUT and 
make new directory rights, but somehow this person manage to
have read access from a subdir.

I have include a small part of the access log file

doesnt look like an exploit for me from what I see from the logs. Anonymous 
user just creates some subdirs and puts some crap into it. Annoying but not 
dangerous.

Then how can something in the /upload dir suddenly become readable when
the ftpdirs.aut read:

[pub/upload]                                                                    
Anonymous=PM

the problems aint that someone uploades something but that the /upload dirs
suddenly becomes readable for an anonymous user, seeems as xitami dont 
check the access rights in ftpdirs.aut as it should.

here's the PHP-side fix:

Well if yout have ftproot/pub for anonymous and
ftproot/upload for upload (two separate directories with no links 
between them) then the problem goes away.

This isn't a bug it a feature (sort of). Basically Xitami inherits 
permissions from the parent specified and by means of the method of access.

In your case you appear to have defined pub/ as G and pub/upload/ as PM. 
Unfortunately this means that because you can get to pub/upload from pub 
the permissions from pub also apply to pub/upload.

You antisocial TWAT!

There was ONE person asking for this code: you should have sent it direct
to him (after FIRSTLY verifying that he was happy to receive a binary
file from you).

NEVER EVER send binaries to the thousands of people on a mailing list, or
the hundreds of thousands of newsservers carrying a newsgroup.

I'd complain to NTL World about your abuse of the Internet, except that
they are as clueless as the majority of their customers, and wouldn't
know how to pick up a cluebat, let alone apply it.

You could try to hold the IP number off from xitami by including the

On this list we frown on personal insults as much as we frown on
attachments, so please keep that in mind in future.

And yes, posting attachments to mailing lists is Not The Done Thing
(tm), and tends to get people annoyed (including the list
administrator).  If it's something only for one person it is far far
better to send it directly to that person.

Finally yes, I'm still alive.  Just struggling to catch up with all the
things I'm supposed to be doing.

I recently upgraded my OS from Windows 98 to Windows
2000.  Well I installed Xitami and simply copied over
all my config files so I wouldn't have to reconfigure
everything.  Well everything worked fine except for
the ability to access one of my hard drives through
Xitami.  Currently I have an alias that points to D:/,
this hard drive holds Windows 2000 on it.  But when I
go to access this alias I get a 403 error, not
authorized to view this webpage.  Is there any way to
get around this by changing something in Windows 2000
or Xitami?

I had this problem as well.  Same thing on windows XP.  I'll be d:\ is the
drive that Xitami is installed on, right?  For some reason it can't see
the root of the drive it's installed on.  What I did was share the drive,
map it to a new drive letter (x:\), and set the path /d to point to the
mapped drive x:\.  So, essentially you're still seeing drive d:\.  It
works for me.  Hope it helps.

BIG BIG SECURITY HOLE HERE IF YOU AREN'T CAREFUL

Are you SURE you want to do this?

If you set aliasses like
     DDD = "d:/"
where D: is the drive that Xitami is instaleld on then you are asking 
someone to look at http://hostname/DDD/Xitami/defaults.cfg and 
http://hostname/DDD/Xitami/defaults.aut which means that you will show 
the world your configuration settings. If you've been really sloppy and 
allowed FTP to see http aliases then someone could put a trojan in place 
of your webserver by doing put ftp://hostname/DDD/Xitami/Xiwin32.exe 
trojan.exe

I don't want to be alarmist here but what Xitami is doing here is makign 
sure that you don't accidentally open up a huge security hole. This is 
GOOD and you really need to think about whether you actually want that 
hole to exist before trying to work around it!

BTW if Xitami is in C:\xitami and you share d:\ where d:\ is where you 
installed Win2k/XP thats still not the smartest thing to do since that 
allows people to see d:\winnt which has a lot of interesting information 
in it and again the potential for someone to upload a trojan exists.

Thanks for the advice Francis, but I don't need to
worry about the security hole.  The only reason I have
it accessing the main hard drive like that is so that
I can get any file from my system while I am at home. 
That alias is IP restricted and user/pass restricted
too, so I doubt anynore but me is going to get in.

i dont know weather or not this is the same problem but i have been using
cuteftp1.8 for a few years now and it has worked quite hapily.

i saw no problem when i moved from nt to 2000.

however a few months back i statted seeing only some or none of the dirs on
a drive or in a folder.

after much checking of  settings etc i discovered that simply upgrading to a
newer version of cuteftp fixed the problem.

Other than that you may have chosen "change to ntfs" when you were
installing 2000 and find yourself with one drive having a fat partition and
one drive being protected by the ntfs protection where permissions are
required.

Just a 'by the by'. Take a look at smartftp (download from www.smartftp.com)
I've tried CuteFTP,
LeechFTP and WS_FTP and have found none of them as satisfying to use as
smartftp. Also
smartftp is free unless you care to make a donation.

Hi,

Does anyone know if it possible to use the server-side GSLgen built in to
v25 with post variables. It works with get variables but I would like to
send more data than this permits, without resorting to cgi if possible.

Sorry, found out how to do it myself. GSLgen inherits the cgi environment,
so all the variables passed to the script are in the environment variables
FORM_xxx (xxx being the name of the variable), and these can just be used
'as is'.

Need to make sure I've got enough environment space for it all now....

Subject: [Xitami] GSL &(symbol); expansion feature
Message-ID: <3BFBCD79.6040102@freesbee.fr>

This is more of an FYI than a bug report or question...

I can't see this documented but some experiemntation and subsequent 
source code examination (smt/formio.c - put_textual() line 850 ish) 
shows that Xitami/GSLgen will replace &(symbol); with the actual symbol 
during its symbol expansion if symbol is gt , lt , amp or quot. So any 
xml file with &gt; , &lt; , &amp; or &quot; will ouptut <>&" into stdout 
(or wherevere the output is).

Thus if you have a tag
<From>
Francis Turner &lt;francis.turner@freesbee.fr>
</From>

and the script has a line
From: <a href="mailto:$(->From:)">$(->From:)</a>

the output text is
From: <a href="mailto:Francis Turner 
<francis.turner@freesbee.fr>">Francis Turner 
<francis.turner@freesbee.fr></a>

and not as I would have expected
From: <a href="mailto:Francis Turner 
&lt;francis.turner@freesbee.fr>">Francis Turner 
&lt;francis.turner@freesbee.fr></a>

This is good because you can embed html tags within your XML files e.g.
<Contents>
a line of text with a &lt;href='/'>link to the top&lt;/a> in an XML tag
</Contents>

but leads to some interesting required gymnastics if you want to put the 
sequence &(symbol); on the page yourself to keep the users browser 
happy. Going back to the earlier From tag example - if you want to display
Francis Turner &lt;francis.turner@freesbee.fr>
so that the users browser actually displays the email address the tag 
contents needs to be
<From>
Francis Turner &amp;lt;francis.turner@freesbee.fr>
</From>

Share and Enjoy

Francis

Subject: [Xitami] Problems setting up xitami behind Roadrunner ISP
Message-ID: <008d01c172b7$eb955aa0$b61e2341@concentric.net>

Hello,

This is my first post to the Xitami list.

I am having a problem configuring Xitami to work behind the Roadrunner ISP.
I can get FTP to work on port 21 if I leave Xitami at its defaults, but
since Roadrunner blocks incoming port 80, I had to adust the portbase to
55000 to use port 55080 with allows HTTP to work.  The problem is that I
cannot get FTP to work at port 55021.

So, I tried adjusting the FTP port varible to -54979 to get FTP port 21
again.  But this does allow FTP to work either.  I also tried adjusting the
data-port variable to -54800 to get the data port back down to 200.  This
also does not work.

Is portbase adjusting something else that needs to be readjusted for FTP to
work?  Does anyone have any ideas?  I really need both FTP and HTTP.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Jay Aldrich

My Xitami server crashed yesterday after and I have no
reason why it did.  I am running Windows 2000 with two
http servers running on the same computer.  One on
port 80 and one on port 9080.  The one on port 80
stopped working while the one on port 9080 is still
running.

I found this line in the crash log.

Abort at smtsock:Send-Timeout-Event-To-Self:

Anyone know what this means in English terms?

Did you setup xitami to run php ?

in defaults.cfg:

[Filter]
    .php=D:\path\to\php.exe
    .php3=D:\path\to\php.exe

when you installed PHP 4, did you tell it to automatically set it to
configure xitami, it was built in with the installation? If not, uninstall
PHP4, then re-install it and set the configuration to xitami.

Using the filters I was not able to configure xitami. I had php4 on my 
system since 1 year. was using apache. I wanted to try out xitami which is 
said to be very fast.
I have managed to get php to work using the isapi addon available at the 
site, which uses php4isapi.dll to run it but still there is one problem if 
I use

print<<<END

html code here

END;

it doesn't work. gives parse error, it used to work on apache :-/

i installed it yesterday no probs, but 1 thing i did do, i put the php
scripts in the cgi-bin (dont ask y) and i got the file download screen.A

lso did you install using the advanced install or the standard (standard is
default), if you didnt do it thru advanced it wont be associating itself
with the file extension (by default it only associates itself with php not
php3 or php4)

Hi all:

Ok, is anyone interested in helping to develop a control panel type application in
PHP for Xitami?

Here's the situation, I currently run 5 domains + 15 sub domains on my xitami
server. Managing these have become cumbersome and creating new ones are not much
easier ( I often have to directly edit the defaults.cfg file). Also if you want to
allow people to manage they're own domains/subdomains as well as do checks on
billing and what not then it becomes equally difficult since xitami doesn't support
these features.

I would like to start developing a PHP driven applet (perhaps with mysql as a
backup for additional information) to replace the current web administration
system. I am also thinking of adding such features as management for php and mysql
databases and perhaps even future billing systems.

Anyhow, before I start, would anyone be interested in this when I'm done, or
perhaps would be interested in helping me develop this system. It would primarily
be for Xitami on the windows platform but I'm sure I could make it more modular in
the future.

For those interested in helping out here's what I'd like to get from you:

1) A list of specific functions and/or features that the system must support
2) Any graphical or user interface ideas
3) Language considerations (PHP, ASP, whatever)
4) Database support if needed and what database

5) Ideas on how to build a system to prevent multiple users from overwriting
each others data since there is only 1 defaults.cfg file.
I'm currently thinking of storing all data in a database and when changes are
made to commit all changes to the database and then import the defaults.cfg file
and re-write the entire file from the database. However, this would mean that
you could not use the Xitami admin html screen to modify the settings.

PHP ofcourse :) Its fast, robust and has quite a lot of utility
extensions.

eh> 4) Database support if needed and what database

I'd recommend using PostgreSQL, but MySQL will do too.

Ok, so here's the deal the official name of the project: PHPTami (if
that sounds ok to people). This will now be an open sourced project fro
any of those interested.

Official site: http://phptami.place-designs.com/

I will update the site as the project continues. For those wishing to

we're hosting about 80 domains with a slightly modified xitami
under OS/2 w/o problems. new domains are created by a small
rexx-script and copy & paste.

maybe it is a good idea to create a PHP frontend, but in this
case you'll destroy the userdefined structure of the configfiles
also.

Subject: [Xitami] File locking problems
Message-ID: <3BFE65C4.1090906@freesbee.fr>

I am creating a dynamic web system where html (and xml) files are 
generated by perl cgi scripts and they are displayed using Xitami as 
static objects once  created.

Unfortunatley I think I've found a race condition, which causes Xitami 
to crash. The condition occurs when a static XML file includes a second 
file (using .xml from XXX or .literal from XXX) and the second file gets 
deleted or renamed just as its being read.

The problem is I don't know how I can lock a file in order to delete it 
(or rename it).

This doesn't happen very often and its very hard to make occur 
frequently so this is speculation, but I can't think what else is 
causing these occasional crashes. I'm wondering if it is something to do 
with the fatc that the perl script that does the deletion is running as 
a child of Xitami because it is called by CGI. Indeed it could be that 
the problem is that the CGI script is inable to delete/rename the file 
but I don't think so since I check the return codes - also the crash 
reports from Xitami and mention xixxml .... (though I did get one crash 
which just produced a dialog saying Microsoft Visual C++ has encountered 
an unrecoverable error with no log)

The system is win2000 sp1 + many security fixes

The crash log reports look like this if anyone can explain them

23/Nov/2001:11:45:14 +0100 Xitami v2.5b5
Abort at xixxml:4: (2, 7)
23/Nov/2001:11:45:14 +0100 Xitami v2.5b5
Abort at xixxml:4: (2, 7)
23/Nov/2001:11:45:14 +0100 Xitami v2.5b5
Abort at xixxml:4: (2, 7)
23/Nov/2001:13:54:39 +0100 Xitami v2.5b5
Abort at xixxml:4: (2, 7)

If anyone has some bright ideas about how I might debug this further 
and/or work around it I would appreciate it!

Francis

PS yes I know 2.5b5 is BETA code. but it has been remarkably stable 
other than this issue and even this one seems to be RARE!

cheaper) and i would like to know how to do this.

what is this?

I am confused ot the purpose of [Stats], anyone care to explain?? Thanks.

Message-ID: <LAW2-OE754yp8ARf3sl0000224f@hotmail.com>

I have problems that seem unresolvable with xitami, but for now, I'm OK (
[the obligatory] ).
I've done searchs online for a program that does what I've put below, but
none can do it.  I've asked people I know and people I don't know, who are
programmers, but no one can do it.  I am positive that there are no windows
programs that do what I have put below, and if anybody knows of any, let me
know.
Here are the program specs:
A simple windows program that counts the number of packets sent out from the
computer.  Also:
-It will save the number of packets to a file, which it saves when it is
closed and loads when it is launched.  This allows for a cumulative count
over many sessions and days and weeks and so on...
-A "reset" button, in order to reset the counter would be nice too.
-Make sure it has digit grouping...it should say "1,592,509" not "1592509".

If you can help me, email cooladam@hotmail.com

as any other subdomain too: you define the subdomain in your DNS (like os2.harddiskcafe.de, www.harddiskcafe.de, ftp.harddiskafe.de) and create an entry in the [Virtual-Hosts] section of the xitami configuration.

os2.harddiskcafe.de=c:\www\vhosts\os2.harddiskcafe.de\vhost.cfg

in this vhost.cfg you define the differences in the configuration:

[Server]
    ipaddress=62.159.157.34
    webpages=c:\www\vhosts\os2.harddiskcafe.de\htdocs\
[AccessLog]

While it is an issue (and has been in the FAQ for quite a while), the
situation that was discussed on Bugtraq (leading to a local root
exploit) requires:
- the plain text password file
- insecure permissions on the plain text password file
- an untrusted user with local access (web admin is local only by default)
- the webserver to be run as root

Having a plain text password in the file isn't ideal, but the combination
of untrusted local users, not checking the permissions on the file
containing the password, and running the server as root definitely don't
help either.

Xitami can be run as a non-root user (with a slight decrease in
functionality, or with the assistance of port redirection in the OS);
either started as root and have Xitami change to a non-root user (the
setuid functionality; but then the "restart" features in Xitami won't
work), or run on an off-numbered port (ie not port 80).  (If the OS
supports port redirection you can redirect port 80 to another one that
a normal user can bind to, and run Xitami on that port.)

The most direct step if you can't trust your local users is to change
the permissions on the password file to 0400 or 0600 (with the owner
being the user that runs Xitami), or to disable the web-based admin.
I typically do both on systems where I'm particularly concerned about
security.

Thanks for this, and thanks for your post to Bugtraq.  I do plan to
make my own post to Bugtraq -- but I'm still busy trying to catch
up with everything that needs to be done this week.  (And this issue
while obviously important, has a number of obvious workarounds, so is
less urgent than some of the security issues with other (non-iMatix)
products I've been dealing with today.)

But seriously, if you do not control local read and write access to 
any server (not just Xitami) then it is you who are the weakest link.  

This is not a Xitami issue but one of protecting idiots from 
themselves.  At this level of inadequacy it's better to just let 
Darwinism cull the flock.

Subject: [Xitami] Multiple copies of messages
Message-ID: <200111291233.BAA17270@pagoda.in.naos.co.nz>

Hi Folks,

Well it appears that the Xitami mailing list got rather upset at someone
mentioning there was a problem with Xitami, and decided to retailiate :-)
(For those that missed out, it started sending out copy after copy after
copy after... of the same message Bernd Luevelsmeyer <bdluevel@heitec.net>
conerning a post to the Bugtraq mailing list about Xitami.)

Seriously, it appears that the mailing list software that we're using
and the iMatix mail server had a violent disagrement about the meaning
of a error message, which led the mailing list software to keep resending
the same message over and over again, even though the mail server
already had plenty of copies of the message which it was going to send
out real soon now and was just trying to say it wasn't going to be able
to send it immediately.

I _think_ I've found the original cause of the problem and put something
in place to stop it happening again, but I'm not sure why it would have
caused the behaviour to happen so unfortunately I'm not 100% certain
I've fixed the problem yet.

My apologies to everyone who got 5, 15, 30, or more copies of the same
message in their mailbox from the Xitami list.  I stopped as many as I
could (there were up to 100 more waiting to be sent out), but I've
received about 30 of them, and I think a few others got more.

Actually that wasn't Bernd's fault: "to err is human, to really screw
things up takes a computer".  See my message (which should get to you
soon; my copies finally turned up) about how the mailing list software
got upset, and sent everything out multiple times.  :-(

I think most of it has been cleaned up now, but there still seem to be a
few little niggles left to sort out.

Handing it off to the OS would be most helpful for the FTP part,
where user really do log in. Xitami also should impersonate the user
then, so the OS will check file accesses automatically.
This is not easy, though, firstly there may be several user logged
in but you can only impersonate one of them, and secondly this is
highly OS specific but Xitami ought to be portable. For this reason,
I don't recommend using the FTP part at all on FreeBSD, but instead
use the server that comes with the OS anyway.

If Xitami runs as a specific user, and only that user has read
permission on the file, then the clear-text things are no problem
IMHO. Just make sure Xitami as a web browser of FTP server or CGI
owner can't be tricked to deliver the file to clients. The problem
is, per default the file is world-readable and Xitami runs as root.

On FreeBSD I made Xitami to install unconfigured and it won't start
automatically. So I left the issue for the admin to clean up: invent
a xitami-user, write defaults.cfg and defaults.aut, provide file
permissions, and set up the autostart-at-boot thingy. It's perhaps
not fair, but technically nobody is in any danger by this install
routine. I've not made up my mind exactly how to change it, but will
somehow do a more complete automatic install; perhaps let it run as
user "nobody" and provide a very restrictive defaults.cfg (only HTTP
and no remote administration).

Greetings -
I'm in the process of migrating my own domain off if IIS/ASP/Access and onto
Xitami/PHP/MySQL.  My server platform will remain win2k server.  So far I have all three
working but I've hit some isues with Xitami that I have not found resolutions for.
I cannot for the life of me get PHP to work in an aliased director. I have tried using 
straight php and I get blank pages returned.  I tried XiFusion and it generated the error message
"Cannot spawn child process".  So my questions are:
1. Can Xitami support PHP using aliases.
2. Can Xitami support PHP using DNS based vitual hosting (I need to host 3 domains on one IP address)
3. Recomendations on how to run Xitami so it is not running as the system account.  Just create a basic user like IIS does and give 
that user access to only my WWW directories?

Thanks for any help and sory if these are repeats.  I'm new to the list and I could not find a way to seach the archives for answers.

The php program searches through some large text files, I'd like to have the text files loaded in memory so they don't keep being read from disk during each query.

How large? Are you sure they are actually being read from disk? 

In unix and Windows, most available memory is used as disk cache. If you
have enough RAM to avoid thrashing, the second third etc time you read a
file that hasn't changed on disk, it usually comes from cache rather
than from physical disk.

You could test this by adding code to grab the time when the program
starts and is done, compute the difference, and write that at the bottom
of the search report. If I'm right, the very first time each day (or
re-boot, or RAM-overload) that it runs will be seconds, each subsequent
search will be milliseconds.

You might also grab the time before and after the file read and before
and after the search process, if they are two phases. In VB, a
case-sensitive search turned out to be FAR slower than any disk-work. 

I'm also sure that for VB and Perl, the interpreter start-up takes
longer than about any code I can write in a month. 

LRWP is a good idea, but hard to get working. Be sure you need the speed
and that it will really help before you go to that extreme. Many massive
sites work fine with plain CGI.

Assuming y0u have one IP address for the server.

Set up Xitami or IIS to use a different port than the default of 80.
The to connect to that server you'd use this url:

http://<name or IP of your server:<port of server>
In my case I'm doing just that until I get my site moved off of ASP and onto PHP.  I run Xitami on port 8080 so I connect to it like this:  http://63.146.67.100:8080

Bob,

If you look through the code in the php 'sapi' (Server API) directory you will
find the code to build a fastcgi version of php. Given that lrwp is simpler than
fascgi and that Xitami provide an easy to use lrwp libray it should be a fairly
simple task to impliment an lrwp version of php.

Good luck !

Scott,

The 'php returns a blank page' comment is a dead give away - this is usually
because php.exe loads but is unable to load php4ts.dll. The most common solution
is to put php.exe and php4ts.dll into the xitami directory. This appears however
to be problematic with aliases. The solution for my problem was to place an
entry in the  system path that points to the php directory instead of moving the
php exe and dll. I also experimented with placing the dll in the winnt\system32
directory.

I think this will solve your questions 1 & 2.

If you wish to run Xitami with a particular account. Install Xitami as a
service. Then open the services control applet and open the service editor and
set the account name and password to run the service - this is standard windows
NT/2000 stuff.

Best of luck

Paul

Greetings -
I'm in the process of migrating my own domain off if IIS/ASP/Access and onto
Xitami/PHP/MySQL.  My server platform will remain win2k server.  So far I have
all three
working but I've hit some isues with Xitami that I have not found resolutions
for.
I cannot for the life of me get PHP to work in an aliased director. I have tried
using
straight php and I get blank pages returned.  I tried XiFusion and it generated
the error message
"Cannot spawn child process".  So my questions are:
1. Can Xitami support PHP using aliases.
2. Can Xitami support PHP using DNS based vitual hosting (I need to host 3
domains on one IP address)
3. Recomendations on how to run Xitami so it is not running as the system
account.  Just create a basic user like IIS does and give
that user access to only my WWW directories?

Thanks for any help and sory if these are repeats.  I'm new to the list and I
could not find a way to seach the archives for answers.

Are you trying to host 2 domains or two sub sites like this: www.yourdomain.com/siteA and www.yourdomain.com/siteB
To host domians you would use the Virtual Host configurations and setup a DNS based virtual host (vs an IP based) in the admin browser. To create the two subsites 
you would use the aliases configurations in the admin browser.

The short version. :-)

If you want to run two or more virtual-hosts off of a single IP address you
are going to have to use name based v-hosts. It is really a lot more simple
than it seems.

The first thing you need to do is create a configuration file for each v-host.
The easiest way to think about the configuration for each v-host is that the
configuration file is a defaults.cfg for _each_ host. Then in your
defaults.cfg you put a pointer/reference for the v-host configuration to that
file.

I'm going to use one.domain.com and two.domain.com in this example. The
_bare_minimum_ CFG file for each v-host is below:

---one.domain.com.cfg--start--
#*END

[Server]
    Defaults=defaults.cfg
    Webpages=one
    Hostname=one.domain.com
---one.domain.com.cfg--end--

---two.domain.com.cfg--start--
#*END

[Server]
    Defaults=defaults.cfg
    Webpages=two
    Hostname=two.domain.com
---two.domain.com.cfg--end--

Then in your defaults.cfg you'll need to add the [Virtual-hosts] section (note
the spacing at the beginning of each line):

--
[Virtual-hosts]
    One.domain.com=one.domain.com.cfg
    Two.domain.com=two.domain.com.cfg
--

The web files for one.domain.com would go in \xitami\webpages\one and for
two.domain.com in \xitami\webpages\two.

You'll also want to look into creating a basehost.cfg, which can be found in
the documentation here:

  http://localhost/xitami/index8.htm

Good luck! I hope this helps.

Xitami excels at name based virtual hosting. I'm running over 25 (at last
count) here with _zero_ problems what so ever.
