Hello, I would like to use Xitami as well as war-ftp server.  This =
server uses port 21 even if it is installed after Xitami.  If I used the =
tips in the FAQ, to change the portbase so that I could use another port =
for Xitami, it also change the http service port.  Consequently, my =
Intranet page does not open and I can not reach my server via internet.

How can I change ftp service port without changing http service port.=20

Thank you
Daniel

Set your part-base back to the default and add this to your defaults.cfg:

[Ftp]
    Enabled=0

This will disable the FTP service in Xitami..

You can either tell Xitami not to run the FTP service at all (since it
sounds like you don't need it as you have a separate FTP program):

[FTP]
  enabled = "0"

Or you can change the FTP control port to something other than 21:


[FTP]
  port=XXX

Probably disabling the FTP service is the most appropriate way to go.

Is is possible to have 2 ftp servers to run at the same time and have Xitami
to run HTTP service on port 80 and FTP service to run on another port than
21?

Thank you

I think that when you are in your default-Ftp
Configuration it tells you toward the bottom what port
your ftp connection is on.  I'm pretty sure that you
can change that and just use a different ftp server on
that port or another port.

I would like to know where I can get the program that
tells the server what to do with a perl or cgi script.
 I have been told and have experenced that when you
get ready to run a cgi through an http it comes up to
be an Internal Server Error can someone help me?

You don't need an external program to tell Xitami how to
handle scripts.  All you need is Perl (or the interpreter for
whatever scripting language you use) and make sure that
Xitami is setup properly.  I've been running perl scripts with
Xitami as my web server for a little under two years with no
problems.  If you're sure you have those things installed
correctly, make sure the script has no syntax errors in it;
check your cgierr.log file to make sure.  Hope this helps.

I have figured it out, all the time I had active perl
but had no idea how to use it.  When I went to specify
where the perl program was I didn't know that it was
to be found with an extention of perl.exe thanks you
for helping me.

Yes.  Change the FTP port setting:

[FTP]
  port=NNN

in your defaults.cfg.

You can tell Xitami not to start its FTP server, and then run another:

[FTP]
  enabled = "0"

But you'll have to run the other one yourself; Xitami won't do it
automatically.

Sounds like you need a perl interpreter:

http://www.perl.com/

Install it in c:\perl under Windows; you'll be glad you did.

Hi,

I'm building a small intranet, for my company and i'm using
Php-Xitami-Access under windows NT(4).
Everything worked fine, when using with PWS (just for testing). After
migrating to Xitami, the problems start to begin: first, it was php =
problems
(i thought) then i realized that the problem was in this instruction:
header("location: blabla.php"). Then, running phpinfo(), realized that =
the
variable HTTP_SERVER_VARS["PATH_INFO"] had no value. (it has a value =
using
PWS)
tried to put a "/" into all header functions and it worked "almost" =
fine...
except the cases where i have my php files under sub-folders... somehow =
it
causes some problems with session variables (???) - lost all of them - =
and i
can't figure out why.
Tried everything i could imagine... and still no luck...

Could someone bring some light to this problem?
Thanks in advance.

Its a bug in 2.5.4 - so its not fixed in that code stream - mind you 
we've been waiting a while for the next version...

I had a question on a perl program, I was trying to
figure out how to use a form which the user puts info
onto a html page and then sends it through perl.  I
need to know if Xitami has a sendmail program or what
I should use to fix the $mailprog = '/usr/lib/sendmail'

No, Xitami is a web server, not a postoffice.

> what I should use to fix the $mailprog = '/usr/lib/sendmail'

Depends a whole lot on what you are running X on. On unix, nearly all versions
come with a mail service and something like sendmail. On Windows.... well,
I've had very little fun auto-sending mail in Windows.

If you're using Windows, you'll need a third party program.  There are
plenty of them around, but talking about them isn't really ontopic for
this list :-)

Xitami just does HTTP and FTP, not sending mail.

Xitam does not have a built-in sendmail program.

I suspect you need

Note I have never used this program in anger

if you're using Windows you need some sort of Command line 
emailer. I guess the common ones are Blat And SendMailNT

Subject: [Xitami] Using perl cgi on NT
Message-ID: <200106041806.LAA10841@eskimo.com>

Greetings;

I have tried every permutation that I can think of and I can't get the
testperl.pl to work. I have ActivePerl very new release and here is the code

	#! d:\PROGRA~1\perl\bin\perl.exe
	print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";
	print "<H1>Hello World</H1>\n";
	print "\n";

It doesn't work with or without the space before d: and it
doesn't work with or without the last print command and it
does display exactly what I think it should when I run it
as a perl script/program in NT.

When I do a view source from my browser I get

	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
	<HTML><HEAD>
	<META http-equiv=Content-Type content="text/html; charset=windows-1252"></HEAD>
	<BODY></BODY></HTML>

Notice the lack of text between the <BODY></BODY> tags!

I am sure it is something simple, but I am not seeing it.

Anybody have any ideas?

Many TIA,
Dennis

Try installing perl somewhere simple, like c:\perl

I had some issues with ActivePerl and NT when it came to long directory 
names, or directories with the ~.

Matt,

Thanks for the suggestion, but that is not an option on my 
system. But you did get me thinking and I persued another path, literally.

It is a perl problem! It does not support spaces in path names.
When I moved my cgi-bin directory to a place where it does not
have a space in the path name it now works just fine! It is still
a long path. d:\xitami\html\cgi-bin

Sounds like a perl bug report is coming next.

Appreciate you getting me thinking on a different path.

Dennis

     I have four Windows machines running inn a LAN through a 10 Megabit
CNET CNIG904B router.  The computers all have
TCP-IP installed but not NETBEUI.  All the computers get their IP address
automatically from the router except one that is running XITAMI as an FTP
and HTTP server.  When I call on the FTP server from outside the network it
is painfully slow.  It takes ten minutes to download a 3.5 Megabyte file
from the FTP server.  The network is on a cable modem and I am calling in
from outside the network from a computer that is also using a cable modem.
Now the network is slow also.  It takes me eight hours to transfer 600
Megabyte from one computer to another on the network..  Any idea what the
problem is?  I realize it's not a XITAMI problem directly but it sure makes
the FTP and HTTP servers almost useless.

what version of windows ?

could you have a dodgy network cable ? are the network calbes less then
90metres long?

TCP/IP should work fine....

Are they 10MB network cards or 10/100MB network cards ?
if so, are they set to auto-negotiation?

Just give the template of a blank directory listing, at least that's how it

Xitami 2.4d9 is now the current production release.  Changes since
Xitami 2.4d7 (Xitami 2.4d8 has been skipped due to version numbering
confusion):

  - A more thorough fix for the "Windows Device Names" denial-of-service 
    problem reported by neme-dhc@hushmail.com to Bugtraq.

  - The Windows GUI and NT Service versions are now open source.  The
    source code is included in the source archives at www.xitami.com.

  - LRWP binary/large files fixes

We strongly recommend sites hosting with Xitami on Windows upgrade to 
Xitami 2.4d9 (after making suitable backups of their existing system).

Xitami 2.5b5 is now the current "beta testing" version that includes 
GSL, a built SSI handler, and more.  Changes since Xitami 2.4b5:

  - A more thorough fix for the "Windows Device Names" denial-of-service
    problem reported by neme-dhc@hushmail.com to Bugtraq.

  - The Windows GUI and NT Service versions are now open source.  The
    source code is included in the source archives at www.xitami.com.

  - LRWP binary/large files fixes

  - The NT Service version should be back "in sync" with the other
    versions, and not suffer from the confusion over "templates or schemas".

Xitami 2.5b5 is NOT recommended for production use.   It is intended
only for experimentation with the new features.  If pain persists, take
two aspirin and call the doctor in the morning.  We have had reports of
problems that will cause Xitami 2.5 to crash, including malformed SSI
pages.  Take care out there.  Look both ways when crossing the street.

However if you want to experiment, we recommend experimenting with Xitami
2.5b5 rather than earlier 2.5 versions.

All your favourite bugs lovingly preserved
------------------------------------------

The updates listed above are the only updates that have been made.  "All
your other favourite bugs have been lovingly preserved" said iMatix CEO,
Pieter Hintjens.  "We had developers working night and day to ensure
your favourite bug survived."

This version is the "fix that Windows device names Denial-of-Service
problem, and get everything back in sync" release.  We hope it will be a
safe "drop in" replacement for the existing versions with no hidden
surprises: if it worked before it should work now, and if it was broken
before it should still be broken now. 

We recommend you make a back up before installing the new version, just
in case.  Computers are good at finding surprises where none existed
before.

Xitami's always been open source, and we welcome contributions of new
features, code, etc.  Some parts of some versions of Xitami are "value
added" extras, and were closed source -- the Windows GUI/NT Service
portions used to be "value added" closed source extras.  But they're now
open source too.

The Xitami/Pro SSL support is still closed source, as the (small)
revenue from it helps fund Xitami development.  But we're trying to make
the source available for as many of the other bits as is practical.

The "ultimate" fix should be Xitami 2.4d9 (just released); this includes
more thorough code to check for Windows device names being opened and
reject them.  Download it from http://www.xitami.com/ and see how you
get on.

If Xitami keeps on serving up webpages like normal, then it's not a
denial-of-service :-)

However it might be a bug.  If I understand you correctly you're saying 
that an (encoded) space as the last element of the path name gives you a
directory listing.  Do you have directory listings enabled?  Which
directory is it that is listed?

Most cable modems I've seen are fast for "downloads" (from the Internet
to you), and slow for "uploads" (from you to the Internet).  This makes
them poorly suited to hosting FTP/HTTP servers.  ADSL has the same
problem.

A common speed for the upload side is 128Kbps, which means 16KB/s.
Okay, if you're just sending a request "get me this", but not okay if
you've got to send a large file.

Your 10-minutes, 3.5MB indicates a speed of about 6KB/s, or 48Kbps.
Perhaps the maximum is 64Kbps; or perhaps your cable is busy.  (With
cable you often share the upload speed with others, and sometimes the
download speed too.)

>I realize it's not a XITAMI problem directly but it sure makes
>the FTP and HTTP servers almost useless.

You can eliminate Xitami from the problem by testing on the LAN; it
should be plenty fast there.  If that's the case, then you need to find
out what upload speed your cable connection has, and maybe try to
increase it.  (With the cable I have, the default is 64Kbps or 128Kbps
upload, but you can get faster upload speeds by paying more.)

Your Perl looks basically okay.  Try checking cgierr.log to see if any
errors are reported from trying to run the CGI.  My guess from your
description is that there will be some reported.

There're no fixes in there other than the ones listed; which includes
your hack for the VHost problem, etc.  Ie stick with your own version
for now.  Basically we wanted to sort out the build system here again
(it was scattered across a few people's PCs, and is now neatly in our
source control system), and fix the Windows DoS.

Also somewhere between 2.4d7 and 2.4d9 (and 2.5b4 and 2.5b5) we've
retired all our OS/2 machines, so don't actually have a way to build an
OS/2 binary!  (Hence the website dosen't have an updated OS/2 binary
version; just updated source for OS/2.  Fortunately due to the
difference in code to handle device names in OS/2 and Windows, the
problem didn't really affect OS/2 much.)

Greetings;

Yes, there were errors in the log. Exactly as I would expect from
what I discovered yesterday after Matt started me thinking in a 
different direction.

Perl is passed the full path to the cgi script, and that had a space
in it. OK for windows, not OK for perl!

And thanks to Xitami's ability to be reconfigured almost as fast as
you can click the mouse, I found out a few other interesting things.

Unlike a well known server Xitami doesn't care what the script name is.
(The other server requires a cgi extension in some configurations.)
And, perl will accept any valid windows path, except for the above
problem ... No Spaces! Verylongdirectorynames and very.long.file.names
cause no problem. There may be a max length path restriction but I
did not encounter it.

Happy Xitami-ing!
Dennis

Hi!

I'm running Xitami 2.5b5 (WinNT service) with Win2kSrv SP2
and I think I've found a bug in new Xitami 2.5b5:

When you try to disable web-based admin by setting
     [security]
     admin=0
in defaults.cfg, it remains fully functional.
You have to set "webmask=" to disable it.

Can someone confirm this bug?

 http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index2.htm -still- says "Current Production
Release - 2.5b4" and links to files like "bs3225b4.exe". The "Vanilla" 
"32-bit Windows console package" version is "bc3225b4.exe"; the "NT service
package" is "bs3225b4.exe"

That's just a bad listing on the Imatix site. If I follow to the directory
these links point to, which is really http://users.skynet.be/sky37432/ , I see
2.4d7

Yes, I'm flushing my browser to see the current pages. 

Guessing the new file names, I tried for
http://users.skynet.be/sky37432/bc3224b9.exe - Not Found. 

So where do I find 2.4d9 ?

AH-HA ! You mean go to http://www.xitami.com, not www.imatix.com ?

There I see 2.4d9; http://users.skynet.be/sky37432/bs3224d9.exe for NT

That's been true for a while. Weren't you around when Ewen and I were taking
about what it takes to compile Xitami under Windows? 

At that time, the GUI and Service frills were not Open, but even I (an utter
C-idiot) was able to compile a version that ran on command and served. And I
was able to make "trivial" changes, compile, and see them run. (Making the
non-trivial change I wanted to try taxed my pea-brain, and I lost interest.)

If Xitami keeps on serving up webpages like normal, then it's not a
denial-of-service :-)

However it might be a bug.  If I understand you correctly you're saying
that an (encoded) space as the last element of the path name gives you a
directory listing.  Do you have directory listings enabled?  Which
directory is it that is listed?

hey,

no more device/device bugs in Xitami!  hurray!

As have been discovered by most Xitami users, we hope
that future bug fixes/releases will no longer have a
bug reporting the wrong version ;-) (v2.5b4 instead of
v2.5b5)

You'll notice I said "are now available from www.xitami.com" :-)

The imatix.com site hasn't been updated yet, and when it is, it's likely
that "Xitami" there will just become a link to the xitami.com site.
(The iMatix site probably won't be updated until the rest of the content
for it is ready, which is still a while off, alas.)

Sorry for any confusion.

I've been hoping that myself for the last several versions.  Alas, there
are too many places where the version number is set (> 1) which seems to
inevitably cause this problem.  One of the things I'm hoping to do is
make all the version numbers come from one place, which should hopefully
simply things.

Meanwhile I've rebuilt the source/executables with 2.4d9/2.5b5 in the
WBA pages and uploaded them.  Anyone who is particularly fussed can grab
the new version.  Otherwise hang onto those "2.4d9/2.4d7" and
"2.5b5/2.5b4" versions -- they'll be collectors items sometime!

Curious.  I suspect there's got to be something with the way that Xitami
is tracking the time (setting an alarm and waiting for a signal in all
the released versions).  Possibly the way this is handled under OS/2 is
more prone to trouble than under some other operating systems.

Is anyone else having trouble with log cycling in 2.5b4/2.5b5 where
there are no "rename error"s mentioned in the log file?

When Xitami "freezes" what is happening?  Is a CGI being started?  From
your description it sounds like you've got a virus scanner checking each
thing that gets run (including CGIs started by Xitami), and perhaps also
ZoneAlarm checking things that are running too.  Given that when you
have these turned off, you don't have the problem, perhaps one or both
of them is intercepting Xitami's attemmpts to run CGIs, etc?

Generally I'd say you'd be better off not scanning things Xitami runs as
they are run, but just scanning the files when you put them on the
machine.  And if you want to run CGIs, you'll have to configure any
security products you might have installed to allow Xitami to start them
automatically.

This happens when downloading a file out of a Xitami-generated directory
listing?  In which case it sounds like Xitami is being a touch too
paranoid about escaping the filenames.

You might want to experiment with changing httpdir.gsl; there are two
versions of each filename passed in: one for display, and one that has
been "escaped" to solve any problem characters.  The latter is used in
the URL by default.  You could experiment with changing it to use the
unescaped name, and see if that avoids your issue.  (It may introduce
other issues though, especially if you have filenames with spaces in
them, etc).

I'll put this on the bug list for more investigation.

".." like strings get eliminated before trying to figure out what the
URL means; it's a security measure.  However there seems to be some
strange interaction between encoded spaces and other things going on;
I've put it on the bug list.

>From what I've heard to date this isn't a security issue (since you
don't get access to anything you'd not otherwise have access to, and
even when you do get a directory listing that perhaps you shouldn't

But it's definitely a strange bug to investigate.

 sounds like a good idea! Thanks. 

 It appears that I'm the only one experiencing problems with any
version higher than 2.47 (on OS/2). With the 'current' beta and the one
including your fix, Xitami would quietly [no error, no popuplog]  stop
running after a [short] while; even without any website traffic. Only
http services are active. This has been tested on two different
machines, both running Warp Server SMP (at FP 42/43). any clues on how
to improve this situation?

if you're doing it on Windows, PHP will set it up for you.
You can choose to have it look for Xitami and configure it.
at least I think. I did it a long long time ago. If not you

I missed your earlier posting, so am having to respond to this one.

Is it wise to retire all OS/2 machines with the renewed interest being
shown in OS/2 as a platform, especially with the release of eComStation?

Subject: [Xitami] Running Xitami as a service under Win9x
Message-ID: <42119@dsl.co.uk>

At work (I teach in a university) we've just decided to set up a class
using Xitami (and InstantASP from Halcyon Soft) to replace an exercise
that used to be done under IIS.

So last week I collected the Windows version of Xitami 2.4d7, and
installed it yesterday (on one trial machine).

The first thought that occurred to me was that it ought to be possible to
run it as a service, rather than just auto-running it once someone has
logged in.  I looked through the FAQ - no mention.  I also saw this
mailing list described, and have been subscribed to it for 24 hours.

I *did* try moving the item that gets generated under the
...\CurrentVersion\Run registry key into ...\RunServices instead, and
indeed Xitami does then start up (although it shows an annoying "about"
screen wwhen so doing).

Then later, I saw that there IS a mention of running it as a Service
under Win9x, oddly enough on the downloads page (I didn't read any
further having once identified the package that I [thought] I wanted:-)

So today I fetched the console version, which has of course been updated
since my FTP session of last week, so I got bc3224d9.exe.  According to
the installation description "The Xitami console version installation
package asks whether you want to install it as a Win95 service".  SFAICS,
it did NOT ask this question; neither did it create "a small dispatcher,
called "C:\Services.bat" which simply changes to the Xitami directory and
then runs Xitami".

Has the installation procedure been botched since those words were
written?  Or has this part never been written after all?

Can I manually create the requisite batch file, and install the registry
key manually (I'm quite happy with registry hacking)?

As an extension, would it be possible to start the iASP admin and servlet
processes from within the same batch file as well?

try the installation instructions in the PHP readme - I found it worked OK
after I remembered to use localhost and my default web directory to hold
pages (otherwise PHP doesn't parse the pages)  - I have just bought
Essential PHP by Julie C Meloni (ISBN 076152729X) and am finding it very
useful.

Ah, but the thing is they've all _been_ retired, as of 6-12 months ago;
it's not like we've just decided to retire them now.

At the suggestion of one of our OS/2 users we've sent a "heads up" to
the makers of eComStation to see if they're interested in working with
us to keep Xitami binaries available for OS/2.  We'll see what comes of
that.

Meanwhile Xitami should build with gcc + EMX under OS/2 for anyone who
is interested in doing so.

And if we can find a spare machine and some spare time (!!) we'll try to
get an OS/2 build machine set up again.  Alas, spare time is in short
supply...

"higher than 2.4d7"?  Did you build your own executable?  Or do you mean
2.5b4?  Currently there aren't binaries for OS/2 for 2.4d9 or 2.4b5
online.

What is in the logs?  If you run it in debug mode ([Server] debug=1)
does it indicate anything happening at the point it stops?

 sorry for not being clear: I was referring to the 2.5b4 and the
patched version made available recently by Bernd Hohmann.

 nothing specific: below is a sample of today:

2001/06/07 11:33:09: Loading VH data for base host
2001/06/07 11:33:09: - loading config data from basehost.cfg
2001/06/07 11:33:09:  - rootdir=webserver, cgi-bin=cgi-bin
2001/06/07 11:33:09: - loading password data from: mrhsrv.aut

 The program quitely closed some time later.
 If there's any specific check that I could do to improve the error
response, please let me know. I'm aware that the current "results" are
not impressive.

i may introduced other bogus bugs. but this version is running
with more than 120 vhosts and 60 ftp-accounts here.

on the other hand: xitami is running in an endless loop because
it crashes sometimes when the ftp-setup of one user isn't
correct but this happens only when the user tries to use its
defect account.

You're trying to set an alias to another harddrive?
hmm...it should work no problem...can you cut that
portion of your CFG file and send it to the list,
maybe we can find something from there.

Matt,

You want something like this:

[Alias]
    Cd = "z:\\"
    Drv/a = "a:\\"
    Drv/c = "c:\\"
    Drv/d = "d:\\"
    Drv/e = "E:\\"

    Drv/g = "g:\\"
    Drv/x = "x:\\"
    Drv/y = "y:\\"
    Drv/z = "z:\\"

Hope this helps!

Good Luck!
Dennis

I really appreciate you help.

I tried what you and Dennis have said.

I put in the forward slash... [/private=e:\] 
... but it still does not seem to work.
I keep getting... "The URL you asked for does not
exist on this website". :(

So as my situation goes, my website runs from the D: drive
and I have files on the E: Drive.

I set up the alias as you said and put in a test file [mapfail.htm]
into my E: drive.

The same message pops up as before. Is there a special way that
I have to set up the link on my webpages? 
i.e. - http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/private/e/mapfail.htm    ?
or    http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/e/mapfail.htm  ?

Thanx guys,

Matt

Hey,

You need to take out those leading # characters. They make it comments.

Put in an entry like this:

     Temp = "E:\\Program Files\\XITAMI\\temp"

You can do this through the admin screen also.

Note that you can call it anything you want. I am still trying to 
figure out how to set up a virtual file system, but that is another thread.

Good Luck!

Dr. Gil,

The First thing you will need to find out is if your DSL provider provides
you with a static or dynamic IP address. If you have a dynamic address, than
you will need to subscribe to a domain redirection service (bn3 is pretty
good). If you have a static IP address you have the option of running your
own DNS server (but with WinME stability could be an issue). If you choose
to run a DNS server, I suggest you buy a book on setting up a windows DNS
server as the process can be complicated and involve some steps that will
not be that easy for someone new to hosting web sites. Personally, if you
are new to this, I would go with a free redirection service like bn3 anyway,
especially if you have a static IP address. With bn3 you can redirect
http://www.yourdomain.com to your IP address and it will work great. If you
have a Dynamic IP address, you really don't have a choice other than to go
with a redirection service like bn3. If you would like to check out bn3's
offering go to http://www.bn3.com

Where ever you got your domain name (www.MyName.com) .. they should have a facility to 
point to a DNS server. They may have their own DNS server IP's as default. I use my SDSL ISP domain.  
I paid for 8 static IP's.
At Register.Com (where I got my domain name), I point to my IP domain name server and I point my Static IP address on one of my boxes static IP here as my web site. 
The router assigns internal IP addresses, as does my ISP. The ISP maps Internal IP's to External IP's, so that TCP/IP can travel on a private network on my side of the firewall. (We have 3 pc's here).
The outside world can get to my machine by my desk via external IP address or domain name.
Do get a firewall; better to run NT. WinXX is unsafe in the real world. WinXX must be behind a firewall. It can't be in the DMZ or you may get hacked.
Get rid of Windows Networking. Only use TCP/IP. NT ships "Wide Open". NT must be locked down. Win98 is wide open and can't be locked down.  If this bumms you out, call M$.
There are some good books out there on NT and TCP/IP and Firewalls. Very interesting reading.
Good Luck. Hope This helps.

Many have answered the need to find your machine via the DNS with static ip's or another service.  I will just mention that I have a static ip and that the isp that registered my domains can point them to my static ip. (Yes thats right I point half a dozen at the same ip).  I then successfully use the virtual hosts in Xitami to pick up the domain name used in the url and serve up different web sites.  If anyone actually types in the numeric ip address then they get the default host pages.  It will work and Xitami has proved an excellant choice as I can now easily add my newly registered domains and have them all on the one server - even separtate log files to count the few people that visit !!!!

Yes I run it all on a Win98 pentium 160 box with 48MB ram and it stays up quite well on this platform.

I trust y'all realise that if you have a comment ("#") character at the
start, Xitami is going to ignore it as a comment?  You need something
like:

[Alias]
   /private=e:\

in order for Xitami to read it :-)

Sadly, I've seen no response to this query :-(

In the interim, I've written a batch file [C:\Xitami\Service.bat] of my
own, containing:
    C:
    cd \Xitami
    XiDOS32 -s
and have edited the relevant [...\RunServices] registry key to have an
additional entry:
    "Xitami" = "C:\Xitami\Service.bat"

This works OK originally: the HTTP server starts running about the same
time as the "Login to Domain" dialogue box appears on the screen.  (I had
to edit the job's properties so that it started minimized, rather than
having a blobby-great DOS-box on the screen.)

The service continues to work happily also after a user has logged in for
the first time.  However, when that user elects to "Start -> Shutdown ->
Close all programs and log in as a different user" then the server
process also gets killed.

This isn't really very useful; surely after having been started with the
-s switch[1] the process ought not to be a candidate for killing off on
user "logout"?

I'm suspecting that we shall have to revert to the bw (Windows version)
and just be content with its being started through the Run key for each
login, and then not have the user logout.

Any information and hints on this aspect would also be appreciated; with
these Java processes, one *can't* logout without running the associated
"Stop" programs.

[1] Yes, it is lower-case, and yes, the box reports "Moving into background".

This is largely because no one knows the answer :-)  Windows 95/98
really are not intended for running services on them; any attempts to do
otherwise are at best somewhat hopeful and as you have found.

Basically from what I've been able to find out any "services" you run
under Windows 95 generally start when you log in, and stop when you log
out, and there's relatively little you can do about that.  Apparently if
you install the NT Service version (bs3224d9.exe) under Windows 95 it
will register itself in basically the way that you have found.

Alternatively you can run the DOS console version in a minimised window
as you have done (the "-s" switch doesn't do anything under DOS/Windows
other than print out the message you saw; it does useful things only in
Unix and OS/2).  However as you've found, it'll be stopped when the user
logs out.

Basically if you'll need to choose between: (a) having Xitami running
when a user is logged in, on a user workstation OS like Windows 95/98,
and (b) running Xitami on a more server oriented OS (Linux, Unix,
Windows NT/2000, even OS/2).

Sorry about that.  But unfortunately it's inherient in the way that
Windows 95/98 works: it's not intended to run "services" in the way
server OSes are, and Microsoft went to some lengths to make it more
difficult.

I just received this mail together with those from Dennis and David,

I was beginning to think that the Xitami list was vested with a certain

When I test this with I get a HTTP_REFERER header available in the
environment (eg, with /cgi-bin/testcgi) if the browser provides it. 
(Generally the browser will provide it if you've clicked on a link to
get somewhere, and it hasn't been configured not to, and there are no
proxies in between configured to strip it out.)

Do you not get that variable?  If so what HTML are you using to provide
the link to click on, and what version of Xitami?

As far as I recall, Xitami passes all HTTP headers through to the CGI
programs as HTTP_..., and in addition sets a few other variables (from
the CGI spec, and forms).

As far as I can remember this message will appear only if Xitami detects
the path as a WSX (web server extension, like the admin pages), but 
then cannot find the extension that is supposed to be there (eg, because
the name is wrong).

The [Wsx] section of the config file specifies that "admin" should be
handled by "xiadmin"; if you've changed your config files (eg,
defaults.cfg, etc) for some reason so that "admin" points at another
name that might cause the problem.  So perhaps check carefully through
your defaults.cfg file.

The 501 (not implemented) error message indicates that there is no
"xisetup" that can be run.  AFAICT this is because there is no
"xisetup"; the web based admin is "xiadmin", usually at "/admin", and is
set up by the default configuration.

You can set up virtual hosts through the web based admin (at /admin).

Which version of Xitami is it? (2.5b4, but dos console? Win32?  NT
Service?)  And how do you have it configured to "run at startup"?  When
a user logs in?  Or before that?

Normally Xitami will find the IP addresses that are available when it
starts, so I'm puzzled by your situation -- possibly it is starting
before an address has been allocated for your network card (eg, via
DHCP)?  Or possibly something strange is going on.

If you were running the NT Service version of 2.5b4 you were possibly
being caught by the old-binary situation, causing it not to find the
script that output the rest of the FTP login sequence.  You might like
to try 2.5b5 and see if that has fixed the problem; it includes a
rebuilt binary that matches the included scripts.

You can't believe anyone; they've all got their own agendas :-)

Seriously, Xitami and "dir" seem to disagree over which timezone they
should be reporting things in, which I suspect is leading to this issue.
I've put it on our bug list to get investigated.

Greetings;

AFAICT Xitami is not passing through HTTP_REFERER to perl cgi's.

I have a perl program that I have used many places that just
dumps out all the variables and HTTP_REFERER is not among them.

When I explicitly display it the value is null.

This perl program is currently working as expected with Apache on
both Sun unix and linux/390 so it looks like it is a Xitami weirdness.
At least on my NT 4.0!

The issue here is that the [security] admin=N setting controls whether
the admin section is even started up, as Xitami starts.  At this point
only the main configuration file (xitami.cfg, defaults.cfg) is
available, and hence the setting is a global setting.  If you disable it
in the main file, then the admin section is never started, so will not
be available under a virtual host or anywhere basically.

As far as I can tell the [security] admin=N setting in the virtual hosts
is never even tested.

What you could possibly do (you'll need to test this with your setup),
is use the [wsx] admin=... settings in the virtual hosts where you don't
want the admin available, to override what the /admin path maps to.
This should cause "the function you requested is not implemented" for
thos virtual hosts.  Providing it does, you can then take the password
section out for /admin for those virtual hosts, and anyone trying will
immediately get that error message.  Then on the virtual host where you
do wish to access the admin, you can use the password section, and not
override the [wsx] admin=.... setting, and it should, in theory, work
there.

Possibly the documentation should be clearer as to what settings are
global and what are per-virtual-host.

Hmm.  Is it just perl CGIs?  Or any CGI?  For instance when I use the
"Test this CGI program" link in the example pages distributed with
Xitami, it shows me the HTTP_REFERER header, both with the executable
CGI, and also when I use a Perl program in its place.  (If you just go
directly to the CGI then there will be no referer of course.)

Can you perhaps send me (off list) the HTML that you use to link to your
perl script, and the environment variables that your perl script does
receive?

I'm puzzled as to how it could be different on your setup from mine
(Xitami under Linux).

>  how to have Xitami recognize my domain name. 

Web servers don't know their own names. (They can, but they don't have to.)

And there are really no names on the Internet, only numbers.

But people prefer to give machines names, because numbers are hard to
remember.

Look at what happens when you type a name like "yahoo.com" at your browser.
The browser says "What do I do with this? I need a number!". But it knows that
the user probably does not know the number. 

What the webserver (actually the TCP network stack) does is ask a DNS server.
All ISPs are required to have a DNS server to serve their customers and to
answer requests for name/number lookups from other DNS servers.

I have a site http://summerfest.rutgers.edu . You are using pbi.net (PacBell?)
as an ISP. Your browser calls pbi.net's DNS server and asks "What's the number
for summerfest.rutgers.edu?" pbi.net's DNS server probably never heard of
summerfest.rutgers.edu, but it heard of rutgers.edu (or it asks a master .EDU
DNS system for the number of rutgers.edu's DNS server). It asks
DNS1.rutgers.edu "what is the number for summerfest.rutgers.edu?" and gets the
answer "165.230.87.130". Your browser opens 165.230.87.130. The Xitami at that
address serves you a page. 

Now, how did DNS1.rutgers.edu know that summerfest.rutgers.edu is a name for
165.230.87.130 ? I called our DNS guy and asked him to add
"summerfest.rutgers.edu", pointed to that IP number, to Rutgers' DNS system. 

Since you have a Commercial ISP, there will be differences. First: is your IP
number Static? My server's IP number has never changed. Many DSL etc accounts
get a new IP number every few days. There are ways to handle Dynamic IP
allocation, but it is trickier and less reliable than a Static IP. Note that
asking your ISP for a Static IP may require that you convert to a more
expensive "business" account!

With a static IP, your ISP should be able to add your hostname to their DNS
system, for all the world to lookup. But at Commercial ISP providers, this
often costs "extra".

And by asking for a Static IP and a DNS entry, you are telling your ISP that
you are running a public server. Such servers -sometimes- generate a lot of
traffic, more than the ISP expects for a "home surfer" account. So they may
bump you up to a more expensive account. 

Technically you can buy DNS service from anyone. There are even "Dynamic IP
DNS" servers that can change your listed IP number almost as often as your ISP
reassigns your IP number. 

You "can" set up your own DNS service, but: (A) this is very geeky stuff to do
correctly (B) some -other- DNS service has to know about your DNS service or
nobody will find your DNS server. You can register your own DNS with InterNIC
(the people who hold your domain name registration) but they like to see two
DNS providers, not in the same place. I don't think this is for a "serious
newbie" as you describe yourself. 

The "right" answer is "Call your ISP and talk". But try to avoid saying who
you are until you find out if this will run up your bill.

FWIW, a colleague of mine tried installing Xitami on some machines in a
teaching lab last year (I don't know which version he was using).  The
machines all worked fine if one logged in to them as "admin", or with
otherwise unrestricted accounts, yet if one logged in with a very
restricted account[1], the server would only respond to the loopback
address, and not to that of the LAN[2].

I'm pleased to say that bw3224b9 does *not* suffer with this problem: it
runs with both the 127.0.0.1 and the allocated 193.63.241.* addresses
quite happily whatever the privileges of the user account.

[1] I've used the System Policy Editor[3] to create very restrictive
accounts to prevent students screwing up the configurations of these
Win95 machines; it works *really* well.  (Of course, it makes it much
easier to prevent these policies being circumvented by having a PDC on
the network too.)

[2] The LAN has fixed, pre-allocated IP addresses: no DHCP involved here.

[3] There have been no changes to the policies between last year's
failures and this year's successes: originally, I had thought that some
part of a policy prevented a server process from binding to, and/or
listening on, any IP address other than 127.0.0.1.

If something is place in the registry key
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run], then
it will be executed (asynchronously) when anyone logs in.  If placed in
the [...\RunServices] key, then it will be executed when Windows first
boots up.  (I make use of the RunServiceOnce key to execute some commands
that configure each machine in the lab, when they've all been downloaded
an identical Ghosted image: works brilliantly.)

What I hadn't appreciated was that something started from the RunServices
key is killed off, like any other program, when a user logs out.  And
there is then no mechanism by which it will be restarted on the next log
in.

Daft, in my book.

Indeed :-(

I have now reverted to running the Win32 version rather than the console
one, and it's fired up when someone logs in.

Incidentally, and this is the main point of this posting, I found that
the file bw3224d9.exe on the Belgian mirror site is corrupted.  Instead
of transferring 700kB, it stops after 68kB (and obviously the resultant
file is not executable: it complains "Corrupt previous installation" and
exits).  I had to fetch this file from the USA site.

TZO has useful utilities which can be used for recognizing your domain name
externally.  You simply run a downloadable DNS client (with "Yourname.com")
on the PC that you are hosting your webserver.  Works well for Mail servers
also.  If interested, they are located at www.tzo.com

Has anyone else had this problem?  I've just downloaded bw3224d9.exe from
the Belgian mirror site and it appears complete to me.  Did the download
time out part way through, or otherwise go strangely?

Ah, that sort of problem.  You might want to keep an eye on whether it's
always at the same point, or whether the problems shift around.  If they
shift around it's most likely that something is writing to memory it
shouldn't.  If it's always (or usually) one place, then possibly there's
something wrong with the way that some requests are handled by smtsock.

Unfortunately either way they're difficult to diagnose problems, since
they're not easily reproducable.

I can't reproduce this with 2.5b5 under Linux; if I set [security] admin=0
and restart Xitami then the admin returns 501-not-implemented.  As far
as I can tell from the source code the Windows NT Service version ought
to behave the same way.

Has anyone else had problems with [security] admin=0 not disabling the
admin service?   (Note, it MUST be in defaults.cfg to work; the setting
is checked only as the webserver starts up.  And the setting is global
to the whole webserver.)

Does this ONLY occur in directory listings via aliases?  Or does it
occur with any directory listing?  My guess is that it would occur with
any directory listing generated by Xitami, and I suspect it is related
to the URL-encoding being done by Xitami.  You can perhaps work around
this issue in httpdir.gsl (in the templates directory), by using "name"
rather than "nameurl" in the links. (This will cause some other problems
though, especially with names with spaces in them.)

If it does occur in all listings it is already on our bug list.  If it
occurs ONLY in directory listings via aliases we'll need to narrow down
what is special about the directory listings via aliases so we can add
it as a new bug.

I've managed to reproduce this with Xitami 2.4d9, but Xitami 2.5b5 does
not suffer from the problem.  I'll put it onto our bug list; thanks for

The dirlist option appears to operate correctly with 2.4d9 under Linux;
if set to "1" then directory listings are allowed, if set to "0" then a
forbidden message is generated.

Beware that there are two dirlist options; one for the CGI directory and
one for the overall server security.  The one you want to disable all
directory listings is:

[Security]
  dirlist=0

The main issue here is that the ServletRunner has no syntax for saying
to Xitami "give me all the files ending in this extension".  In theory
(I haven't tried this) if you can get the LRWP request to be for ".jsp"
then all ".jsp" files should be passed to that LRWP (and with the way
the ServletRunner works, to that servlet).

So if you are up to a bit of Java programming you might be able to hack
the ServletRunner to pass the ".jsp" string across for the servlet that
is handling the JSP files in its (or one of its) LRWP registrations.

Really what is needed is some sort of config file syntax for specifying
this, but that may have to wait until I can merge in the changes to the
ServletRunner that a user sent in.  (Ie, more spare time :-) )

Not that we are aware of.  I suspect that for some reason something is
overwriting a bit of the memory that Xitami is working with, causing it
to get confused and crash like this.  Unfortunately they're very
difficult bugs to track down.

If you do get a chance to try 2.4d9 or 2.5b5 (recently released), I'd
appreciate any comments on whether it is better or worse.  (At least
with those versions I know we've got the source code it was compiled
from safely in our source archive which makes it somewhat easier to
investigate problems.)

You don't say what version of Xitami you are using.  If you are using
Xitami 2.4 you need to use perlssi (as a filter, it should be
preconfigured in the default configuration).  If you are using Xitami
2.5, then xixssi should be installed and set up automatically, in which
case you don't need those [wsx] entries.

In 2.4, the contents of cgi-bin are not directly visible, only
their output is served, as long as you use the default location
(NOT under the webpages directory) and don't set any aliases to
it. 

Don't set "Allow file mixing?" in the CGI settings, if you can
possibly help it.

I'm running Xitami 2.5b5 on w2k sp2.
I've setup RAM drive recently, and consider putting web server pages on it
to speed up access a bit. Is it worth it and are there any limitations?
Also, will there be any advantage of placing Xitami executable on RAM drive
itself (with logs, templates, etc.)?

 From what I can tell, I think someone tried to use holes in
either MS Personal Web Server or IIS to exploit your server.
I'd guess IIS, since they tried to run a command using the
interpreter located in c:\winnt, meaning you were running
Windows 2000 or NT.

61.139.59.73 - - [08/Jun/2001:16:38:03 -0500] "GET http://www.yahoo.com/ 
HTTP/1.1" 404 0

I bet some script was just looking to see if you were running
a web server; if you have a telnet server installed on your
machine, try telnetting into port 80, and type:
GET http://www.yahoo.com
with two CRLFs after it.  This should produce the same error
as this one in your access.log.

And as for the last one, I have no clue, sorry.

Whatever you come up with, I'd be interested to hear about.
Also, everything I said above is just guesses; corrections
and clarifications would be welcome from anyone.

My guesses are:

Most current hard drives are faster than any network that carries other
traffic,

Disk-cache in Windows (and surely unix) will quickly fill with the most-used
files and deliver them at RAM speed. This is a very real effect, I discovered
years ago in DOS when I maxed-out the disk cache. After the first time I
accessed a file, the next time(s) it loaded as if from RAM drive, unless I had
opened more than 8 megs (SmartDrv's limit) of files in the meantime.
 
I think your RAM drive is just taking RAM away from Windows' disk cache. And
Windows' disk cache actually works well, and is probably at least as fast as
the antique code in RAMdrive.

I could see a RAM drive in the case where you have rarely used files that MUST
load quickly. Being rarely used, they will fall out of disk cache between
uses. But with the relative speeds of modern drives and the typical congested
network link, you may not be able to see the difference at the browser.

Actually, the RAM drive resides in non-paged memory pool, therefore the data
it holds is never written to disk except changes to data if any are written
on an hourly schedule.

hi there,

possibly this is a very simple thing but i can't get it set up...

their pages' url result in something like this:

1) how do i setup cgi-dirs for every of those users ?

the 2nd) (i suppose this is the more elegant way)
can i achieve the same with virtual hosts ? and how to setup them,
probably there is an idiot proof instruction manual ? :-)

many thanks in advance for your help!

The main limitation is that obviously you can't keep the master copy of
things on your ram drive, as it will go away when you reboot :-)  Which
means you've got to handle copying things into the ram drive on startup,
and making sure you copy anything you want to keep off before you reboot
(which is a pain if you are forced to reboot without shutting down
cleanly).

As to whether it is worth it, that is a much harder question these days:
modern OS (and W2K is modern enough for this purpose) cache things that
have been read from the disk pretty well.  So that things which are
being used are kept in memory (in the disk cache) even if their
permanent home is on a real disk.

So basically a ram disk is betting that you know better than the OS what
is being used a lot: it certainly used to be true with DOS, but it's
far less true with a modern OS.  Usually the ram is better just left for
the OS to use for caching; but experiment and see what you think.
Remember that ram you take for the ram drive won't be available for
running programs; which if you have limited ram can force the machine to
swap, which is rather... bad.

Set the "cgi anywhere" flag (beware, this is a security risk if you let
people upload their own content: they can upload and run any program
they like on your system).  [CGI] wildcard=1 controls this.

If you can live with urls like:

http://username.example.com/

then you can give each a virtual host.  You can set these up in the
virtual host portion of the web based admin -- and once you've got the
config files for one you'll probably find you can easily replicate them
by copying an existing one and changing the names.  With the virtual
host approach you can give each their own cgi-bin directory, and
webpages directory and so on.

To go along with this line of thinking..

The non-paged memory pool on Win32 platforms is *not* something you want to
run short of. In an earlier message it was stated that the RAM disk was held
in this memory pool. Bad idea, on a high-load server, if this pool runs short
your machine will crash and die a horrible death.

Hmmm... I don't think I even addressed the issue of writing.

And certainly I'm sure you know that a RAM drive doesn't copy to disk by
itself, so I guess you'll be using a timer and script to handle that bit. 

I used RAM drives a LOT, back in MFM days when hard drives were slightly
faster than a telegraph. I'm aware that they are still useful stages for
program compilation, where there is much disk work but only the final result
has to be saved. 

But on a web server, my guess is that disk speed is almost never a limit.

Try it and let us know.

What Ewen says.

Note that this requires additional DNS entries, whereas
www.dummy.com/JohnSmith/ only requires that www.dummy.com be registered in
DNS.   
If you manage your own DNS, no problem. And the username entries can be CNAME
pointers to the one IP entry.

If you buy DNS service from somewhere else, adding hostnames to DNS may cost
you money.

Moreover, the instructions are in the headers of EVERY post on the list;
it's only morons like Linda who send "unsubscribe" requests TO a list

The first two, are exploits in IIS - microsoft's web server, with regards to
uni-code strings.

The 3rd one would be scanning for web proxy's which could be used
anonymously.

The 4th string appears to be what the ftp service logs in xitami when a user
issues an "ls" command. This seems like a confusing way to log this? ewen?

Yes, that's correct.  As far as I can tell what gets logged is:

ftp://YOURIPADDRESS/TEMPDIRNAME/TEMPFILENAME

wher YOURIPADDRESS is the IP address they FTP'd to; TEMPDIRNAME is
whatever name you've told Xitami to use for temporary files (by default
it is "temp" which uses the value of the TEMP environment variable if
set), and TEMPFILENAME is the temporary file Xitami creates with the
directory listing in it prior to sending it.

>This seems like a confusing way to log this? ewen?

The difficulty is that Xitami tries to log these in the same log as the
HTTP requests, and hence needs to make them "distinct" in some way.  And
"ls" type requests don't transfer a real file.

Suggestions for alternatives welcomed.  Maybe it has to be a separate log?

Message-ID: <20010613141457.47235.qmail@web14601.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear All,

I'm using Xitami v2.5b5 on Win98.

I've been looking around quite laboriously for the
past few days on how to get xitami to support ASP.

This is what I discovered:

1) Halcyonsoft Instant ASP (iASP) works with Xitami
and MS Access 2000 (which requires ASP) - read this on
iASP's forum.  BUTTTTTTT ... I can't find where to
download a free version of iASP (i saw free version of
iASP on the net (version 1.08 at cnet.download.com)
but no longer downloadable!

My question:

1)  Are there any other ways of getting xitami to
support ASP and this 'ASP ad-on' will work with MS
Access 2000?

2)  If not, does anyone have the free version (v1.08).
 If yes, could you kindly upload to your XITAMI web
server, and let me know of the URL?

thanks a quadzillion

Is Micro$oft Ever Free? :-) Well good luck on getting Xitami to
support ASP. You do have options though. You could go with a
language more powerful than ASP. Such as ColdFusion or PHP or JSP.
Those are all supported nicely on Xitami. And they are all Free.
There is a Free Version of CF, PHP has always been free and so
is JSP. And for connecting to Access 2000, that should be snap
with any interpreter that supports ODBC.

Ok, Ive got the right information in the right places now.
I have set the Aliases as instructed. (There are no # signs

My final question is this:

How do I link up the info in another drive?

Do I just put an html file in the drive and link to it like this?
    - http://www.whatever.com/dummy.html?

or do I have to specify the drive letter? Everytime I try to do this
Nothing happens or I get a page that says "The URL you asked

Thanks again

  Ok, Ive got the right information in the right places now.
  I have set the Aliases as instructed. (There are no # signs
  before them either :) )

  My final question is this:

  How do I link up the info in another drive?

  Do I just put an html file in the drive and link to it like this?
      - http://www.whatever.com/dummy.html?

  or do I have to specify the drive letter? Everytime I try to do this
  Nothing happens or I get a page that says "The URL you asked
  for does not exist on this website".

  Thanks again

Create an alias that points at that other drive (or preferably a
directory on it), eg:

[Alias]
   mydir=d:\mydir

Then you can use URLs like:

http://www.example.com/mydir/myfile.html

You can't use drive letters directly in URLs.  (And even indirectly you
can use them only in file:/// URLs which work ONLY on your local PC.)

I'm running WIN 98 with Xitami 2beta5 and was
wondering why it is that everyone can view my cgi-bin
all they have to do is http://mydomain/cgi-bin and it
shows them everything thats in there.  Is there a way
to restrict this so people may not see into it but are
able to exitcute cgi programs and perl programs?

I downloaded it (for work) from www.halcyonsoft.com; look for their
"Developer's Edition" which is a 9MB self-installing EXE file.  Only
permits ten concurrent connections.

I am having some problems with this, and am in e-mail dialogue with one
of Halcyon's people.  If anyone else *here* has experience of using iASP
with Xitami under Windoze (I'm using 2.4d9 on Win95C), I'm sure it would
be of interest to Ethereal Being and myself.

(In particular, the two "problems" I've found to date are:
    1) iASP doesn't provide a Content-Length HTTP header on the documents
    it serves up (even if they actually have no dynamic content at all,
    but just happen to have the .asp extension).  This results in the
    client (ie the browser) sitting there awaiting further data, until
    either it or the Xitami server decide to expire a timeout and close
    the TCP/IP channel
    2) I've been unable to instantiate a VBscript object of the RegExp
    class; e.g.
        dim reg
        set reg = new RegExp
    iASP (or something) barfs on the latter, and instead of returning the
    expected HTML, gives a message about being unable to create an
    ActiveX object.
Has anyone else had these, or similar, experiences with iASP?)

One might be inclined to agree; it's very mailing-list-hostile to dual
post in ASCII and HTML.  The latter should ONLY be sent to consenting
adults after prior agreement; mailing lists (and newsgroups, for that
matter) should be sent *plain* ASCII text *only*.

Using 2.4D9 Xitami server,activestate perl,windows ME,cgi enabled.
I am able to execute an image-based counter cgi successfully if I link

But when using SSI call to the cgi inside a .html page the cgi is not
exectuted and no cgierr is generated.
If I change the extension of the same page to .shtml then the page is
not shown and I get a 500 internal server error.  Once again not cgierr
is generated.

Your help is appreciated

Supposedly the archives are located at

discussions (I'm on 10 different mailing lists, so it takes me a while to
realize that my address has been removed by the mail server - mail bounces
on occasion).

It's nice to be back...I see that Xitami's been updated and XiFusion v2.5
finally got added to the add-ons section of the website (that way I don't
have to keep sounding like a broken record :)

Thomas, check out http://xitami.ec-computers.net those are where the archives
are from 1997 to May 05, 2001 before we changed over the list to Xitami.org.

Once I have a little bit of time I will be archiving these up and sending them over
to Ewen to put on Xitami.org's site.

Hi!

Perhaps that info can help:

Before I started exploring Xitami on w2k I used to run GUI version of Xitami
on Win9x,ME (xiwin32.exe). There is the way to start Xitami at pre-login as
a service.
You simply hack a registry a bit. Go to
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\RunServices. Create new
REG_SZ there. Moify it to contain C:\Xitami\xiwin32.exe (or whatever your
path will be). Bingo. Now your Xitami will start early before anyone logs in
and stay running after logout till you shut down.
Limitations: you will have no tray icon, you'll have to ctrl-alt-del/end
task the server if you wish to stop or restart (except wba) the server.

Mike.

That address works for me:

What error did you get when you tried to access them?

As Scott notes, these archives are currently only for May and June this

archives of the older messages when we get a chance.  Meanwhile the old

I'm assuming that you want to run both on the same server, and both
without any special port numbers, in which case your choices are:

(a) run them on different IP addresses, and have the DNS for those
domains point at the appropriate IP address.

(b) have one server forward requests for some domains to the other
server (Apache can do this with mod_proxy; Xitami needs some sort of
add-on, perhaps a LRWP program, to do this).

Of these (a) is somewhat easier to handle, but (b) will work just fine.
However if your reason for running Xitami is to handle "simple" requests
without bothering Apache, then (b) might not be such a good solution.

For just testing, simply running them on different ports is often the
easiest solution.  (Both Xitami and Apache can be told to use different
ports.)

It sounds like you've set [CGI] dirlist=1, which enables this behaviour;
the default is 0 (ie, you cannot list the cgi-bin directory).

However, this bit is untrue; the process is terminated as soon as the

Congratulations, you have found a bug in Xitami :-)

What seems to be happening is that Xitami was lower casing the URL
somewhere along the way, but since this server is running on Linux, when
it does that with paths that are actually in upper case, it can no
longer access the directories: hence 404.

I've worked around this temporarily (symbolic links), which will last
until the end of the month (I hope), and obviously we'll put this bug
onto our bug list :-)

Thanks for chasing this up.

XiFusion v2.5 (a link to it is now available from the Xitami add-ons page)
will solve your problem.  It will handle both relative and absolute page
redirection (the latter is sent back to the browser for processing and
forwarding).  While XiFusion v2.5 is designed primarily for interfacing
ColdFusion with Xitami, it provides an excellent wrapper for PHP (v4.x) as
well.

Hope that helps!

I've put a copy at:

http://www.xitami.com./xifusion.zip

As best I can tell the crosswinds.net site doesn't like the referer:
header containing xitami.com in it; I'm not sure why.  If I download it
with the URL (without using a link) it works fine.  If I use the link on
the addons page, it fails; if I simulate using the link on the addons
page (in a telnet session) I get a redirect to a webpage.

I haven't changed the link on the xitami.com site yet.

I'll wait until I hear from Thomas before changing it; maybe there is
something else we can link to which will not cause the same problem, but
will still allow Thomas to easily update his program when he wants to.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

That assertion checks that when the internal routines are trying to
locate an internal method call, both the name of the "agent" (FTP, HTTP,
etc), and the name of the method are defined.  Since these should always
be defined, I'm puzzled as to why you are receiving the messages you
are.

Do they happen after anything in particular has occured?  Have you found
a way to repeat them?  Being able to reproduce a problem like this is
the biggest step to solving it.

END OF COMMANDS
**** Help for Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
:


This help message is being sent to you from the Majordomo mailing list
management system at Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
.

This is version 1.94.5 of Majordomo.

If you're familiar with mail servers, an advanced user's summary of
Majordomo's commands appears at the end of this message.

Majordomo is an automated system which allows users to subscribe
and unsubscribe to mailing lists, and to retrieve files from list
archives.

You can interact with the Majordomo software by sending it commands
in the body of mail messages addressed to "Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
".
Please do not put your commands on the subject line; Majordomo does
not process commands in the subject line.

You may put multiple Majordomo commands in the same mail message.
Put each command on a line by itself.

If you use a "signature block" at the end of your mail, Majordomo may
mistakenly believe each line of your message is a command; you will
then receive spurious error messages.  To keep this from happening,
either put a line starting with a hyphen ("-") before your signature,
or put a line with just the word

	end

on it in the same place.  This will stop the Majordomo software from
processing your signature as bad commands.

Here are some of the things you can do using Majordomo:

I.	FINDING OUT WHICH LISTS ARE ON THIS SYSTEM

To get a list of publicly-available mailing lists on this system, put the
following line in the body of your mail message to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
:

	lists

Each line will contain the name of a mailing list and a brief description
of the list.

To get more information about a particular list, use the "info" command,
supplying the name of the list.  For example, if the name of the list 
about which you wish information is "demo-list", you would put the line

	info demo-list

in the body of the mail message.

II.	SUBSCRIBING TO A LIST

Once you've determined that you wish to subscribe to one or more lists on
this system, you can send commands to Majordomo to have it add you to the
list, so you can begin receiving mailings.

To receive list mail at the address from which you're sending your mail,
simply say "subscribe" followed by the list's name:

	subscribe demo-list

If for some reason you wish to have the mailings go to a different address
(a friend's address, a specific other system on which you have an account,
or an address which is more correct than the one that automatically appears 
in the "From:" header on the mail you send), you would add that address to
the command.  For instance, if you're sending a request from your work
account, but wish to receive "demo-list" mail at your personal account
(for which we will use "jqpublic@my-isp.com" as an example), you'd put
the line

	subscribe demo-list jqpublic@my-isp.com

in the mail message body.

Based on configuration decisions made by the list owners, you may be added 
to the mailing list automatically.  You may also receive notification
that an authorization key is required for subscription.  Another message
will be sent to the address to be subscribed (which may or may not be the
same as yours) containing the key, and directing the user to send a
command found in that message back to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
.  (This can be
a bit of extra hassle, but it helps keep you from being swamped in extra
email by someone who forged requests from your address.)  You may also
get a message that your subscription is being forwarded to the list owner
for approval; some lists have waiting lists, or policies about who may
subscribe.  If your request is forwarded for approval, the list owner
should contact you soon after your request.

Upon subscribing, you should receive an introductory message, containing
list policies and features.  Save this message for future reference; it
will also contain exact directions for unsubscribing.  If you lose the
intro mail and would like another copy of the policies, send this message
to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
:

	intro demo-list

(substituting, of course, the real name of your list for "demo-list").

III.	UNSUBSCRIBING FROM MAILING LISTS

Your original intro message contains the exact command which should be
used to remove your address from the list.  However, in most cases, you
may simply send the command "unsubscribe" followed by the list name:

	unsubscribe demo-list

(This command may fail if your provider has changed the way your
address is shown in your mail.)

To remove an address other than the one from which you're sending
the request, give that address in the command:

	unsubscribe demo-list jqpublic@my-isp.com

In either of these cases, you can tell Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
 to remove
the address in question from all lists on this server by using "*"
in place of the list name:

	unsubscribe *
	unsubscribe * jqpublic@my-isp.com

IV.	FINDING THE LISTS TO WHICH AN ADDRESS IS SUBSCRIBED

To find the lists to which your address is subscribed, send this command
in the body of a mail message to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
:

	which

You can look for other addresses, or parts of an address, by specifying
the text for which Majordomo should search.  For instance, to find which
users at my-isp.com are subscribed to which lists, you might send the
command

	which my-isp.com

Note that many list owners completely or fully disable the "which"
command, considering it a privacy violation.

V.	FINDING OUT WHO'S SUBSCRIBED TO A LIST

To get a list of the addresses on a particular list, you may use the
"who" command, followed by the name of the list:

	who demo-list

Note that many list owners allow only a list's subscribers to use the
"who" command, or disable it completely, believing it to be a privacy
violation.

VI.	RETRIEVING FILES FROM A LIST'S ARCHIVES

Many list owners keep archives of files associated with a list.  These
may include:
- back issues of the list
- help files, user profiles, and other documents associated with the list
- daily, monthly, or yearly archives for the list

To find out if a list has any files associated with it, use the "index"
command:

	index demo-list

If you see files in which you're interested, you may retrieve them by
using the "get" command and specifying the list name and archive filename.
For instance, to retrieve the files called "profile.form" (presumably a
form to fill out with your profile) and "demo-list.9611" (presumably the
messages posted to the list in November 1996), you would put the lines

	get demo-list profile.form
	get demo-list demo-list.9611

in your mail to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
.

VII.	GETTING MORE HELP

To contact a human site manager, send mail to Majordomo-Owner@palawatr.co.th
.
To contact the owner of a specific list, send mail to that list's
approval address, which is formed by adding "-approval" to the user-name
portion of the list's address.  For instance, to contact the list owner
for demo-list@palawatr.co.th
, you would send mail to demo-list-approval@palawatr.co.th
.

To get another copy of this help message, send mail to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th

This help message is being sent to you from the Majordomo mailing list
management system at Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
.

This is version 1.94.5 of Majordomo.

If you're familiar with mail servers, an advanced user's summary of
Majordomo's commands appears at the end of this message.

Majordomo is an automated system which allows users to subscribe
and unsubscribe to mailing lists, and to retrieve files from list
archives.

You can interact with the Majordomo software by sending it commands
in the body of mail messages addressed to "Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
".
Please do not put your commands on the subject line; Majordomo does
not process commands in the subject line.

You may put multiple Majordomo commands in the same mail message.
Put each command on a line by itself.

If you use a "signature block" at the end of your mail, Majordomo may
mistakenly believe each line of your message is a command; you will
then receive spurious error messages.  To keep this from happening,
either put a line starting with a hyphen ("-") before your signature,
or put a line with just the word

	end

on it in the same place.  This will stop the Majordomo software from
processing your signature as bad commands.

Here are some of the things you can do using Majordomo:

I.	FINDING OUT WHICH LISTS ARE ON THIS SYSTEM

To get a list of publicly-available mailing lists on this system, put the
following line in the body of your mail message to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
:

	lists

Each line will contain the name of a mailing list and a brief description
of the list.

To get more information about a particular list, use the "info" command,
supplying the name of the list.  For example, if the name of the list 
about which you wish information is "demo-list", you would put the line

	info demo-list

in the body of the mail message.

II.	SUBSCRIBING TO A LIST

Once you've determined that you wish to subscribe to one or more lists on
this system, you can send commands to Majordomo to have it add you to the
list, so you can begin receiving mailings.

To receive list mail at the address from which you're sending your mail,
simply say "subscribe" followed by the list's name:

	subscribe demo-list

If for some reason you wish to have the mailings go to a different address
(a friend's address, a specific other system on which you have an account,
or an address which is more correct than the one that automatically appears 
in the "From:" header on the mail you send), you would add that address to
the command.  For instance, if you're sending a request from your work
account, but wish to receive "demo-list" mail at your personal account
(for which we will use "jqpublic@my-isp.com" as an example), you'd put
the line

	subscribe demo-list jqpublic@my-isp.com

in the mail message body.

Based on configuration decisions made by the list owners, you may be added 
to the mailing list automatically.  You may also receive notification
that an authorization key is required for subscription.  Another message
will be sent to the address to be subscribed (which may or may not be the
same as yours) containing the key, and directing the user to send a
command found in that message back to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
.  (This can be
a bit of extra hassle, but it helps keep you from being swamped in extra
email by someone who forged requests from your address.)  You may also
get a message that your subscription is being forwarded to the list owner
for approval; some lists have waiting lists, or policies about who may
subscribe.  If your request is forwarded for approval, the list owner
should contact you soon after your request.

Upon subscribing, you should receive an introductory message, containing
list policies and features.  Save this message for future reference; it
will also contain exact directions for unsubscribing.  If you lose the
intro mail and would like another copy of the policies, send this message
to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
:

	intro demo-list

(substituting, of course, the real name of your list for "demo-list").

III.	UNSUBSCRIBING FROM MAILING LISTS

Your original intro message contains the exact command which should be
used to remove your address from the list.  However, in most cases, you
may simply send the command "unsubscribe" followed by the list name:

	unsubscribe demo-list

(This command may fail if your provider has changed the way your
address is shown in your mail.)

To remove an address other than the one from which you're sending
the request, give that address in the command:

	unsubscribe demo-list jqpublic@my-isp.com

In either of these cases, you can tell Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
 to remove
the address in question from all lists on this server by using "*"
in place of the list name:

	unsubscribe *
	unsubscribe * jqpublic@my-isp.com

IV.	FINDING THE LISTS TO WHICH AN ADDRESS IS SUBSCRIBED

To find the lists to which your address is subscribed, send this command
in the body of a mail message to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
:

	which

You can look for other addresses, or parts of an address, by specifying
the text for which Majordomo should search.  For instance, to find which
users at my-isp.com are subscribed to which lists, you might send the
command

	which my-isp.com

Note that many list owners completely or fully disable the "which"
command, considering it a privacy violation.

V.	FINDING OUT WHO'S SUBSCRIBED TO A LIST

To get a list of the addresses on a particular list, you may use the
"who" command, followed by the name of the list:

	who demo-list

Note that many list owners allow only a list's subscribers to use the
"who" command, or disable it completely, believing it to be a privacy
violation.

VI.	RETRIEVING FILES FROM A LIST'S ARCHIVES

Many list owners keep archives of files associated with a list.  These
may include:
- back issues of the list
- help files, user profiles, and other documents associated with the list
- daily, monthly, or yearly archives for the list

To find out if a list has any files associated with it, use the "index"
command:

	index demo-list

If you see files in which you're interested, you may retrieve them by
using the "get" command and specifying the list name and archive filename.
For instance, to retrieve the files called "profile.form" (presumably a
form to fill out with your profile) and "demo-list.9611" (presumably the
messages posted to the list in November 1996), you would put the lines

	get demo-list profile.form
	get demo-list demo-list.9611

in your mail to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
.

in place of the list name:

	unsubscribe *
	unsubscribe * jqpublic@my-isp.com

IV.	FINDING THE LISTS TO WHICH AN ADDRESS IS SUBSCRIBED

To find the lists to which your address is subscribed, send this command
in the body of a mail message to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
:

	which

You can look for other addresses, or parts of an address, by specifying
the text for which Majordomo should search.  For instance, to find which
users at my-isp.com are subscribed to which lists, you might send the
command

	which my-isp.com

Note that many list owners completely or fully disable the "which"
command, considering it a privacy violation.

V.	FINDING OUT WHO'S SUBSCRIBED TO A LIST

To get a list of the addresses on a particular list, you may use the
"who" command, followed by the name of the list:

	who demo-list

Note that many list owners allow only a list's subscribers to use the
"who" command, or disable it completely, believing it to be a privacy
violation.

VI.	RETRIEVING FILES FROM A LIST'S ARCHIVES

Many list owners keep archives of files associated with a list.  These
may include:
- back issues of the list
- help files, user profiles, and other documents associated with the list
- daily, monthly, or yearly archives for the list

To find out if a list has any files associated with it, use the "index"
command:

	index demo-list

If you see files in which you're interested, you may retrieve them by
using the "get" command and specifying the list name and archive filename.
For instance, to retrieve the files called "profile.form" (presumably a
form to fill out with your profile) and "demo-list.9611" (presumably the
messages posted to the list in November 1996), you would put the lines

	get demo-list profile.form
	get demo-list demo-list.9611

in your mail to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
.

VII.	GETTING MORE HELP

To contact a human site manager, send mail to Majordomo-Owner@palawatr.co.th
.
To contact the owner of a specific list, send mail to that list's
approval address, which is formed by adding "-approval" to the user-name
portion of the list's address.  For instance, to contact the list owner
for demo-list@palawatr.co.th
, you would send mail to demo-list-approval@palawatr.co.th
.

To get another copy of this help message, send mail to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th

with a line saying

END OF COMMANDS
**** Help for Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
:


This help message is being sent to you from the Majordomo mailing list
management system at Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
.

This is version 1.94.5 of Majordomo.

If you're familiar with mail servers, an advanced user's summary of
Majordomo's commands appears at the end of this message.

Majordomo is an automated system which allows users to subscribe
and unsubscribe to mailing lists, and to retrieve files from list
archives.

You can interact with the Majordomo software by sending it commands
in the body of mail messages addressed to "Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
".
Please do not put your commands on the subject line; Majordomo does
not process commands in the subject line.

You may put multiple Majordomo commands in the same mail message.
Put each command on a line by itself.

If you use a "signature block" at the end of your mail, Majordomo may
mistakenly believe each line of your message is a command; you will
then receive spurious error messages.  To keep this from happening,
either put a line starting with a hyphen ("-") before your signature,
or put a line with just the word

	end

on it in the same place.  This will stop the Majordomo software from
processing your signature as bad commands.

Here are some of the things you can do using Majordomo:

I.	FINDING OUT WHICH LISTS ARE ON THIS SYSTEM

To get a list of publicly-available mailing lists on this system, put the
following line in the body of your mail message to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
:

	lists

Each line will contain the name of a mailing list and a brief description
of the list.

To get more information about a particular list, use the "info" command,
supplying the name of the list.  For example, if the name of the list 
about which you wish information is "demo-list", you would put the line

	info demo-list

in the body of the mail message.

II.	SUBSCRIBING TO A LIST

Once you've determined that you wish to subscribe to one or more lists on
this system, you can send commands to Majordomo to have it add you to the
list, so you can begin receiving mailings.

To receive list mail at the address from which you're sending your mail,
simply say "subscribe" followed by the list's name:

	subscribe demo-list

If for some reason you wish to have the mailings go to a different address
(a friend's address, a specific other system on which you have an account,
or an address which is more correct than the one that automatically appears 
in the "From:" header on the mail you send), you would add that address to
the command.  For instance, if you're sending a request from your work
account, but wish to receive "demo-list" mail at your personal account
(for which we will use "jqpublic@my-isp.com" as an example), you'd put
the line

	subscribe demo-list jqpublic@my-isp.com

in the mail message body.

Based on configuration decisions made by the list owners, you may be added 
to the mailing list automatically.  You may also receive notification
that an authorization key is required for subscription.  Another message
will be sent to the address to be subscribed (which may or may not be the
same as yours) containing the key, and directing the user to send a
command found in that message back to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
.  (This can be
a bit of extra hassle, but it helps keep you from being swamped in extra
email by someone who forged requests from your address.)  You may also
get a message that your subscription is being forwarded to the list owner
for approval; some lists have waiting lists, or policies about who may
subscribe.  If your request is forwarded for approval, the list owner
should contact you soon after your request.

Upon subscribing, you should receive an introductory message, containing
list policies and features.  Save this message for future reference; it
will also contain exact directions for unsubscribing.  If you lose the
intro mail and would like another copy of the policies, send this message
to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
:

	intro demo-list

(substituting, of course, the real name of your list for "demo-list").

III.	UNSUBSCRIBING FROM MAILING LISTS

Your original intro message contains the exact command which should be
used to remove your address from the list.  However, in most cases, you
may simply send the command "unsubscribe" followed by the list name:

	unsubscribe demo-list

(This command may fail if your provider has changed the way your
address is shown in your mail.)

To remove an address other than the one from which you're sending
the request, give that address in the command:

	unsubscribe demo-list jqpublic@my-isp.com

In either of these cases, you can tell Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
 to remove
the address in question from all lists on this server by using "*"
in place of the list name:

	unsubscribe *
	unsubscribe * jqpublic@my-isp.com

IV.	FINDING THE LISTS TO WHICH AN ADDRESS IS SUBSCRIBED

To find the lists to which your address is subscribed, send this command
in the body of a mail message to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th
:

	which

You can look for other addresses, or parts of an address, by specifying
the text for which Majordomo should search.  For instance, to find which
users at my-isp.com are subscribed to which lists, you might send the
command

	which my-isp.com

Note that many list owners completely or fully disable the "which"
command, considering it a privacy violation.

V.	FINDING OUT WHO'S SUBSCRIBED TO A LIST

To get a list of the addresses on a particular list, you may use the
"who" command, followed by the name of the list:

	who demo-list

Note that many list owners allow only a list's subscribers to use the
"who" command, or disable it completely, believing it to be a privacy
violation.

VI.	RETRIEVING FILES FROM A LIST'S ARCHIVES

Many list owners keep archives of files associated with a list.  These
may include:
- back issues of the list
- help files, user profiles, and other documents associated with the list
- daily, monthly, or yearly archives for the list

To find out if a list has any files associated with it, use the "index"
command:

	index demo-list

If you see files in which you're interested, you may retrieve them by
using the "get" command and specifying the list name and archive filename.
For instance, to retrieve the files called "profile.form" (presumably a
form to fill out with your profile) and "demo-list.9611" (presumably the
messages posted to the list in November 1996), you would put the lines

	get demo-list profile.form
	get demo-list demo-list.9611

in your mail to Majordomo@palawatr.co.th

I apologise for this noise on the mailing list.  Someone, presumably at
palawatr.co.th, appears to be feeding messages from the Xitami list to
majordomo's subscription address, which is then replying to the mailing
list, which then arrive at majordomo, which....

I have suspended mail for all users at palawatr.co.th, and hope that the
problem will settle down soon (now that, hopefully, the loop is broken).

If I doesn't I'll be removing all users from palawatr.co.th from the
mailing list, and possibly banning them from resubscribing until I've
had confirmation the problem has been resolved.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami on FreeBSD
Message-ID: <20010619005439.D832DB8103@christel.heitec.net>

Hi,

I'd like to introduce myself as the maintainer of the Xitami port on
FreeBSD.

Being the maintainer means, I'll have to see to it that Xitami compiles,
installs and runs well on the FreeBSD platform. Apart from patching some
sources and providing a proper makefile, this basically boils down to
watching the xitami web site for announcements, and the rest is waiting
for problem-mails from users.

Hence, if you have any problems with or questions concerning Xitami on
FreeBSD, I'd appreciate a mail about it.

I can state that for me, Xitami runs just fine, at least the HTTP and
CGI part of it (I don't use the FTP part because FreeBSD has a FTP
server of its own). I'd like the log to be written via the syslog daemon
though, rather than directly into files.

In case you wonder what FreeBSD is, it's an open-source Unix, closely
related to NetBSD and OpenBSD; please see http://www.freebsd.org/ for
details. You find the Xitami port listet on
http://www.freebsd.org/ports/www.html .

Thanks,
	Bernd

Using Xitami v2.4d9 on Windows 98. Have set up directory password list in
defaults.aut. This setup works fine except with IE when it encounters a web
page that contains 2 Real Audio files. The page loads ok but when you click
on the play button IE requests the Username & Password again before it will
play the file. The problem does not occur if password restrictions are
removed.

I have waisted many an hour trying various configurations and HTML code but
have had no success. Any help would be great before I try some alternative
password protection software.

Is it IE requesting the username/password again?  Or real player?

There's two things I can think of which might be going on here: 
(a) the files are in different directories, and you've got two sets of
    protections being applied, with different realms.  You can work 
    around this problem by setting the realm name in the .aut file
    for both protected directories to be the same (and making sure the
    same usernames/passwords apply to both).

(b) IE (which gets the authentication for the HTML page) and real player
    (which gets the authentication for the audio) do not talk to each
    other to exchange authentication information.  Which mean that both
    have to ask for that information.  This is certainly the case when
    real player is used externally, but I'm not sure if it is the case
    when it is embedded in a webpage.

Basically if you are going to password protect both HTML and audio, and
use two applications which don't talk to each other to exchange password
information, then both will have to ask the user for the password
information.

There are ways to design a system that protects the HTML and audio
without requiring the password to be entered twice, but it requires
server-side code (CGIs, LRWP, servlets, etc), and doing much of the
server-side authentication handling yourself, rather than relying on the
webservers build in basic authentication.

Hi.  I'd wondered who it was that was maintaining the FreeBSD port.

It's good to hear it works well.  FWIW, most webservers write their
own logfiles (eg, Apache does as well, as well as almost all the "tiny"
http servesr I've seen), because they have special requirements for log
files which syslog doesn't handle quite so well.

We're in the process of trying to revamp the build system for all our
open source software tools to make it a little more flexible, and
hopefully a little more unix friendly.  (I develop mainly under Debian
Linux, but a number of the other iMatix developers are more Windows
focused, and this shows in a few places in Xitami.)

If there are particular things that cause a problem with the FreeBSD
port which we could look at please let me know, either directly or
ideally on the Xitami-Dev mailing list (you can subscribe at:

http://lists.xitami.org./mailman/listinfo/xitami-dev

Thank you for the reply.

The HTML file is located in a password protected directory while the sound
file (109k) and movie file (188k) are in subdirectories of the above. The
problem does not occur in Netscape and is occasionally fixed if the page is
refreshed in IE, but not always. I have also experimented using .ra as well
as .rpm files, no difference. The problem does not occur if the web page has
only one RealAudio file or if tested on the same computer as the server. I
have also tried setting same usernames and passwords to the subdirectories
with no effect.

You can check the test site at http://130.95.10.131/test/lesson01-08.html.
The username and password are both "test". The site is normally set up for
an intranet so loading may be slow. If by some small chance the page plays
normally, clear IE's temporary files and reload.

Further assistance would be appreciated.

Changing file type probably won't help; and if you change to the real
"this is where to get the audio/video" index files (.rpu? I forget),
then the problem wil probably get worse.

>The problem does not occur if the web page has only one RealAudio file or

The default for subdirectories is to use the settings of the parent that
is protected, and this seems to be what is happening in your case.
However I'm puzzled by your statement that it doesn't happen if there is
only one RealAudio file on the page; the factors I gave before would
leave it either working or not working with 1 or more files on the page.

What you might want to try doing is turning on the Xitami server
debugging ([Server] debug=1), and then try loading the page.  Once
you've done that look at debug/debug.log to see what queries Xitami
received, and how it handled them.  My guess is that for some reason one
of the queries must be missing the username/password -- but I'm puzzled
why including two real files on the page causes that when including just
one doesn't.

Xitami 2.4d has SSI support through the PerlSSI filter.

Xitami 2.5b (the beta version) has "built in" SSI support.

Unfortunately it seems that the debug log doesn't show the detail I was
hoping.  We'll just have to make do with the access log: it should show
a "401" response (authentication required) for the ones that are going
to prompt for passwords, and a "200" response (found) when it sends the
file out.  Possibly the order in which the requests come in, and which
ones get a 401 response will give us some idea what is going on.

>From what you've said it appears for some reason that IE doesn't send
the authentication information with the second Real element on the page
(or Xitami doesn't accept it for some reason).

By default (and we recommend) .html files are not processed for ssi tags
(it is too much of an overhead).

There is some problem in calling perl.  Make sure you have Perl
installed in a directory like c:\perl (ie, preferably with no spaces in
its path name), and your PATH includes c:\perl\bin in it.  If that
doesn't help, you'll need to tell us more about the "500 internal server
error" that you get -- the message includes details about what went
wrong which can be helpful in figuring out the problem.   Until perl can
be started, you probably won't see anything in cgierr.log.

The progress indication can only be displayed if the total length to be
sent is known; for some reason it seems that this information is being
lost/omitted with the method you are using (or being ignored).  The
Content-Length: header usually contains this information, and Xitami
should preserve this where possible.

Random thought: does it make any difference if you use Content-Length:
for the header name, rather than Content-length:?  IIRC it's not
supposed to be case sensitive, but perhaps something is treating it as
case sensitive?

If you are able to do so, you might also want to capture the headers
sent back to the browser (eg, network traffic snooping) and see if the
Content-Length: header is still present, and has the right value in it.

Definitely doing something wrong, but then i'm an expert at that.
I have been told it's through the Perl install and someconfig

My pc is 98 and i have the latest Xitami version - i have been using Apache
on this machine
and i am only working on customer projects (design authoring) using this.
But i would like to reinstall Xitami and configure it again

This is cheeky - but would you mind possibly sending me your config file for
me to work through and see what and how i have gone wrong before. Obviously
i will need to assign my own paths etc, but it would really help as a
comparison to what i think were the settings i need

I will be installing Perl within the Xitami directory which will be on
C:/Xitami

This is how I got Perl running in Xitami
it allows me to use,

<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/test.pl" -->

This SSI command
which is a potential security risk for your system
is only accepted if the environment variable
SSI_INSECURE is set to 'yes'
Under Windows NT

Reboot?  (I don't know if this is required.)

under Windows 95/98 by adding
SET SSI_INSECURE=yes to the autoexec.bat.
to run SSI.
If Perl is installed correctly?
On a windows system,
You then should be able to call
Perl from anywhere in your system.
This allows the shebang to be #! perl -w

this also allows the use of
#! /usr/bin/perl
for the shebang. so as long
as we don't use win32 specific modules
or system calls we can keep our programs

Fantastic - it's amazing what can make me happy !
Thanks chaps - I realised what had happened before

I had installed the Beta some time ago and was sure (ish) that I had ssi
support
somehow - the recent install was the last full release with config required,
hence no ssi

with the info below, I have it working - Thanks all.

Last thing I promise - the server sometimes really slows and seems to freeze
when I view the pages from the same p.c. 127.0.0.1  I have turned off cache
pages and 'keep alive connections' but to no avail

I am also having problems setting the thing up to emulate an Host - to use
the expression from Apache - 'virtual' hosts - effectively client accounts
that will have the path like this: /usr/users1/erevna/public_html
and this is only to test locally not to serve - hence using computer name
and ip - http://Triggerhippie/ or http://127.0.0.1/

would like to access via http://www.erevna.co.uk/ from my machine locally to
test the cgi/perl scripts (/usr/bin/perl) and message board for this site -
(opened can of worms now I have given you chaps the URL lol - mark 2 coming
soon)

I do apologise for all these questions but this is the best support I have
so far. (should have joined the list ages ago - and yes I did read the
documentation believe it or not - all Greek to me !)

This is how I got Perl running in Xitami
it allows me to use,

<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/test.pl" -->

Running Windows98
Xitami v2.4d6

in your
autoexec.bat

SET PATH=C:\PERL\BIN;%PATH%
SET SSI_INSECURE=YES

defaults.cfg
[Filter]
    .shtm=perlssi
    .shtml=perlssi
    .ssi=perlssi
[Ssi]
    Enabled=1
    Exec=1

hope this helps

Folks,

There is another way, I think better. I have a site
http://www.altair7.com/index.html that uses a perl script for opening page,
see for your self.

I do not have the SSI_INSECURE set.  I do have MIME types defined as following
for the master config:

	 .pl = c:\perl\bin\perlis.dll
	.cgi = c:\perl\bin\perlis.dll

This solved all my problems.

Steps:

1. http://127.0.0.1/admin
2. configuration -> mime
3. enter the above values
4. save
5. click on restart from the main page

Done.

With that done, then this works:

	http://www.altair7.com/cgi-bin/od.pl

This works with xitami 2.4d1 through 7 and xitami pro versions.

Hope that helps, always make sure that you protect your perl scripts.

Cheers,
-Roberto

I have had a look at Paul Reid's site which works fine with multiple RA =

Cool Roberto I will add this as a option to this help text that I send

This is not true for me on W2Ksp2 Xitami2.5b5.  <!--#exec

The latter only needed to run   #exec cmd   constructs, which certainly can
expose you to risk much more than your own scripts. Therefore, I would NOT
recommend to set SSI_INSECURE=YES

This is just strange.  304 is "not modified" which means "the copy
you've already got is up to date, you can use that"; 200 is "found" and
means "here you go, here's a copy of the thing you requested".

In _both_ cases it should play just fine, as both bits of audio are
available without apparent problems.

What I'm really puzzled about is IE getting a 304 return on both files
(ie, being told the local copies are fine), and then deciding it needs
to get a copy of them _anyway_.  It almost looks like IE doesn't believe
the webserver when it says the existing files are okay!

I see you're using IE 5.0: is this the 5.0 with the security problems,
or the 5.01 fixed version (I don't know if they report different
User-Agent headings).  In either case I would expect it to work, but
apparently it isn't working "as expected".

One thing you might want to consider if it's causing you a lot of pain
is "security through obscurity" -- put the RA files in a non-password
protected directory, and just only link to them from your hidden page.
Obviously anyone who knew the URL would then be able to get the RA
files, but hopefully IE will then manage to cope.

I posted to Don off-list; I didn't want to tell everybody the details of my
"security through obscurity" trick.

But just as you say: the HTML file and a RAM file containing the URL(s) of the
media file(s) are in an Xitami-password directory; the actual media files are
in a "public" but not browsable folder (and a different machine and server,
but that should not matter). 

The security risk is that someone might capture the RAM file; or the URL in
standalone RealPlayer, and give it to unauthorized persons. 

> The difference is that my RA files are embedded which seems to cause the problem in IE. 

Don's page with embedded player is slick, I like it; but I had little luck
with embedding more than one player per page. It is supposed to work, I've
seen it work (without passwording), but it all seems very flaky to me. I think
it is a low priority at Real.Inc.

     Paul thank you!  My network cards are 10/100 cards and I set them to
auto-negotiation and file transfers on my LAN are where they should be now.
I can transfer 340 Megabytes in 6 minutes on my 10 MegaBit router.  My FTP
transfers are still slow.  About 340 MegaBytes in 30 minutes from inside my
LAN
and 5 hours from outside the LAN both from within Adelphia.Net and outside
on another cable service but I suspect my ISP Adelphia.Net has a throttle on
this.  They don't want people running any sort of servers and all technical
information about their network is treated as a big secret.  I suppose I'll
just have to bide my time until we get a real ISP in the area.  I had the
network cards set to 10 MegaBits.  I thought it made sense since I had a 10
MegaBit router and I thought it would speed things up.

I have never really played with the passwords in xitami but i did write a
perl script that checks login and password and once it confirms these it
loads up a picture and delivers it to the user ....only the script knows
where the picture is and it is therefore impossible to link to the picture
directly.

im sure that the same thing could be applied to your real audio files to
hide them.
my script allows for the originating directory to be anywhere on the drive
and it can therefore be outside the web folders.

another possibility is that you use perl to rename  the file or dir each
time it is accessed again making any links to it useless.

Thanks to Ewen & Paul.

The problem still has not been resolved but seems to be likely caused by
IE5, ActiveX or RealPlayer. I have written away to RealPlayer describing the
fault to see if any further information can be obtained.

In the meantime I will try security through obscurity of rewite these pages
so that only one RA file exists per page. Netscape still has some
advantages.

I will let you know of any developments. Thanks

Did not set it and can still do SSI? I would think that the version your

I have to frequently change from a max of 3 users to 20 users (under W98SE
xitami ver 2.5b.)  I limit to 3 when I am home as to not slow up my
connection, then the maximum users when I'm not around.  I find that even
after save, halt, and then start (or restart) of the server, the previous
max connections, either 3 or blank, is still there.  If I reboot, then the
new settings are used.  I have to Xitami servers going, on the normal port
80, the other on port 2080.  I rarely have to do anything with the 2080
server, but I have to change the other about every 12 hours.
Am I missing something?  I thought that after saving, halt/start, or
restart, it should use the new settings.  The servers are in two different
directories, with the ftp server active only on it's normal port 21, the one
for 2021 is disabled.  I know for the max connections on the FTP server you
have to restart the computer, but not for the http server.
This is a simple server, no cgi, no bells and whistles, just a LOT of MPEGs.

All help is GREATLY appreciated.

I have NOT had my morning coffee yet, so don't trust these numbers until you
run them through your abacus. I've probably dropped decimal points all over
the floor. So all this may be wrong. 

> 340 Megabytes in 6 minutes on my 10 MegaBit router.  

0.94 MegaBytes/Second, 7.5 Megabits/Second is excellent for a 10-speed
connection. That shows that the LAN hardware is running a full 10-speed. I
have seen a shade higher (1.1 MegaBytes/Sec) on a new 10MBPS switch-- have not
seen that since everybody else on the floor got hooked up. 

> FTP from inside my LAN  About 340 MegaBytes in 30 minutes 

Even allowing for FTP overhead, 0.189 MegaBytes/Sec (1.5 Megabits/Sec) inside
a LAN is not great, but not shocking if the line is 10 MBPS. If both computers
and the hub are supposedly working at 100 MBPS, it sucks. 

I just FTP-ed 8.3 MegaBytes from the (Xitami, P-133, 10MBPS) server down the
hall in 11 sec. 0.75 MegaBytes/Sec, 6 Megabits/Sec. 

Are the PCs old and slow? Have you burdened the FTP server with aliases or
many-many Vhosts it must figure out? (You don't have Napster running I hope.)

Note that your cable-router does NOT have to be your internal LAN hub. I have
100 MBPS around the office on this floor, but a 10 MBPS link to a router in
the basement. When I find two 100 MBPS PCs to talk to each other locally, I
get over 3 MegaBytes/Sec. (I keep a 10 MBPS card in the web server partly so
it can't clog the LAN.)

> 340 MB in 5 hours through ISP

0.019 MegaBytes per second, 150 Kilobits/Sec, sounds like a throttled
connection to me. That's 3 or 4 times better than 56K modem. That's probably
what home cable providers aim for: as you say they don't want you running a
high-traffic site on a home-price account, but I guess they don't want it to
be "worse" than a 56K phone modem.

Subject: [Xitami] FTP upload problems from webcam software
Message-ID: <3.0.6.32.20010622181057.014eaa80@pop.surrey.ac.uk>

Hi,

I have had troubles with Xitami 2.4d9 on Win98se and uploading via ftp from some webcam software called Video Capturix 2001 (www.capturix.com).  After successfully making a local disk copy of the image (jpg or bmp) it then proceeds to upload to the specified server but in this case only about 50% of the file is ever saved on the Xitami server.  No error messages appear in the Xitami ftp.log files.  They just note an upload.  This is very repeatable and I even upgraded the Xitami from 2.4d7 to 2.4d9 to see if it still happened.

If I run Win9x FTP command then it easily uploads the same images okay.  If I run other webcam software it uploads okay.  If I run other ftp server on the machine (and disable Xitami) it works okay from Video Capturix 2001.  So where is the problem and where do I go from here ?  Is it maybe the default transfer mode bin or ascii maybe ?

I am going to install WFTPD to get around the problem (which I licenced for our old web server before moving over to Xitami about 12mths ago) but I would like to have it all working.

Are there any detailed debug options for the FTP upload ?

Yours,

Andy..

I run a Xitami-based LRWP app on the web that generates star-charts interactively.

It has been running for about 2 years now, and I guess it has probably generated about 2 million unique
star-charts, but I have never counted them.

Does anyone know of a stable counter I can run on my server - that I can trigger from Javascript?
I would like the javascript to cause the counter to increment, and a small graphic showing the current
count to be returned so I can show the current count on my pages.

A LRWP based counter would be best as my servers are already set up to handle LRWP and LRWP seems to work
so fast.

Thanks.

Ah ha. 

I was going to say that Xitami didn't use threads, so I didn't see what
the problem could be, but IIRC there are a few minor uses of threads for
various auxillary things (and EMX uses threads for a few things).
(Xitami mostly works as a single process, single thread, and uses
select() and SMT to figure out what to do next.)

Our development version makes even less use of thread-related things, so
it's possible the problem might go away with that.  Unfortunately we
don't curerntly have an OS/2 development system, let alone a SMP-capable
OS/2 development system available.  However I do have a SMP Linux
development system, and I might try playing there and see if anything
breaks.

And it's useful to know that single-threaded Xitami is very stable. 

Thanks for following this up.

 Well, it's listed as running on two threads here. I'm quite familiar
with the situation that I'm seeing problems that no-one else is
encountering... <g> Please note that it must have been something that
changed after v2.4d6.

 whenever you have something to test (assuming that Bernd Hohman had
volunteered to do the compilation for an OS/2 version) I'll be happy to
run it here.

>And it's useful to know that single-threaded Xitami is very stable.

 It's not making it single-threaded. Execmode only restricts the
software from accessing both processors and puts all the workload for
that package on processor #1; effectively making a given software as if
running on a uniprocessor system. From what I learned by following
other SMP-related bugs I came across it could be more of a timing
problem (or the like).

There are a gazillion counters that return a graphic of a number.
I'm not sure what you mean "trigger from Javascript" -- you can 
document.write almost anything. 

I have one counter, a Windows NT EXE, that I trigger from static
HTML. It returns a graphic of a number. 

I have another counter that I call from Javascript (with a
NOSCRIPT option to catch lame or hobbled browsers). It is written
in Perl and returns a static image (generally a 1x1 transparent
GIF to satisfy the browser without showing on the page) but keeps
detailed logs of hits. Another Perl script summarizes the hits,
but that isn't made public. That's for pages where I want to know
what kind of surfers are hitting, but don't want them to see how
(un)popular the site is. 

Look on the top page of Music.rutgers.edu , low on the left is
the static-call public graphic counter. I'm looking for where I
got it from... the name in it is Henn Saar, 1995.

I've not done any multi-threaded development myself either, but AIUI, the
support for multi-threading in OS/2 is an order of magnitude more
efficient than that in ANY dialect of Unix.  If you cannot properly
"corral" multiple execution threads, perhaps Xitami needs to make a
conscious effort to disable threading.  (Given that OS/2's multi-
threading support runs to 64 processors; also given that eComStation is
going to make a cheap SMP O/S available to all those with dual Pentium
motherboards.)

Indeed.

I failed to make it clear that multi-threading in no way requires
multiple processors (as has already been mentioned elsewhere in this
thread:-)

AIUI, under Linux, creating a separate execution thread is almost as
costly as forking another process, so programs tend to do the latter
rather than the former.  In contrast under OS/2, spawning a thread is a
very cheap operation, so multi-threaded programs are more common.

Subject: [Xitami] Newbie can't setup virtual hosts
Message-ID: <20010624175998.SM00258@default>

Hi:

Although I have been coding HTML for about 4 yrs now, I have yet to 
setup a server and am having a bit of trouble.  I am running 
Win98SE.  I downloaded 2.5b4 and installed it and ping 127.0.0.1 
without any hitches: setting up virtual hosting has eluded me so far.

I have several website projects underway right now and on some of 
their servers, I can use SSI and Perl and would like to code and test 
as if I were using their servers.  My hard drives have many partitions 
and as a result, Xitami is installed on H:\Xitami and my websites are 
located at O:\WebSites\... for example, O:\WebSites\stc, 
O:\WebSites\mndm, O:\WebSites\cuac, and so on.  I would like to 
setup Xitami so that when I use SSI on the stc site, the server will 
run it properly.

I tried setting up virtual hosts so that one IP address may be used 
for multiple sites such as 127.0.0.1=stc.cfg, 127.0.0.1=mndm.cfg 
but I didn't know how to call up the sites using my browser.  I then 
tried the DNS approach and set virtual hosting to 
www2.stc.com=stc.cfg but when I typed www2.stc.com in my 
browser's location bar, it dialed in and tried to find it on the 
Internet.  The help notes mention something about setting up a DNS 
server but I don't know how to do that.

For my purposes, which method is better and how do I set it up and 
how do I call up the "local" site?  I read the FAQ and the help notes 
but I either didn't understand or I didn't see what I was looking for.

Hi,

This was talked about by Andrew Tate a while back, but I didn't quite follow 
his directions.  I have a single web site running fine, but I have purchased 
a second (similar name) so that I could do testing.  I had it directed to my 
DSL provider, who just pointed it to my same IP address, so now I get my same 
web site when I type in website-name1 or website-name2.  

I would like to be able to have it go to the correct website when I type in 
the name, and I am pretty sure that I am supposed to use the VHOST stuff, but 
the documentation is fairly thin on how to actually set this up.  I think 
that Andrew Tate is running it that way now, so I gues what I would like to 
have is him, or someone else who is already doing this to point out what they 
did VHOST-wise to get it to work.  Currently xitami is only aware of the one 
website, although I have the directory structure already set u for the second 
site.  

I am assuming that there will be a second set of *.CFG files for the second 
site, but I'm stuck at how I get XITAMI to point to the correct site when I 
enter the website name for the second (or first) website name.

Hopefully I have stated the question clearly, but if I have not, please let 
me know and I will try to clairify the question a little better.

You probably have a text file called "hosts". On Windows NT it
may be at C:\WINNT\system32\hosts, though it has been seen under
many names. Even Lmhosts.sam (which is really for something else,
but has been known to influence IP lookup).

It looks something like this: 

# This is a sample HOSTS file ...

#  102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com      # source server

127.0.0.1       localhost

If typing "localhost" at your browser opens your page at
127.0.0.1, you have a hosts file somewhere (and that's why it
works). Anything on a line after "#" is ignored. 

Add some lines like 

127.0.0.1 manny

127.0.0.1 moe

127.0.0.1 jack

Save the file. 

Now, typing "manny" at your browser should open your default
127.0.0.1 page.

Now go into Xitami's Vhost settings and tell it that "manny"
points to a CFG file called "manny.cfg". In manny.cfg, point to
"O:/WebSites/mndm" as the root of the web pages for that host. Do
the same for moe and jack, except point to your other web-root
folders. 

Now typing manny, moe, or jack at your browser should open three
different web sites. 

You -may- still have trouble with your TCP stack not believing
the hosts file and going to the modem to ask a "real DNS". MS TCP
stacks can be quite dumb. 

When you get past that: I've had some trouble when web folders
are not on the same drive as Xitami. It "should" work, and often
it does, but sometimes it does not. 

Also: after setting or changing a Vhost, stop and restart Xitami.
I'm not sure if it "should" pick up the change on the fly, but my
habit is to force it to start anew.

Open http://www.yourhost.com/admin

It wants the name and password you picked when you installed
Xitami (the name is probably "admin"). Proceed to the Admin
screen. 

Fourth button down is "VHost Wizard". Click. 

 "Virtual Host Wizard

 Create virtual host profile:  ### make up a name like "test"

 Select IP address:  ### leave blank in this case
                                                      
 Or, enter DNS host name:  ### your second domain name
                                                                                
 Web page root directory:  ### where the second set of files are
                                                                                
You can leave the rest blank. 

This Wizard really does set it all up for you: making CFG files
that point to the right place. 

Stop and re-start Xitami after the change: it is sometimes loathe
to take on a new VHost until you whack it.

Under Linux creating a new process (with fork()) is almost as cheap as
creating a new thread -- which is what you said, but the emphasis is
that creating a new process is cheap.  (Starting a new program in that
process costs more; more like starting a new process in OS/2.)

Traditionally unix does not have threads, and even those unixes that do,
do not have them in a widely portable fashion.  So processes tend to get
used instead.

However as I said, Xitami tries to buck this trend and be single
threaded, single process -- which has its advantages and disadvantages.

All that said, I'm puzzled what could be causing your problem on a SMP
machine, which is fixed by running it on a single processor, if it isn't
a threading issue.  

Can you tell me what build flags you used to build Xitami?  And which
version of the compiler and build environment?

Many thanks Paul for your help.  I will try your suggestions this 
evening (I live north of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, same time zone 
as New York city).  I remember seeing reference to this hosts file in 
the documentation but did not know how to use it.

 since I'm running cgi programs written in rexx, smp is nice as all
spawned processes are distributed evenly on both processors.

 not being a programmer (other than rexx <g>) I can't help you much.
But what transpires to me as feedback on my (other) bug reports is that
thread timing seems critical on smp. My last bug report just the other
week was fixed within 24 hours - the programmers's immediate response
was "my gut feeling is it's this one..."

>Can you tell me what build flags you used to build Xitami?  And which

 I think there is misunderstanding: I did not build Xitami myself, I
only used the patched version that was made by Bernd Hohmann. HOWEVER,
the same applies also EACH version after v2.4d6 that was available on
the Xitami website. So it's probably independent on the tools used to
build the binary.

 When I first noticed (without doing the execmode test), I though that
it might relate to my EMX version used, which is the newer than the one
recommended. My current version is:
EMX : revision = 61
EMXIO : revision = 60
EMXLIBC : revision = 63
EMXLIBCM : revision = 64
EMXLIBCS : revision = 64
EMXWRAP : revision = 60
 I should add, however, that this does seem unlikely in view of my
later observations using execmode. Also, prior revisions (still above
the recommended level) showed the same problem.

 Hope this will get you any further.

BTW since TCP/IP stacks are supposed to check the hosts file before DNS 
(and in the MS 95 and 08 stacks do) then you can do some sneaky things 
by (for example) mapping ad.doubleclick.net to 127.0.0.1 and thus 
avoiding tiresome adverts

I have found however that occasionally this causes problems and run very 
very slowly. I am not sure that this is a Xitami problem but soemthing 
in the path of Netscape/Win95 IP stack/Xitami means that the time taken 
to resolve such addresses is very long.

Subject: [Xitami] Shebang #! question on win98
Message-ID: <001801c0fe25$c28f7340$01000084@triggerhippie>

Hi all,

I have reinstalled xitami beta for win98, and got vhosts running (and ssi -
thanks all for your patience with that stupid problem I thought I had).
I am testing and compiling sites using these addresses - http://anyname/

all ok so far, but - the cgi and perl scripts in my cgi-bin all have the #!
usr/bin/perl
path, which I wish to keep as the original host's environment, and this will
not work on Xitami. I have found the following information below under the
help/configuration documents, and wondered how I could allow these scripts
to work if at all - would I have to use aliases or something similar?

can I ultimately configure different sites to use their respective
'Shebang's' despite running on win98 se?

Please help, otherwise I may have to go back to trying to use lumbering
Apache again for the 4th time :o(

---------------------

What's the equivalent of the shebang ("#!") syntax for Win32?
Unfortunately, Win32 platforms don't provide the shebang syntax, or anything
like it.

Although Win32 systems themselves don't use the shebang, the Apache
webserver does. If you are using the Apache webserver on your Win32 system
you should put the shebang line at the top of your CGI scripts.

Your shebang line should look something like:

 #!perl

Xitami is even more generous than Apache: providing the #! line _ends_
with "perl", _and_ the perl binary is on the Path, Xitami will run it.
(It tries the exact path first, and if that is not found, it strips off
the path name, and tries that instead.)

So put perl in c:\perl, and add c:\perl\bin to your path, then start
Xitami.  And your #!/usr/bin/perl lines should work just fine.

On Xitami in DOS/Windows? Sure it does. 

The average unix interpreter and webserver wants the she-bang line to be
exact; they won't go searching for Perl.

As Ewen says, Xitami (at least when compiled for DOS/Win) is "Generous".
It knows that DOS is different, and it would be awkward to re-edit
scripts every time you move from unix to DOS. 

If the folder that the she-bang line points to doesn't exist, it pulls a
copy of PATH and starts hunting for Perl or Perl.exe. 

To prove that Xitami is pretty smart, I have some scripts with #!
/bing/bang/boom/perl , and it works. That fails, but PATH contains
d:\perl , and Xitami quickly finds it there. 

Probable problems: 

Perl Install asks if you want Perl on PATH. I hope you said Yes. Also,
you often have to shut-down and re-start Windows to get the changed
PATH. (You can force it manually, but Win98 needs a break anyway.)

Open a Command window and type PATH. If Perl's folder is on there,
re-start Xitami and it should work. If it isn't there, re-start Windows.
If you didn't let Perl Install modify PATH, open AUTOEXEC.BAT in notepad
and add it, restart.

Putting Perl in a path with a space in it (typically under "Program
Files" can give trouble. Very long (over 62 characters) paths can also
be iffy. I'm not sure if this is Xitami or Perl, but IAC nobody can
exactly duplicate MS's wacky handling of long spacy filenames. K.I.S.S.:
Keep It Short and Sweet. 

There is a limit in DOS/Win9x on the size of PATH (actually the
envoronment). If you've installed many programs that all think they
deserve to be on PATH (most don't), you may have to trim. 

In the unlikely event that you have a DOS/Win system that really does
have a /usr/bin directory, I thought that Xitami would fail if the
folder was valid and the program name wasn't right there. Mayeb I'm
wrong. If I'm right, the logical thing to do is put Perl in /usr/bin.

Message-ID: <3.0.6.32.20010626175104.00ad0c80@pop.surrey.ac.uk>

Hi,

Others have already replied and given some information.  The way the server decides on which site to serve up is the name given in the http request.  So for instance one of my servers is on ip 131.227.111.3 - you can try it and you get served up the  so called 'basehost.cfg' pages.  If you use www.cpe.surrey.ac.uk then it finds the string in the request and severs up the pages defined in www.cfg. 

However, this only works in recent browsers and may not be supported with light wap phones etc - I don't know.  I have just tested this and Netscape 1.0 and 1.2 give the basehost pages for www.cpe.surrey.ac.uk but version 2.0 and onwards behave properly.  I guess newer browsers pass on the request string.  Not that it matters much these days but I have no access to lightwieght browsers in personal phones and organisers. 

The suggestion to use the web admin page is good - once you have set one up then you can tweak and copy the actual file.  The main file to look at is:- 

defaults.cfg

and the lines that matter are like

[Virtual-hosts]
    Www.cpe.surrey.ac.uk=www.cfg
    Www.tates.co.uk=tates.cfg


as you see if you hit my server at 131.227.111.3 with the request string of www.cpe.surrey.ac.uk then it uses the www.cfg file for details of the web pages to serve up.  If however you use www.tates.co.uk then it looks in tates.cfg.  You can use any file name but these seemed sensible to me to keep it logical.  You can even have multiple domain names going to the same pages so you can have your own custom pages - " web site under construction "


Now file tates.cfg has 


[Accesslog]
    Cycle=5
    Cycle-arg=tates-acc%yy%mm%dd.log
    Filename=tates-access.log
    Format=CLF
    Cycle-how=0

[Alias]
    Xitami=c:/xitami/webpages/xitami

[Errorlog]
    Cycle=5
    Cycle-arg=tates-er%yy%mm%dd.log
    Filename=tates-error.log
    Format=CLFX
    Translate=1

[Rdns]
    Recurse-lookups=0

[Security]
    Filename=tates.aut
    Safepaths=0

[Server]
    Webpages=/xitami/websites/tates

[Serverlog]
    Enabled=0


so you see I mirror the normal file but put tates in place of the standard server to create log files, access files etc etc.  You also need to create tates.aut to set the authorisations.  I also use \websites as the directory under which all my virtual websites live but leave the default \webpages that Xitami sets up for basehost and other bits.

basehost.cfg is automatically picked up by xitami if there is no match hence it gets any other unknown dns name that points to the ip address or a pure ip address as in my example above. On my server I serve up a page all about the wonders of Xitami !!  The sample web pages that come with the distribution.

I have typed this quickly and hope it helps - they may be a few mistakes I am no expert.  I believe there is another way of multiple hosting where you assign multiple ip addresses to the same machine and xitami serves up the pages dependant on this but I have never done this and it does not seem to fit so well with the sort of re-direction available from isp services who will set up a redirection page for you.  It also needs an operating system able to assign multiple ips to one ethernet card or you need multiple ethernet cards...  not so easy.


Yours,

Andy Tate.

NetScape 2+ and IE 3+ send the URL of the page they expect to get. NS1
and IE2 don't. 

Basically, any browser made in the last 6 or 7 years will handle
name-based VHosting. 

I'm tracking browser versions on a general-interest page. I don't track
the oldest versions, but in the last 4,580 hits only 5 came from IE3, 0
from NS2, 100 from NS3. I suspect that NS1 and IE1-2 are less than NS2
and IE3, or well under 0.1%. 

Since few Win31 machines are alive, and Win95 came with IE3, the only
large clump of IE2 users will be Win NT4 machines that have avoided any
update of IE. (NT4 shipped with IE2, though many OEM installations and
all MS Office installations put something newer on.) Upgrades of NS and
IE are free. 

Those few people still using NS1 and IE2 are doing it because they want
to. They must know that the Web expects something more today; many sites
fall apart in NS1/IE2 (and yet some quite fancy sites stand up). If they
don't get the site they expect, that's really their choice.

As for palm wappers- I never saw one, in person or as a strange hit on
my site. And I know they are minimal machines. But named VHost just
means that they put the URL in the HTTP request header. They already
have the URL in their tiny mind, so it seems trivial to add it to the
request. And so many sites are really VHosted that I'd think they'd be
useless for general surfing unless they supported it.

Hello!

I'm not really a windows user, so please bear with me....

I would like to know if it is possible to run Xitami for windows outside of
the Systray.  The reason being that I am writing a Java that "controls" all
the processes in a product of ours (xitami being one of them), and for
whatever reason my Java code can't kill processes that are running in the
Systray  (It can start them though).

I could use the console version of xitami I know, that is what I am going to
work on right now,  I was just wondering if there is a quick and easy way to
force xitami outside of the systray.

I assume you are using the NT Service version.

The Service version is appropriate if you want Windows to auto-start the
service even before any user logs-on. My web server sits at the log-in
prompt for months on end, because there isn't any reason to log-on at
the terminal since Xitami starts before that as a Service.

If you or some process you wrote wants to be able to start and stop
Xitami at will, I'd think the Console version is more appropriate.

If Java can call an arbitrary DOS command, I think there is a
command-line option to kill the Service. But a stop-start mode is more
what the Console version is made for.

     I have two friends who run FTP sites but they don't use XITAMI.  When I
use the Windows 98 based FTP client to look at their sites I can't see other
disk drives.  These people have several hard drives full of information but
I can only see whichever drive I end up on when I log in.  In order to see
the other hard drives on their sites I have to use one of the other popular
FTP clients such as Cute or WSFTP.  I'm running XITAMI and I can see my one
other hard drive fine with the Windows 98 based FTP client.  Is there
something different about XITAMI or is it the way they have their sites set
up?  I much prefer the Windows 98 FTP client when it works.  If I get my
homework done maybe I can convince them as to why they should switch to
XITAMI.

Take a look at access.log, in the logs subdirectory of wherever you installed Xitami.  You might not be able to open it while Xitami is running, since it opens and locks that file when it starts up (at least for me; WinME, Xitami 2.4d9, YMMV).
If you (or anyone else) is interested, I've written a short perl script that goes through and analyzes this file.  http://xbones.resnet.gatech.edu/cgi-bin/logview.pl if you want to try it; email me if you want the source.

As far as I know flock() doesn't work on the Windows platform. That is
the
case with atleast the ActiveState distribution of Perl. You might want
to
try installing the LockFile::Simple package from CPAN, it may work.

Hi Espen !

I downloaded xitami2.5b4 for beos from bebits and installed it.
The result - generally I can say that it works. I can suppose what confused
you.
This is not a gui app, it's a console version. If you accepted default
location for installation then you have to:
start the Terminal
cd /boot/apps/Xitami    (mind case sensitivity)
xitami -s (to run Xitami in background or)
xitami -S (to run in foreground, default)
Use xitami -h for options.

Anyway I encountered some problems. I belive all files included in the
package are the same as for windows distributions which I use except the
binary itself. Thus I guess it wasn't properly compiled, something wrong
with paths. For example the images located in ./webpages/images do not load
if I type http://localhost/images/image_1.gif, but they do if I type
http://localhost//images/image_1.gif. On the other hand
./webpages/xitami/images works fine and
http://localhost/xitami/images/image_1.gif displays as desired. Probably for
the same reason an image map on the front page doesn't work. When I click
for testcgi.exe url on the map, it resolves as http:/cgi-bin/testcgi.exe
CGI themselves work fine, as well as SSI.
Perhaps, some tweaking can be done with configs. Didn't have time to try it
yesterday. All I wanna say that it didn't install well from scratch as my
windows version did.

Another serious issue for me is that when Xitami is started, cpu load for my
amd duron 750 goes up to 100% and stays there until I stop the server. I
have no idea what's going wrong. Never experienced that with any other BeOS
app.

I hope this info will be of value to you and I would like to hear your
comments on whether you'll be able to get it going.

Mike.

Subject: [Xitami] What's different about the XITAMI FTP server that makes it work with

There does appear to be differences - my email of 22 June mentions problems I have had with the Xitami FTP server and webcam uploads from Capturix software that works with other ftp servers but not with Xitami.

No one has replied to that message but I am interested in knowing of other ftp inconsistancies.  

Re browsing other disks I have noticed a couple of things.

Sometimes ftp servers can 'restrict to home directory' and stop browsing outside of the home directory tree defined for the user.  Other times you may not see the other disks (as ftp has roots in unix) so is not used to the disk drive letter idea but if you put 'cd d:/' it may take it and act correctly.

> [in BeOS] cpu load ... goes up to 100% and stays there

Does it yield? That is, when you do other work on the machine, does it
feel slow? 

I don't know BeOS, but in Windows many DOS apps will send the CPU Use
meter to the max yet the machine feels only 5%-10% slow in other
applications. 

In Windows, a proper app is supposed to give up its time slice if it has
nothing to do. DOS apps assume they own the whole machine. Many of them,
when "doing nothing" sit in a tight loop asking "Did user press a key
yet?", asking that question 750,000,000 times a second on modern CPUs.
Windows can't be sure if the DOS app's frenzy is doing something useful
or not. So if no other app is demanding cycles, the DOS app gets most of
the CPU's time. If another app does have something to do, it gets the
time it needs, and the DOS app gets just a few cycles on every loop of
the Windows task-switcher. 

Sometimes the DOS app appears to Windows to be greedy; I have a DOS
modem program that -will- slow the rest of Windows if it has trouble
opening the modem (because Windows has grabbed the modem for DUN). 

BTW, there are some tricks for time-sharing background programs in
Windows (NT). A main one is to "Stall" a DOS app when it is in the
background, so it gets no time when you are not using it. Good for a
text editor, bad for a web server. There are other priority options,
though I must note that some cause more trouble than they are worth.
(Don't put a DOS app in RealTime priority or you'll never get control
back!)

Clearly the BeOS compile of Xitami is not supporting whatever
load-sharing that BeOS has. Of course it is interesting that Xitami
works at all on a platform that isn't really a classic unix and isn't
DOS/Win or OS/2, the platforms that got specific support. 

There is of course a native web server in BeOS. And I'd guess that the
total BeOS webserver market is too small for anybody to spend a lot of
programming time on. But since Xitami itself runs on one big loop,
anybody who really knows BeOS's load-share technique (or who can find
similar code in some other BeOS application) could add a "Nothing to do
right now" flag to release the current time-slice back to BeOS.

I've posted this problem twice in the past and never got anywhere with it, and now I've reached the point where I really, REALLY need to get SSI working.

I'm running Xitami 2.5b4 on Win95 on a Dell Latitude. The SSI demo (testssi.ssi) does NOT work, neither do my own SSI pages. Perl and all CGI scripts work fine.

I've tried all suggestions from Ewen and others in the past, it just won't work! Can someone please help?!? Thanks...

Hi i recently found i had this problem too
ssi worked fine till i upgraded to 2.5b4 and i found myself with someone
wanting to use ssi last week and not only was it not working but it was
looking for xixssi on d drive while xitami resides on c drive and then it
was showing an error and closing .

the fix was to upgrade to 2.5b5 works just fine now.

one thing though i was testing on the users page and found it coded for *nix
they had used backticks in the ssi line while windows seems to need speech
marks eg
<!--file=`/filename`--> instead of <!--file="/filename"-->

As I was playing around with IE, I noticed that the headers contain some
extremely useful data that my CGI-based applications could use.  I have
this interesting idea that Xitami could do something horribly non-standard
and pass all of the headers onto my CGI (filter) through another
environment variable.  Here is what I propose:

1)  Create a configuration file option to turn on/off the COMPLETE_HEADERS
environment variable.
2)  During runtime, if the environment variable option is on, then the
COMPLETE_HEADERS variable is created.  Xitami stores the headers into the
environment variable as a zero-terminated URL encoded string.

Of particular interest to me (and probably a few others) are the headers:

UA-pixels: 1152x864
UA-color: color16
UA-OS: Windows NT
UA-CPU: x86

Now, I could use JavaScript to do what I want on the client end of things,
but it would be nice to just grab and parse the headers for the information
I need rather than play with cookies (we all know how much we love cookies
:)) or other similar mechanism (cookies are easier).  The only problem with
both methods is that the user might turn the headers off.  It doesn't
matter, except that the server-side method is a lot easier to code than the
cookie or JavaScript methods.

Just an idea...

Try reading the official definition of HTTP v1.1 (in RFC 2068 et seq) and
you'll discover that those "headers" are completely non-standard and will
be found only on requests coming from some of the computers that have
been blessed with Mr Gates's crap.

It's just another example of Redmond "inventing" an "extension" to a
standard in order to suborn the world into using Windoze, when those
standards were designed for interoperability between ANY computer
systems.  Such extensions are best ignored.

Besides, the principle of good web page design dictate that the page
should present itself in a manner that clearly communicates its
information content to the reader, independently of any paramters such as
those above.  Remember "This page is optimized for ANY browser" is the
best precept.

What is the "them" you are referring to?  If you bought a server, there is
only a single node on the network.  If you are attempting to interface the
server with a current lan to provide a single connection to get to the
internet, you need to set up gateway information on the machines on the lan
to point to the right place.

If you are running Xitami on the server and the server has two network
cards (what I suspect you are doing), the server's network cards need to
have their own individual IP addresses or the requests coming in will get
messed up.  To load-balance the requests, I suggest purchasing a
load-balancing switch rather than messing with a software-based solution
(really messy if you ask me).  That way, if you get another server later,
you can offload some of the load onto the newer server.

Also, the IP addresses of the network cards have to be real IP addresses on
the internet (or the firewall has to forward all connections on port 80 to
the firewall's IP to the web server).  If you want clients on the lan to
access the internet through the server (via a proxy), you have to assign
one network card with a LAN IP (10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x number, depending
on which you use) and the other with a valid internet address.  You can't
just assign the internet address whatever you feel like using unless you
have a static IP (in which case you have to use that IP and nothing else).

Without more information on what exactly you are trying to accomplish with
the server and how Xitami fits into this, this list can't really help you
very much.

Running V2.5b5 on NT 4.0 my browsers don't reload the page when 
it has changed. I use IE 5.5 and Netscape 4.7. I have to force the 
refresh or reload before I can see the changed page. (This is ctl-
refresh in IE or shift-reload in Netscape.)

I know only that this has something to do with the file date. Is Xitami 
not sending the date to the browser? I can see that the date has 
changed in NT explorer.

Typically, browsers don't even check every time, unless you
change the defaults (which are designed for speed, not
up-to-dateness). 

In NetScape 4.5+: 

 Edit, Preferences, Advanced, Cache, 
 "Document in cache is compared to document on network..."
  - EVERY time 
 (the "once per session" and "never" options are no good for
web    authors).

Paul,

Thanks for that tip, but I set those options long ago! And I just 
checked them to make sure something didn't get reset to "factory 
defaults" (aka brain-dead defaults!) They do sort of defeat the whole 
purpose of the web. ie up-to-date information, let alone any sort of 
web authoring, as you mentioned!

I was having problems with both browsers as well until I added some meta tags:

<meta http-equiv="expires" content="0">
<meta http-equiv="pragma" content="no-cache">

In theory this tells the browser to not cache anything and that the
document expires immediately.  I haven't had problems with updating normal
content, but Netscape won't refresh images when they change if they are
available in the cache.

Now, there would be a useful utility:  something that resides in the system
tray and when you right-click, you can flush the memory and disk caches of
IE and Netscape.  I'll bet something like that exists...hmm...guess not
(searched both ZDnet.com and download.com).  Anyone up to the task?  Disk
caches are fairly easy, memory caches are another story.

No, though there is a trick. If the Height= or Width= has
changed, NetScape thinks it is a new image. As a web-wacker you
can change Height=200 to Height=201, and see the change. But you
better change it back.

The other way is to right-click on the stale image, "Open in new
window", you'll get the stale image but shift-reload forces that
image to get fresh (without having to reload -all- the images on
the page). Then Back gets you the full page with the fresh image. 

Dennis >  I set those options long ago! 

OK, I believe you. While I rarely have problems seeing my
changes, I too have had to force it sometimes.

Are there any proxy servers or caches along the way? AOL in
particular caches pages their customers have requested, in case
another AOL user asks for the same page soon after. Thomas's
meta-tags *may* force AOL's caches to read a new copy every time
(though I thought AOL needed no-cache in the HTTP header, not the
HTML file). Other ISPs also cache to reduce load; my school had
to cache for a few months while one of the two outside lines was
down for repair and traffic on the other line was clogged.
Caching a few hundred of the student's favorite external sites
really took the edge off the overload.

Subject: [Xitami] CGI Perl search engine
In-Reply-To: <993878169@coconutcomm.com>

Anyone know of any good perl script search engines that do not require mySQL?
(for my Xitami site running http://www.tahoecabinrentals.com)
If you have an one running on your site, if you could provide the url so I can
see it and the script, and provide the script name and where you d/l'd it
from.

Thanks all!

Since this is coming from a form - create a hidden field which is 
populated by Javascript. The JS can query the browser for those fields. 
This works with all browsers and is trivial to implement and you don't 
need any cookies.

For example

<form name=myForm><script>
  document.writeln('<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="hiddenObject" VALUE="' +
     screen.width + "," + screen.height + "," +
     screen.pixelDepth + "," + screen.colorDepth + "'>" )
</script>
rest of form </form>
