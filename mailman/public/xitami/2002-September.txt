Have you run vcvars32.bat from the directory that MSVSP is installed at?

Hope this helps!

Thanks Thomas that helped a bit,  now I just need to work out how to set the
environments for the compiler in the autoexec.bat.

When I run the build I get a

Checking for required files...
lcc directory not found or compiler not yet defined - aborting

Thanks for your help, I am not really familar with MS Visual C, I am usually
compiling in linux, But I like the xitami webserver for my personal use and
just really want to mess with the cgi and perl stuff.......

The 'lcc' error sounds like the configuration is set up incorrectly for
Visual Studio and is looking for a Linux compiler of some sort.  'cl.exe'
is the command-line compiler for MSVC++.  You might also need 'ml.exe'
which can be found in the Windows 98 DDK (the DDK is free).

Hope this helps!

Use a workaround if nothing else helps.
Put the following in some ever available header or config file:

function scriptname($buffer) {
         $buff_array = explode("/", $buffer);
         $i = count($buff_array);
         $i--;
         $scriptname = $buff_array[$i];
         return $scriptname;
}

$php_self = scriptname($SCRIPT_NAME);

tony

Hey I just went round in a circle I can run the 98DDK compiler but this
build.bat keeps returnin the exact same error message Cl not define or ML
not define which ever i use in the autoexec.bat

probably something obvious here

SET CCNAME=ml
SET CCDIR=e:\vc98\98ddk\bin\win98
SET INCDEF=e:\vc98\98ddk\INC\win98
SET LIBDIR=e:\vc98\sfl

If you're looking for a free Windows mail server,
The only one I know of is Mercury:

Not sure what you mean by "works with Xitami" ...
but it does work fine along side Xitami.

There are no mail servers that work with Xitmai.  Xitami is a web and 
ftp server only.

Now scripting language which operate within Xitami work with mail 
servers, as well as sql servers and just about any server you can think 
of..  Try www.serverwatch.com for mail servers.

I'm assuming you mean Xitami for Windows. I have had good luck with 
"Internet Anywhere" mail server. I use an older version, but it has 
served me with well with Xitami on a pitiful P133/Win98 "server" for 
about 2 or 3 years now.


It is a standard pop3/SMTP server that has relay control, mailing list 
support, and even a web-based remote configuration tool, if that's what 
you want.

Hi all,

You could always run XMail (http://www.xmailserver.org/) along with Xitami, 
an robust open-source cross-platform mail server.

I have Xitami and IA EMail Server (www.tnsoft.com) working on the same machine.
But any 'working together' will have to be scripted according to your

If PHP files can be routed through a parsing filter (php.exe), is there a 
way to utilize server-side javascript with Xitami?

Secondly, shouldn't I be able to route a webpage (with a special 
extension, of course, i.e., index.perl) through a perl parser?  If so, is 
one way of performing this by installing the ISAPI Support and 
PerlSAPI?

... just stuff floating through my head...

If you turn Register_Globals which you should for
security sakes the code would be:

$_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] = $_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]

Subject: [Xitami] [Xitami 2.5.x: Automatic Translation .html -> .htm does not work
Message-ID: <3D7A2D30.74E9CB1A@gmx.net>

Hello !

The documentation says
> note that
>      xitami automatically looks for .html extensions if a .htm file is not found. 

With Xitami 2.4.x, especially this works perfectly:

The file
anything.htm
can be addressed as
http://path/anything.htm
and
http://path/anything.html

This was and is a great feature for me, as I still maintain my local
website with files with filenames in the 8+3 scheme,
as if I keep it I may edit the files within a DOS box with a plain MSDOS
editor !
and if I upload by WS_FTP, there is an automatic translation from .htm
to .html !

***** Now with Xitami 2.5.x, this never worked. ***** 
This is true for the current 2.5b5 too.

The  file
anything.htm
, if addressed as
http://path/anything.html
is displayed as plain text file, i.e. you see the HTML layout commands.

Even though I gave feedback to the developers 
xitami@imatix.com 
at 22 Jan 2001, maybe this was TOO late as the development process still
had stopped.

So as Xitami is now on with a fresh new mailing list, I have another
try.

As long as this bug is not fixed, I'll be using 2.4.x, as this is a
major bug which prevents me from keeping my 8+3 naming scheme and
maintaining the files with a plain MSDOS editor.

Btw, may anybody tell me how to configure any other free WEB server
(Apache,..) to support that special translation feature ?

Sincerely
Rolf

This is a very old problem but I finally stumbled on the solution and wanted
to share it with anyone that wants or even remembers the problem...

The solution ended up testing the MTU setting on my connection. Using this
number, I changed the MTU setting in the router.

ping -f -l 1454 192.168.1.1

I dropped the mtu number until I got a successful ping reply.

Lo and behold, it is now available for all to see.

Thanks for everyone's suggestions.

Just wondering where the status of 2.5 was - seems that neither it nor
2.4 have been updated in quite a while.  The main concerns from my users
would probably be remedied by http 1.1 compatibility which would allow
them to resume files, etc.  The bandwidth limiting that was implemented
in 2.5 would also be very handy for some of my virtual hosts.

The last time I tried the 2.5 beta though, virtual hosts were rather
broken (my 2.4 virtual host config didn't work in 2.5).  Any word on if
development on 2.5 is continuing?  I've been with Xitami for about 3
years now, and I really don't want to have to install a new server when
this one is so small and elegant.

Dave.

This is more likely because of some changes in the configuration file 
syntax between the two versions.

It's continuing.  It is just going somewhat slower than everyone

don't install multiple versions of Xitami.

xitami.cfg/defaults.cfg

[Virtual-Hosts]
  www.myhost.com=c:\webpages\myhost.com\vhost.cfg

vhost.cfg contains only the settings from xitami.cfg as needed.

like

[Server]
  webpages=c:\webpages\mhost.com\htdocs\

there was a bug in 2.5 beta. if you can compile xitami for yourself, i
can give you the patched sourcs.

Don't install a second copy of Xitami, since both programs will try to use
the same ports.

STEP 1:
In the file default.cfg add: (virtual host name=config file name)

[Virtual-hosts]
     Mail.verfaillie.com=mail.cfg

STEP 2:
Create a mail.cfg file containing the path to the root directory of the VH:

[Server]
     webpages=webpages/mail                   #   Relative or full path

All these steps can also be performed from within the webadmin, if enabled.
Go to Xitami administration, click on virtual hosts, click new, enter
identifier name, the webpages root dir, save and that's it for simple VH.

Hi All:

Thanks for your help in advance.

I am compiling Xitami 2.4 under Linux 2.4.18 and am having problems with the
script.  I fails saying bad interpreter and it also doesn't find the
compiler within the script.  From the command line however I can call the
compiler and the shell.  I reviewed c scripts they said to modify and it is
all spaghetti to me.  Nothing to denote where and what to modify.

Hopeless in DC.

Message-ID: <OFC5811466.C73B227E-ON85256C2F.0067C011@teal.com>

Hello,

I would like to know if anyone has experienced this problem and if there is
any possible solution.

The problem is with my "xitami server based application program on a laptop
with windows 2000"
The problem begins when xitami server starts the cgi program and causes the
winlogon.exe (from windows 2000)
to start running and using up %70+ CPU processing time (for several
seconds) which in turn slows down my cgi
program significantly. This problem does not occur on a desktop!!

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [Xitami] How do I make files executable in Xitami?
Message-ID: <QOTNHUSHDDBRLNH04PMUPO61IHNJR.3d7e8fc0@midpoint>


Hi. =)  Silly newbie questions..  My webservice provide just installed php and mySQL on his Xitami server. I 
have two scripts that I want to run. 

One is a content managent system and the other is an image indexing program called gallery.  Both programmes 
will run in both UNIX and Windows.  I'm only familliar with UNIX servers and "chmod"ing files to make them 
executable.

I get this error message:  "Bad request: probably tried to POST a non-executable URL"  I did a little digging 
in to the lists archives and I've found reference to perl scripts being executable from the cgi-bin directory.  
So, I made a cgi-bin and uploaded the files there.. I use the same path as the ftp, but I get this message: 
"The URL you asked for does not exist on this website."  I suppose I need to be given access to the cgi-bin?   
Well I suppose my question would be: are php scripts executable from the cgi-bin? 
 
I downloaded Xitami and installed it on my computer and have been trying to get php installed--but it's not 
working.

I got a similar problem when my server was dual hosted: it tried to log on
to some other computer. Only after time-out (30 seconds) did the real
application start.
Check that there is no dial up or remote access active.

Hiyall,

Any machine that can run XP will serve big files via Xitami VERY
well.

I had Xitami running on a 386SX-16Mhz, with a 15 Meg file for test
downloads, and people outside campus could not tell it from a
Pentium server. Xitami is very efficient, and the network is usually
the bottleneck.

Hello,

A question about the lrwp test app.  I run xitami, everything is fine.

I start 'mega' which is a compilation of the unmodified testlrwp.c.  'lcgi'
registers with xitami and diplays:

LRWP has served us well.  We've been using the Xitami V2.4d7 release for quite awhile.
This problem came about because we're upgrading to the V2.4d9 release.  We were going 
through the standard compilation of Xitami on the target (QNX 6.2, it works fine on 6.0) 
and the testlrwp.cc.

Another question, in the above access.log, why is there a 304 for every HTTP request?
Is there a configuration parameter that causes this behavior?

-Thanks
Joe

/lcgi doesn't work, /mega does. hmm. don't know if there are any
changes in the protocol syntax between 2.4d4 and d9

304 means "not modified". if your browser has the most recent copy of
the graphics and webpages in the cache, xitami will return an 304
instead of the requested data.

you cannot switch off xitamis caching behaviour (only for the files
configured with "default1=..." to disable caching of your default files
like /index.html"

to disable caching try smthttpl.c line 2139 :

if (p_http-> default_page
  && *HCONFIG ("server:cache-defaults") == '0')
   return;

  Hello friends,

  I've been running the free version of zone alarm on my system for a year 
now, with no problems at all.  I guess I eventually just got all the 
settings the way they needed to be, because I really don't know allot about 
it.. Anyway, I recently upgraded to the newer (still free) version, and I 
sure wish I hadn't!!  I can't get it set right, I don't know enough about 
it, and it's driving me crazy..  When I set it at any decent level of 
security, people can't get into my web site..  Of course if any of you can 
offer an easy way to set Zone Alarm I would sure appreciate it, but my real 
question is this.  Is there an easy way of setting up a good security for my 
web site (using xitami), to help prevent hacks, etc.. but will NOT interfere 
with traffic?? I am really a dummy with this!  At one time, I thought I saw 
a small program that acted kind of like a fire-wall, but just logged 
attempts, etc.. Any help with this is greatly appreciated, and I apologize 
for the long post!  Have a good day all!

  John

firewalls are easy if you try to understand what a firewall should do,
can do and cannot do (eg. managing your coffee machine and your debts).

Peter,

The NT service version 2.4d9 has been rock solid for me on XP Professional.  I tried the 9X/NT system tray version of 2.4d9 and it would crash every 36 hours or so, 
so avoid that one.

Hope this helps,
Ken

Tiny Software (www.tinysoftware.com) makes a software firewall for Windows that I've found works well with XP also. It's free for home use, a business license is about 40 bucks.

firewalls are easy if you try to understand what a firewall should do,

When the new version of Zone Alarm came out my Xitami on my NT 
machine stopped working.  However I had a copy of Norton Personal 
Firewall from my Mindspring days.  I have been very pleased with 
Norton firewall and it is fast/simple to configure.

Will using something like * work with virtual
hosts?

So, for instance instead of using 

www.mydomain.com=mydomain.cfg
mydomain.com=mydomain.cfg

to get those domains working, could I instead use:
*.mydomain.com=mydomain.cfg    

If I could do this then it would make making
configuration files much much easier.

Subject: [Xitami] Individual password protection
Message-ID: <F64WIgRLNTaFagA34pf0000252e@hotmail.com>

  Hey all,

  You all answered my question a while back about being able to password 
protect more than one section of the site, but I have another question 
please.  I need to be able to allow each member to have thier own page, and 
only "their" password would get them there. The way I see xitami supporting 
passwords, is that as long as you have a u/name and p/word, you can get into 
"all" protected areas.  It would be really great if I could have only one 
link to the log-in, and each members password would direct them to their 
page.  However, I can get by with giving each member their own link to the 
log-in script.. Is there a fairly easy way of doing this? Thanks to you all, 
you are all very helpful to everyone! Have a good day!

  John

  I have downloaded and installed "Tiny" and it appears to be doing it's

Subject: [Xitami] lrwp test program and QNX
Message-ID: <CB1E57AFC4F3314FA9F11429E309673E176B6F@cawhqexch01.caw.com>

Hello,

Having upgraded to 6.2 QNX OS, recompiled Xitami and it runs fine.
I did not have to modify anything...  (Using 6.0 the scripts had to
be modified to get a proper build)

The next step was to compile the testlrwp.c program.  It compiled fine
and starts fine.

The problem is that I can browse webpages, cgi's everything else, but if
I browse the lrwp get a 403.

Is there anythin that needs to be done on QNX that will allow access
to the lrwp??

Thanks,
-Joe

Hi,

It's really easy to do this.
Just edit your Xitami.aut file and add some entries like this:

[page1_folder]
	team1=passw1
	realm=page1_folder

[page2_folder]
	team2=passw2
	realm=page2_folder

etc.

Then create the corresponding folders page1_folder, page2_folder, etc....
Optionally you can put an index.htm in these folders so when going to

http://your-site.com/page1_folder you'll get a default page after the
username team1 and the password passw1 have been entered.


There are some default entries in xitami.aut which you might want to delete
(#[Private], Jacky=robusta#    Jonas=realtime  Sarah=arabica etc.).


Good luck

Stefan

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20020920212825.00a371e0@mail.sexcitymall.com>

Hi,

I am running unders Windows ME

I have set up Xitami which seems to be running fine

Have set up cute ftp to connect to 127.0.0.1 using my chosen
username and password that I was asked to input when going into
the admin section of Xitami for the first time

Whilst I can log on to my local server I am unable to access any
of the files that were set up automatically when I installed
Xitami

These files include

private
cgi-bin
cgi-bin/testcgi

I am connecting using HyperText transfer protocol using port 80

(see error log below)

Also tried running cgi-bin/testcgi no luck there either

I thought maybe the directory needed chmod but it does not
but when clicking ion the chmod it just gives you the directory
description but no option to chmod


No doubt I am missing something very basic here, can you please tell
me what I am doing wrong

Regards
Mel

Subject: [Xitami] XItami & Active Perl on Win 2000 - CGI Script Problems
Message-ID: <013801c2611e$b9cb0b40$31b4fea9@wildthing>

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

Beginner here! Running Win 2000 SP2.
I've set up a local Xitami web server, then installed Active Perl (both =
latest versions downloaded within the last week). During the Active Perl =
installation, I selected Xitami as the web server to automatically =
configure.
When I tried a simple Perl script:

#!F:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -wT

print "Content-type:text/html\n\n";
print "Show me the money! The Active PERL interpreter is working with my =
web server!";

the printed content shows up in my browser, leading me to believe that =
Perl is working. However, when I try to use a HTML page like:

<html>
<head>
 <title>Animal</title>
</head>
<body>
<form action=3D"animal.cgi" METHOD=3DPOST>
Which animal? <INPUT type=3D"text" name=3D"animal">
<P><INPUT type=3D"submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>

to pass a string to a CGI script like:

#!F:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -wT
use strict;
use CGI ':standard';

my $animal;
$animal =3D param('animal');

print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "Show me the $animal";

the result is a blank page.=20
When I view->source for the blank page, I get:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D"text/html; =
charset=3Dwindows-1252"></HEAD>
<BODY></BODY></HTML>

As stated, I'm new to all this and don't know what to try next.=20
I had a similar problem getting PHP to work which was solved by adding =
an entry to Xitami's Defaults.cfg file under the [mime] heading. Is =
there an entry I must add to get Perl/CGI scripts going as well?

Any help gratefully accepted!

Hiyall,


I have Xitami running on XP pro serving only large mp3 files of about =
50-100 mbs in size.=20

I noticed this morning in the xitami folder there was a hughe file =
called "memtrace.lst" of about 380 mbs in size, and its this file that =
would not allow my pc to restart untill i had booted to DOS and then =
deleted this massive file. This has happend to me bfore. except the file =
was 500 mbs!! How did xitami create this file and how can i safeguard =
against this happening again.
I have a a partition where D:\ contains all my mp3's and C:\ is for =
xitami and my ftp.

??

memtrace.lst is created when Xitami detects an internal problem while
deallocating memory.

when xitami is running as an NT service it may create this dump file
when it detects a memory leak.

i guess this file contains a dump of all memory allocated by Xitami.

This is a follow-up to my previous post requesting help with the subject =
combination. In the first post, I listed the content of a simple web =
page passing a short string to a simple CGI script. I very probably =
should have stated this the first time around, but the page and script =
work fine if the script is served from the web server provided by the =
author of the book where these beginner examples are published. So, I =
don't believe the script itself is the problem.
I have tried some suggestions offered by helpful people with the =
following results:

"Put the complete URL of the Web Server being asked to serve the CGI in =
the action line of the web page."
Works correctly if I use the book author's URL, still fails when I try =
to use my local Xitami installation (get a blank page)

"Active Perl only interprets .pl files, not .cgi."
Changed the extension of animal.cgi to animal.pl. No difference noted. =
Still get a blank page. If I change the extension on the simple, =
self-contained script that *will* run, it runs equally well with either =
.cgi or .pl as the extension.

"Study the Xitami ducumentation for settings that might accect your =
situation."
I've looked at the documentation for both Xitami and ActivePerl, and =
(probably because I very inexperienced) don't see anything that looks =
like a possible solution. ActivePerl *claims* to automatically configure =
Xitami during installation, but I suspect the configuration is not quite =
complete.

Other symptoms noted:
Sometimes, after a failed attempt to call a CGI from a web page, the =
Xitami icon in my system tray has changed from green to yellow. On other =
occasions, the icon is still green after a failed attempt, but Xitami =
has "stopped responding".
Other things tried:
I have syntax checked the offending scripts in Perl and no errors are =
reported.

I'm probably not describing all this very well, so if there is other =
specific information needed for further analysis, please tell me and =
I'll try to get it.

Any suggestions much appreciated!

This is what is showing in the Xitmai archives

<html>
<head>
 <title>Animal</title>
</head>
<body>
<form action=3D"animal.cgi" METHOD=3DPOST>
Which animal? <INPUT type=3D"text" name=3D"animal">
<P><INPUT type=3D"submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>
<form action=3D"animal.cgi" METHOD=3DPOST>
changed this line to
<form action="/cgi-bin/animal.cgi" METHOD=POST>
and it worked
Although I see you posted in HTML not good here on the list :)

Wow! I have no idea how all the 3D's got in there. Here's from my original
post:
Any ideas what caused the strange alterations?

Begin:
#!F:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -wT

print "Content-type:text/html\n\n";
print "Show me the money! The Active PERL interpreter is working with my web
server!";

the printed content shows up in my browser, leading me to believe that Perl
is working. However, when I try to use a HTML page like:

<html>
<head>
 <title>Animal</title>
</head>
<body>
<form action="animal.cgi" METHOD=POST>
Which animal? <INPUT type="text" name="animal">
<P><INPUT type="submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>

to pass a string to a CGI script like:

#!F:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -wT
use strict;
use CGI ':standard';

my $animal;
$animal = param('animal');

print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "Show me the $animal";

the result is a blank page.
When I view->source for the blank page, I get:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<META http-equiv=Content-Type content="text/html;
charset=windows-1252"></HEAD>
<BODY></BODY></HTML>

End:

OK. I tried that and still get the empty page.
Sounds like you have an Xitami/Active Perl setup?
Would you be so kind as to share the contents of your defaults.cfg in your
Xitami directory?
I did add to mine to support PHP, and am now wondering if the addition of:

[mime]
php-application/xhttpd-php4

and

[filter]
.php=C:\PHP\php.exe

has somehow interfered with calling of CGI's?

You might want to do to the CGI.PM homepage and download the examples 
and stick them in \xitami\cgi-bin\examples. Then try running one of them 
(e.g http://localhost/cgi-bin/examples/tryit.cgi)

I have never used ActivePerl's setup options but I have never had a 
problem running Win2k + Xitami + ActivePerl

[Cgi]
    Debug = "1"
    Exit-ok = "0"
    Form-query = "1"
    Full-name = "1"
    Timeout = "120"
    Wildcard = "1"
[Filter]
    .php = "c:\\php\\php.exe"
    .phps = "C:\\php\\php.exe -s"
    .phtml = "C:\\php\\php.exe"
    .shtm = "perlssi"
    .shtml = "perlssi"
    .ssi = "perlssi"

[Ssi]
    Enabled = "1"
    Exec = "1"
[Win32]
    16bit-cgi = "1"
    Service-name = "Xitami"
    Service-text = "Xitami Web Server"

Ok now you can add to the Autoexec.bat
SET PATH=F:\PERL\BIN;%PATH%

Next check your
cgierr.log file that is in the xitami directory

Xitami on windows look for Peal in the PATH;

OK, $Bill, the answers are in context. Again thank you for trying to help.
Since I last posted, I uninstalled and reinstalled both Xitami and
ActivePerl, just to be sure the extra settings for PHP were not the culprit.
As the results are still the same with the default install, I guess the PHP
settings in defaults.cfg are exonerated.
One thing I find a bit strange about the Xitami install is that no cgi-bin
directory is created by the install. I have to make one myself. Is this
normal?

Thanks very much Patricko!
I'll get to work on the mods and see what happens. I already had perl in my
path, so that part's done.

Hello All,

 Just a couple of dumb questions. Where do you make the cgi-bin
 directory and what goes in it to test the CGI? I have a cgi-src, but
 no cgi-bin directory under "C:\Program Files\Xitami"

Best regards,
 Magus

Hello All,

 Just a couple of dumb questions. Where do you make the cgi-bin
 directory and what goes in it to test the CGI? I have a cgi-src, but
 no cgi-bin directory under "C:\Program Files\Xitami"

AFAIK, the cgi-bin has to be created by you (I had to, every time I've
installed Xitami). Put it directly under your Xitami directory. That's where
Perl/CGI expects to find your .cgi and .pl scripts. I have successfully run
a simple CGI from this directory by simply putting the URL in my browser,
e.g. http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/perltest.cgi.
HTH!

I'm afraid I threw you a red herring on the log content.
I cleared all log content, then restarted Xitami and accessed animal.html,
then called animal.cgi.
The log content:

cgierr.log - empty

use CGI::Carp "fatalsToBrowser";

 add the above to you animal.cgi

do you have extended debug mode turned on this may help
if so check your xitami/tmp for pipe###.cgo and pipe###/cgi
see if a clue is in there

make sure the she-bang line is the top left no spaces

although that usally is an internal server error
did you check permistions what does your event file show ?

My install.log has no such entry. Strange. I'll have to try to contact
Xitami by a more direct means to address this phenomenon.

No, but I'm about to do several things.

Would not surprise me. I have a spare PC at work that I can play with.
Uninstall all AT&T stuff, try a different browser, etc.
I very much appreciate your efforts. I'll probably no reappear for a few
days until several of your suggestions have been tried.

Thanks for the suggestions, Patricko 8).
Add in the line made no difference. I did turn on something called
additional logs? thet produced no additional output.
The pipe files you mentioned do not appear in my temp directory.
As I mentioned to $BIll, I'm going to work through all this on a different
PC at work this week, where possibly problematical software can be purged.

Yes.

Find a very old copy of Xitami, it creates a cgi-bin and drops a
sample file that prints the environment.

That sample script could be considered a security risk, so they took
it out of the system. The next time they built the archive, their
clever tool noticed that the cgi-bin directory was empty, and didn't
include it in the distribution.

I've looked at the rest of the thread and do not see why it isn't
working. Since non-Form scripts work, we know Perl is being found.

hi all,

I'm wondering what the best way is to crete "sub-domains."  that is, I have
my DNS acount pointing www.domain.com and *.domain.com to my xitami server
now which then points to the default home page for my sight.  cool.

but how do I then point subdomain.domain.com to a different web page on my
server?

Is this the same as setting virtual hosts?

thanks,

Michael I think this is what your looking for to set the path to the web
page of the subdomain


When you set-up a virtual host, you will generally want to use a specific
directory for the web pages, CGI scripts, password file, and log files. (You
can also share these in any way you need to.) You can also configure options
such as the HTTP error messages, timeouts, security, and so on.

To define these, you specify a configuration file per virtual host. The
virtual host configuration inherits all definitions from defaults.cfg (and
xitami.cfg). You need only define those options that are specific to the
virtual host. If the HTTP request refers to a host name or IP address that
has not been configured as a virtual host, the request is handled by the
base host. To configure the base host, create a file called 'basehost.cfg'.
You can change this name in the defaults.cfg file server:base-host option.

This is a typical configuration for a site with several virtual hosts:

[Server]
    webpages=websites/hostx/webpages
    cgi-bin=websites/hostx/cgi-bin

Some of the options in the [Server] apply to the entire server globally, and
are not taken from the virtual host configuration file: background,
customise, debug, limit, portbase, and refresh.

Message-ID: <CB1E57AFC4F3314FA9F11429E309673E176B71@cawhqexch01.caw.com>

The following code:

	sprintf(buf, "%s\xFF%s\xFF", "foo", "bar");

should result in the following characters in buf: 'f', 'o', 'o', 0xff, 'b', 'a', 'r', 0xff.  
But what actually appears is: 'f', 'o', 'o', 0xff, '%', 's', 0xff.  


The lrwplib code contains this sprintf:

	sprintf(buf, "%s\xFF%s\xFF%s", appname, vhost?vhost:"", "");

which I changed to:

	sprintf(buf, "%s%c%s%c%s", appname, 0xff, vhost?vhost:"", 0xff, "");

The reason the 403 was thrown is that the registration of the peer process
name was garbled.  Xitami was doing regular GET processing on the url that
specified the lrwp peer process.

After changing the sprintf everything worked.

I did not check the Xitami source for other *printf calls that use 'xFF'
in the format specifier.

Hello,

Having upgraded to 6.2 QNX OS, recompiled Xitami and it runs fine.
I did not have to modify anything...  (Using 6.0 the scripts had to
be modified to get a proper build)

The next step was to compile the testlrwp.c program.  It compiled fine
and starts fine.

The problem is that I can browse webpages, cgi's everything else, but if
I browse the lrwp get a 403.

Is there anythin that needs to be done on QNX that will allow access
to the lrwp??

Thanks,

Message-ID: <D34BD7425937D61183720002A54207902B839F@EU1BERNTD01>

Hi, everybody 
I'm new here and I was not able to access the archive address given by
Xitami in the manual. So I don't know, how much has been said about SSI so
far. My problem is :
I set up a Xitami installation as a test system for intranet pages on my
local PC which works fine for normal html-pages, JavaScript included. I
installed ActivePerl, test.pl from the DOS command line works well. Then I
made an html-page which contains the following SSI-tags 
"
<!--#include virtual ="cnh_header.html"-->
<!--#include file ="cnh_header.html"-->
"
, called the file "*.ssi", and the only response I get back from the
Xitami-server is:
"
#include file not found: 

[perlssi: "#include virtual ="cnh_header.html"" produced errors] 

#include file not found: 

[perlssi: "#include file ="cnh_header.html"" produced errors] 
"
"cnh_header.html" is a file in the webpages directory containing our
corporate logo and the date (produced by a JavaScript script). It is
displayed without problems when I call it directly as an html-file in the
browser (as well with as without the basic html-tags <html>,<body>). It also
works with other intranet pages hosted by our corporate web server, but all
my efforts to make the Xitami-server work with it were not successful.

Anybody to know something about that?

Subject: [Xitami] PHP/Xitami timeout.
Message-ID: <3D900420.128.25C118C5@localhost>

    Ever since I have installed PHP for OS/2 I have noticed some occasional odd 
behaviour in Xitami.  I am wondering if there there may be a setting I need to adjust to 
get this running smoothly?  I recently upgraded my server to a K6-2 550 to speed up 
some PHP apps mainly thumbnail creation with GD and faster reloading in the 
occasional server reset.  I use smartbar.exe to see what threads are doing what and 
using what % of cpu time.  I've noticed two different effects.  

When I run a php script photo frame (photoframe.sourceforge.net) PHP loads and uses 
about %60 of the cpu time generating thumbnails and then exits.  About 1 in 4 times 
Xitami roughly several seconds later spikes taking %100 to 99.6% of the cpu time for a 
couple seconds to sometimes as long as two minuets.  During this time Xitami times out 
on all connections.  Also about 1 in 4 times Xitami stays at about .3% to .6% cpu 
utilization but still refuses connections for roughly the same time frame.

Are there any timeout settings I need to be careful with?  Or something possibly 
interfering with Xitami?

Thanks Gene

Thanks very much for that information, Paul. Now I know it's not the
manually-created cgi-bin.
As a further confusing factor, I found a CGI script that generates HTML form
objects, asks the user to enter info, then displays the results. This works
fine in my setup:

#!C:\perl\bin\perl.exe

use CGI qw(:standard);

print header;
print start_html('A Simple Example'),
    h1('A Simple Example'),
    start_form,
    "What's your name? ",textfield('name'),
    p,
    "What's the combination?",
    p,
    checkbox_group(-name=>'words',
     -values=>['eenie','meenie','minie','moe'],
     -defaults=>['eenie','minie']),
    p,
    "What's your favorite color? ",
    popup_menu(-name=>'color',
        -values=>['red','green','blue','chartreuse']),
    p,
    submit,
    end_form,
    hr;

if (param()) {
    print
 "Your name is ",em(param('name')),
 p,
 "The keywords are: ",em(join(", ",param('words'))),
 p,
 "Your favorite color is ",em(param('color')),
 hr;
}
print end_html;

As far as not seeing anything out of whack, join the club 8).
 As I type this, I'm downloading an alternative browser to try, but am not
optimistic it will make any difference. I'm beginning to think about
networking settings and what, if anything, there might cause the output from
a CGI (or .pl) script) not to appear in the browser. It seems (to my
simplistic way of thinking) that the output cannot find its way back to the
browser when a script is called from a HTML page? As I find no messages in
the cgierr or error logs, I am (at this stage) assuming the script is run.

Thanks very much! I'll try that as soon as my "new browser" download ends
(darn dialup connection!).
To get PHP working, I had to add a [Mime] section as follows to
defaults.cfg. Is there, by any chance, an entry needed for Perl/CGI? If so,
what is the syntax?

[Mime]
    Php-application/x-httpd-php4

Uh oh!
I'm now answering myself (not a good sign).
I downloaded and installed the Mozilla browser to try with Xitami and got
the same disappointing results, so I guess we can exonerate IE6. I also
downloaded and tried both Sambar and Ohttpd (both Windows web servers).
After getting them configured to accept the .pl scripts I've shown before, I
tried the HTML calling .pl combination in them. Same empty page returned!
I also installed and tried all this with Xitami and ActivePerl on two other
PC's (in both Win 98 SE and Win 2000). One is my work PC connected to the
campus network, the other, a spare, completely isolated from any network or
internet connection (in case those factors came to bear on the situation).
In all cases, no errors logged, even with Xitami debugging turned on. It
seems the output from the called .pl script is going into the electronic
black hole, somehow.
I also tried adding to defaults.cfg under [Filters]

.pl=c:\Perl\bin\perl.exe

which changed nothing.

Of course, any further ideas/suggestions gratefully accepted.
Thanks again to all who are trying!

Oh yes! I've started talking to myself 8).

I just tried it. Exactly the same blank page is returned.

Ah, just figured out you mean my \Windows\Temp directory?

I don't see those file names, but I *do* see pipe0014.cgo and pipe0014.cgi
(along with several pairs with lower numbers) The .cgi has in it (if I use
POST, if I use GET the file is empty) animal=bird. The .cgo is empty. There
is also a like-named .flt file which is also empty.
Now, when I run the self-contained cgitest.pl, the .cgi and .cgo contents
are *very* different, and contain (in the case of the .cgo) all the stuff I
want in the browser. Let me guess: this means that the called script is
*not* being run?

>

I use TextPad (great for Java, BTW).

>

I guess so, because I believe we are actually homing in in the problem. One
of the tougher nuts I've tried to crack. Windows C++ application problems
pale by comparison 8).

Thanks once more for sticking with me!

No, it isn't the browser. I hate to exonerate IE, and it will
sometimes throw bogus error messages, but it should work.

PLEASE use the "Carp Fatals To Browser" code Patricko posted. IMHO,
you can not debug these things without it.

Are we allowing file attachments on this list? If so, attached is a
Perl form-handler that works for me. It is called from a form that
supplies the variables "$ENV{FORM_...." and sends an email via the
local host, then prints something for the user to see (either
"Thanks" or "error").

I have clobbered the script name and the shebang so nobody's email
reader tries to Run it. No matter, because I've also clobbered the
mail parameters so you guys won't annoy the person who gets the real
script's emails.

If you fix the shebang, it should at least return a polite error
message. if called from a form with "name" "gender' and "Address1"
fields, it should display them before erroring on the mail-call. If
even that does not work, un-comment the line with "Hello?" and see
if it runs that far.

Anyone have any tips or clues? Perhaps another message board that is

Is there any way to provide file descriptions in the File List directory
with Xitami like there is with Apache?

Thanks

Luck should not be needed. What have you done, and what happens?

Have you installed Perl? Did you go through the first few pages of
the script and followed the configuration instructions?

Yabb was pretty painless to install on my NT 4 machine and has a lot of nice features.  
It's free too.  As far as problems with perl I never figured out how to call a external 
program from perl/php under Xitami.  NT "always" refuses to give up a socket to a 
program perl or php calls and I'm not sure why.  Figure it must be a security feature NT 
has I don't know how to turn off.  98 should not have those problems.  Good luck!

I have been running Xitami here for a few weeks with no problems. Suddenly
today accessing my site (www.k4hw.com) brings up a Network Password dialog
box. I have not been working on it today or anything so I do not know what
is up. Never heard of Cayman-DSL. Any ideas what I could have done?

Thanks

DynSite was not updating ZoneEdit for some reason even though it said it
successfully updated.

Works fine for me. "OCX FOR ICOM RADIOS", I don't want to know
whatever that is. (I actually have a clue, but I'm more a spark-gap
kinda guy.)

Do other sites work for you? "Cayman-DSL" sounds like your DSL ISP
forgot who you are. If so, you probably can't get anywhere.

Thanks Alasdair and Paul,

I think it was ZoneEdit. But I do not know why I had this problem. At any
rate it is ok now.

An exact example might help if you want specifc suggestions.

But essentially the answer is yes. You just edit the httpdir.gsl file in 
/xitami/templates

Wow! A dim light is glowing at the end of the tunnel!
I, too, don't know if attachments are "allowed" here, but I'm very glad you
sent it.
This should take us further down the road to seeing what is wrong in my
situation.
I tool your script, commented out all the mail stuff and tried this:

<animal.html>
<html>
<head>
 <title>Animal</title>
</head>
<body>
<form action="http://localhost/cgi-bin/animal.pl" METHOD=POST>
Which animal? <INPUT type="text" name="animal">
<P><INPUT type="submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>

<animal.pl>
#!C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -w
#

use strict;
use CGI qw(:standard);
use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
print "<HTML>\n";
print "<head><title>The Animal!</title></head>\n";
print "<BODY>\n";
my $animal = param('animal');

print "hello? <br>\n";
print "Thank you for identifying your favorite animal!<p>\n";
print "Your animal is: $animal\n";
print "<BR>";

print "</BODY>\n";
print "</HTML>\n";

This works just fine! Hurrah!! I now have a workaround.
Compare to this version of
<animal.pl>
#!C:\perl\bin\perl.exe -w

use strict;
use CGI qw(:standard);
use CGI::Carp qw(fayalsToBrowser);
my $animal:
$animal = param('animal');

print "Content-type:text/html\n\n";
print "Show me the $animal";

Which still returns the (by now) infamous blank page.
So, it seems to me (newbie, remember!) that the part that does not work is:

print "Content-type:text/html\n\n";

So, is my CGI not producing the needed HTML wrapper around print "Show me
the $animal"; ?
If the .pl script supplies the tags, all is well. Or, so it appears.

Again, thanks very much, Paul, and all the rest of you who have helped me
here. I really appreciate it!
(But, I still want to find out *why* print "Content-type:text/html\n\n";
doesn't work for me 8)).

Don't bother looking into that second version of <animal.pl> I included in
my just-sent message. There are obvious typos.

my $animal:

and

use CGI::Carp qw(fayalsToBrowser);

Once fixed, the script works!

******************* Lesson Learned! ********************

Never, never test scripts without:

use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);

in them!!!!! (Sticks your nose right in the problem)

Again the patience, kindness and expertise you've all shown me is much
appreciated!

First, I'm going to thank you, Patricko, for all the help you provided 8).
Next step is to get with our classroom/lab support staff and have them
install the Xitami/ActivePerl/PHP setup in the appropriate rooms.
Next (remember - no good deed goes unpunished!), I'll make sure all the
students are aware of the mailing lists I joined to get the help I needed
;).
I'm going to keep playing with Perl and PHP and see what additional trouble
I can get into 8).

Mine too. (I fixed them while composing the message but failed to
re-load the changed attachment).

> don't know if attachments are "allowed" here,

There are "issues", so we try to use them carefully or Ewen will
turn off attachments. Such as: on another list, someone sent a SEVEN
MEG attachment (patch file) to a list where 98% of the readers
didn't need the patch. Nearly melted my modem. Executable
attachments are an ongoing problem, and these modern mail-readers
seem to know how to execute about anything without informed consent
from the recipient. And some old grumps (I'm one) aren't real keen
about duplicating the text as pretty-color HTML, or worse: that
wretched encoding that some old OutLooks attached to every email.

But I felt that 2K of example code wasn't too onerous even on modem,
and I tried to make it look like Plain Text so no foolish mail
client would "helpfully" try to Run it.

NEVER, NEVER TEST Perl CGI SCRIPTS WITHOUT:
 1) use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
 2) running with the " -w" option
 3) use Strict;

I am not sure if " -w" (warn) can be forced in the shebang line. It
may need to be set globally in Xitami's Filters setting. Even there,
it may not propagate in all versions of O/S, Perl, and Xitami. So
run the script with -w from a command-line before you finish
testing. While there may be extra errors because it isn't called
with all CGI parameters on hand, you should be able to account for
them. Turning off -w "usually" means there is something wrong with
the script, and any apparent success is dumb luck.

I find no such file as httpdir.gsl or any directory such as

If you thought Perl was fun, PHP is more fun.

I had a script 75% working in Perl in one night when my host told me
I would have to use PHP. (There are political reasons why I'm not
hosting the site I'm scripting.) I've been working for a couple
weeks getting the same functionality in PHP. Mostly learning-curve,
but in some ways PHP is a very messy language.

Ok I think htis is a 2.5 feature not a 2.4 feature - no doubt someone 
will jump in and correct me if I am wrong - so if you are running 2.4.x 
none of this applies.

However if you are running 2.5.x then you should have a templates 
directory under you xiami directory. In that you will see a number of 
files which are GSL scripts that run when you do certain things such as 
try to look in a directory with no default html page (you can configure 
this at the bottom of the server config page in the wbe admin tool).

GSL scripts allow you to create anything you want practically for a 
directory listing and if you search back in the archives 
(http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/) for messages from me 
containing the word template then you will find a number that talk about 
soem things I have done to customise them.

Hope that helps

Francis

I have also found that the environment is rather useful when testing 
(e.g. paramters passed tend to be called FORM_XXXX so you can easily 
spot any typos) thus I tend to have the following at the top of my 
scripts (note that the environment is only printed out when the remote 
address is 127.0.0.1 I.e. localhost)

use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser set_message);
BEGIN {
  sub handle_errors {
    my $msg = shift;
    print "<h1>Script Error</h1> running".$ENV{'SCRIPT_NAME'}."<p><pre>";
    $msg =~ s/ (of )*\Q$0//g;
    print "$msg</pre><A HREF='mailto:XXXXX'>Email me this page</a>";
    return unless ($ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'} eq "127.0.0.1");
    print '<p><B>Environment Variables:</B><PRE>';
    foreach (sort keys %ENV) {
    print "$_: [$ENV{$_}]\n";
    }
    }
  set_message(\&handle_errors);
}

Yea. I have 2.4 so I will have to upgrade.  I think 2.5 is in beta but I am
sure it should be fine. (unless someone knows otherwise)

Thanks for the help.

If on NT, be sure that the account under which Xitami runs is accessable to you.
If you are using other programs, then too .. the account under which they run
must be accessable.
So .. for instance, if PHP Nuke has no permission to the Xitami ?? See what
I mean? This may be a permissions issue.
Hopefully this helps.

It means that the perl.exe wants to communicate on port 25.
If you want this, go to your firewall and set the permission.
If you don't want this, go to your firewall and deny and log any attempts.

Hello Ingo,

 While I'm not certain what you mean by "virtual servers", I am going
 to point you at the "virtual hosts" section of the help files in
 <Xitami Root>/webserver/xitami web pages.

 If I understand you correctly though, you are looking to install a
 server (web, mail, news or other) on a virtual host. This is not
 thoutoughly covered in the Xitami manuals, but you may get enough
 information to get you started from the Virtual Host section.
 Basically, you create a virtual host and a virtual cgi-bin directory
 in Xitami and then put your server in the cgi-bin directory.

 Hope this helps.

 Magus

Hi,

Usually this port is used for SMTP (sending mail). I think your perl engine
might try to interpret a script which tells it to send an email
automatically. How do people anyway send automated emails in Perl? I have no
idea.

Hope this helps

Thanks for that but I'm lost as to what to do. To get in requires user and
password and the instructions do call for chmod but I thought windows (98)
don't need this. I use Xitami simply on my computer to learn , so don't use
it on the internet. Any help (step by step) would be appreciated

Which Admin-- Xitami's or PHPnuke or PostNuke? If one of the latter,
then their docs "should" tell you what permissions are needed.

Xitami on Win9x doesn't have the file permissions issue. There might
be some way to make Xitami's Admin screen come up "access denied"...
bad password, password disabled, or badly corrupted configuration.

Subject: [Xitami] Limiting Connections Per IP
Message-ID: <F164vKhBxT18j7nqqKg00001006@hotmail.com>

I'm running Xitami 2.5b5 on WinXP.. Is there a way to limit the # of 
connections an IP address can make to the http server? I have some large 
files I'm serving but the Download Managers that use segmented downloads 
(Download Accelerator, GetRight etc.) take up all the connections I limited 
it to, denying others from reaching the site. I currently have it setup for 
15 max connections and several times I've seen a single person take up all 
15 by themselves when downloading the files, so I'd like to limit that to 1 
or 2 per IP so others can actually reach the site. I looked through the help 
files on the site and couldn't find a setting for it (Keep-Alive isn't it).

Thanks

I do not kow enough about PHP Nuke to give a good explanation.
Your description is an indication of a permissions issue.
It is quite possible that it could be something else.
Sorry I cannot provide more assistance.

Can you recomend a good wikiwiki program to use with xitami?

I'm just looking for some thing simple to run on my own machine.
I'm always downloading stuff then losing track of what this strange name file 
is.  I thought wikiwiki might be easy way to keep an index.

Any one have any better ideas?

I got this to work about 6 months ago... folks on this list suggested I do
the folloing to get it to work, and it does:

include this in your WML page... you're WML editor will probably do this by
default.
"Content-Type: text/vnd.wap.wml"

AND set your MIME to:

     Wbmp=image/vnd.wap.wbmp
     Wml=text/vnd.wap.wml
     Wmlc=application/vnd.wap.wmlc
     Wmls=text/vnd.wap.wmlscript

While I expect someone will mention this is getting off 
topic, macs.

But, that's not really what you're looking for... here's 
one that was in the back of the WML book I read:

1) Go to Ericsson's web site and join their developer group.

2) Download the FULL WAP/WML SDK (any one will do).

3) When you install, you will notice a Xitami WAP server app.

4) It was included to aid in testing of apps.

This is how I found out about Xitami in the first place. If they

no longer include it, I'm sure that I can find the "old" copy.


Here are a few links to editors(free):

http://www.wapdrive.com/DOCS/wap_software/waptor.html

http://www.inetis.com/santanabuilder.asp

There are quite a few out there, but the best ones come with

the SDK's(unless you pay (OracleMobile, etc.)).


Hope this helps,

W.R.Palaia

The original purpose was as a wml server, however with a little

creativity, the possibilities are limitless. Example: a portal

server:  the ability to access your customized applications through

personal computers and the full range of mobile devices -including

Palm, PocketPC, I-mode, WAP and other internet-enabled phones,

Blackberry, and even traditional voice phones.


One of our current projects applies this to satellite radio. But

then again, you don't have to use Xitami for this. The original

question was about serving wml.

Subject: [Xitami] Defining cgi programs
Message-ID: <3D762821.2040606@waitaki.otago.ac.nz>

Hello,

I've defined cgi-bin and installed my cgi script in a directory under 
it, and i can call it fine.

However, instead of passing the url 
http://myserver.co.nz/cgi-bin/myapp/script.cgi to people i'd like to 
pass a much nicer url http://myserver.co.nz/myapp/

Now i've figured out i can call the script index.html and place it in a 
directory under cgi-bin so that i just have the directory name in the 
URL and not need to specify the script filename in the url, but i can't 
figure out how to get rid of the cgi-bin part.

I've tried specifing aliases,
myapp = cgi-bin/myapp just gave 404,
myapp = <full path>/cgi-bin/myapp/ delivered the contents of the script 
instead of executing it (very bad!)

So, is there something i've missed or is there no way to do this in xitami?

TIA
dan.

The solution ended up testing the MTU setting on my connection. Using this

Lo and behold, it is now available for all to see.

Thanks for everyone's suggestions.

New information:

It works ok with www.k4hw.com but not k4hw.com. It used to work the same
with k4hw.com. Perhaps it is nothing to do with Xitami.

Francis,

I find no such file as httpdir.gsl or any directory such as
/xitami/templates on the system. Should I create these? If so What is the
syntax of the file entries?

Thanks

Hal

Beginner here! Running Win 2000 SP2.
I've set up a local Xitami web server, then installed Active Perl (both =
latest versions downloaded within the last week). During the Active Perl =
installation, I selected Xitami as the web server to automatically =
configure.
When I tried a simple Perl script:

#!F:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -wT

print "Content-type:text/html\n\n";
print "Show me the money! The Active PERL interpreter is working with my =
web server!";

the printed content shows up in my browser, leading me to believe that =
Perl is working. However, when I try to use a HTML page like:

<html>
<head>
 <title>Animal</title>
</head>
<body>
<form action=3D"animal.cgi" METHOD=3DPOST>
Which animal? <INPUT type=3D"text" name=3D"animal">
<P><INPUT type=3D"submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>

to pass a string to a CGI script like:

#!F:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -wT
use strict;
use CGI ':standard';

my $animal;
$animal =3D param('animal');

print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "Show me the $animal";

the result is a blank page.=20
When I view->source for the blank page, I get:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D"text/html; =
charset=3Dwindows-1252"></HEAD>
<BODY></BODY></HTML>

As stated, I'm new to all this and don't know what to try next.=20
I had a similar problem getting PHP to work which was solved by adding =
an entry to Xitami's Defaults.cfg file under the [mime] heading. Is =
there an entry I must add to get Perl/CGI scripts going as well?

Any help gratefully accepted!

Subject: [Xitami] FW: Crashes
Message-ID: <000901c2623a$25635fd0$6600a8c0@COWBOY>

Howdy All,

I'm getting the following errors in my Xitami crash log on one machine
in my basement which runs 24/7 unattended. 
The machine generates and stores log reports for a number of web sites
and Xitami is only used to view the reports. 
Therefore it may go for days without any calls to Xitami.

222mhz P2 dual processor which was running Win2k sr2 at the time of
first occurrence.

When the errors first began I was running version 2.5b5, so I backed up
to version 2.4d6 with the same results. The first several incidences
shown below repeated about 100 times a second for about 5 or 6 seconds
before it was shut down. This went on several times a day for about 2
weeks. Then I let the machine run without Xitami for a week or two. 
I believe sr3 was installed between the 1st and 2nd examples. At least
the machine now has sr3 on it. (automatic updates) The 2nd and 3rd
examples are more recent and were only repeated a few times before being
shut down. Sometimes, the internal Xitami system reports the bug and
shut itself down as I find the errors on screen. 
The silent recovery system does not recover.
Other times Windows kills the process with no Xitami error reported
either on screen or in the crash log. Any Ideas as to what is causing
this and what to do about it? 
I've run Xitami for years with no problems until about 2 months ago.
