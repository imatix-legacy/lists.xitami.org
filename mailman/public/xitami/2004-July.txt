Yes RO, XITAMI does support WAP and XML if you add the extension into MIME.
Here are a few sites that might help you, did me for my needs.
http://www.waptutor.org.uk/index.html

http://www.openwave.com/us/

I run on XITAMI 2.5b5 and here is my WAP page.
http://www.crewe-weather.d2g.com/wap.wml from my weather station and it
also servers XML. The problem that I am running into is that Verizon
(Openwave + LG4400) does not redirect to another port other than 80 but the
Nokia 7250I among others do register in my log. Guess port redirecting has
not caught up with VERIZON yet. (Can you hear me now?)

Hope this helps.

I have a website that I want be accessable by cell phones, pagers, etc - 
does Xitami support this functionality?  If so, how/where can I get started 
with docuementation?  If not, are there any third party tools I can use to 
integrate into Xitami?  Having never done this before, what things do I
need 
to be aware of in designing a website designed for wireless devices?

thanx for the assistance.

It's entitled unsubscribe as a hint to people who somehow got themselves
onto the mailing list and want to get off (the most common source of
administrative work).   For that reason I'm not inclined to change the
description.  

Adding an extra line try to to point out the archive location to people
for whom the "listinfo" in the URL isn't enough of a hint seems overkill.

Also every message sent to the list comes out with a List-Archive header
with exactly the right URL in it:

List-Archive: <http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/>

Might I suggest that you raise your eyes UPwards (not easy, I know, when
one is "blessed" with using
 X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 6.00.2800.1158
instead of a proper Mail User Agent).  If you look amongst all the
headers, on *every* post to this list, you will find:

 Reply-To: xitami@lists.xitami.org

<mailto:xitami-request@lists.xitami.org?subject=unsubscribe>
 List-Archive: <http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/>

Such information has traditionally been included in the headers of most
proper mailing lists for at least the 23 years I've been using them.
Proper MUAs make it easy for the user to see such pertinent information.

YMMV.

Message-ID: <003301c461b2$05bf42b0$0100a8c0@192.168.0.1>

Hello Group!

I am a new member of this group, and would like to say hello to everyone
right here; but I am using Xitami WebServer since the first release version,
and I really do like it. But I am having one big problem:

I am running Xitami WebServer version 2.5c1 on an Windows 2000 machine with
an ADSL-Connection (5MBit/s - ~1M/Bit/s). All was wonderful until
yesterday...I was at work and tried to connect to my server (located at
home) to download a PDF-Document. After r.a. 32KBytes Xitami stopped the
transfer and I got only a broken file. I tested around with other big files
and everytime I got the same problem. Then I tested my email-server and sent
these big files to my company email address and this worked fine.

So, I guess this problem is on Xitami and/or my configurations, which
mostely are all on default-settings. As I already said, the connection
itself is okay but Xitami stops sending datas above ~32KB.

If anyone has an idea how I can fix this problem, please help me.

So far, thank you very much, and...
....have a mice day :)

Do you have the same problem if you try to download the file form a local 
computer? (a second computer at home connected via LAN).
If this fails too, then the problem will probably be the server computer.
Xitami is known to have a weak ftp server: it's included, but don't rely on it.

Are you allowed to use your ADSL connection for running servers?
Here, most adsl connections don't have a fixed ip and well known server 
ports are blocked.
Did you try to use your webserver with an alternate port? (anything between 
10000 and 32000 is fine)

Just some ideas to begin with.

Hello Marc!

First of all, thank you very much for you quick reply on my message!

I tested to download (and even upload) files via LAN, on my notebook and on
my workstation. Everything is working fine via LAN, only connection via the
Internet is making problems. I tried to analyze the header- and request- log
files and they say error number 500 (internal error) and 408 (timeout) on
the tests with the files I got some problems to download them. As next I
created a silly big HTML-file (only to test) with a size of r.a. 5 MBytes
and tried to download it. When I download this file via DSL/Cable connection
it worked fine, but when I try to download this file via a Modem (56 KBit/S)
it will stop at 32 KByte. Okay, with DSL/Cable it work - BUT - when I try to
run a CGI on Xitami which produces a HTML-file with a size of r.a. 50 KB it
even will not work via DSL/Cable.

Hmm, you see...I really cannot reproduce this error so I can explain, but to
me it seems that this is on the CGI (see 500/408 errors). But the CGI
temporary out-files (*.cgi *.cgo) will be created successfully by Xitami, so
I really don't know where to locate the error.

My provider allows nealry all ports and there is no limit to transfer datas
from and to my server. The server port 80 is open, and running well when I
connect via Telnet and get the HTTP-headers.

Any ideas?

Subject: [Xitami] Tseting CGI on localhost
Message-ID: <20040706233622.IWAR26517.fed1rmmtao07.cox.net@JGDOFFICE>

I'm trying to test a Perl CGI program (form processor, POST) on localhost
(WinXP).  I'm experiencing a series of problems:

1)  When I invoke the pgm.pl from a form with
action="http://localhost/cgi/alwmsg.pl" it fails with a "Page not found"
error; however, if I type the same URL into a browser the program runs, but
(see problem 2)
2)  When the program executes, it seems to be simply executing under
Windows. Running the manual debugger, I see that none of the HTTP variables
are in ENV, and none of the form fields are passed in.

I've set up a CGI Alias called "localalw" and associated the exact directory
where the Perl script is.
 
I've also set two environmental variables to try to invoke the ActiveState
Komodo debugger instead of the default one:
 
PERL5LIB
c:\Program Files\ActiveState Komodo 2.5
PERLDB_OPTS
RemotePort=localhost:9011 PrintRet=0 
 
But this does not work; default (command line) debugger still gets invoked.

My Goal: When I invoke the Perl program from a HTML page form, I would like
the debugger (Komodo) to be invoked for the program, normal HTTP/CGI
environment variables to be set up for the program, and the output from the
program (an HTML page) returned in the browser.

Any idea why HTTP isn't handling my Perl script?
 
Thanks for any help.

sounds like you have 3 issues: xitami config issue, WinXP issue and Perl
script issue:

1.  is localhost aliased properly?  is 127.0.0.1 selected as an IP address
that xitami will run on?
2.  did you set up you cgi-bin root directory properly in defaults.cfg?
what is the root path for you cgi-bin files?
3.  did you alias .pl files, in WinXP, to your /perl/bin/perl program - or
where ever you installed perl to?

I've continued to work on this, and now have the Komodo debugger getting
invoked, but the execution location is in an IE temp internet files
directory, and still not getting the HTTP vars passed through.  Here's
answers to you questions:

1) This seems to be covered.  My HOSTS file (under Windows) shows 127.0.0.1
associated with localhost. Entering http://127.0.0.1/ in the browser address
line calls up the index.html file in the web server root directory, and
entering http://localhost/ there does the same.  
2) I use the GUI Xitami configuration utility.  Under the [CGI] section I
have the WORKDIR variable set to "-" which is supposed to cause the script
to run from the directory where the script resides. Sounds like the
DEFAULT.CFG approach is hard wired, but I'm willing to try it if you can
point me to some doc on it.
3) PL files are properly alliased, as I have no problem running
ActiveState's Komodo debugger in stand-alone mode. My PATH statement in the
environment is also set up properly.  It starts out with C\PERL\BIN, which
is what Xitami is supposed to discover and handle.

Bottom line: it seems that Ximeta is recognizing the script as just a file
(that it invoked the associated fil service on), and not a CGI script.  That
would explain the script running, but un the wrong location and WITHOUT any
of the HTTP environment passed in.  Do you think setting up DEFAULT.CFG will
solve that?

Thanks!

Subject: [Xitami] Tseting CGI on localhost
Message-ID: <BAY13-F94GJU7iG5puH0007b5a2@hotmail.com>

actually, it is the Xitami.cfg that is supposed to be hardwired and your not 
supposed to edit that.  In Xitami.cfg is a line pointing to your true config 
- default.cfg (or whatever name you want to change it to.).  The default.cfg 
should have all your baseline configs which should override the xitami.cfg 
configs.  If you edit the xitami.cfg and mess things up then you could 
potentially have to reinstall everything.  I have actually corrupted mine 
before b/c I kept toying with it - took me a week to figure out it was 
corrupted (it was the last thing I thought of why things weren't working).

What version of xitami are you using - I recall hearing some early XP 
versions of xitami that had CGI (and/or PHP) problems.  Maybe someone else 
can comment on this.

The cg-bin path offers two options - 1) /cgi-bin is the root path (or a 
variation of it), as in http://blah.com/cgi-bin/test.pl and 2) /cgi-bin can 
be anywhere in the URL as in, http://blah.com/site/cgi-bin/myscripts/test.pl 
- but the path, obviously, must exist.  Remember that webservers need to 
know where the CGI scripts reside - unlike PHP where they can be executed 
from anywhere.

The two MAIN cgi configure lines are:
Main CGI directory:  	cgi-bin
     * (or where ever you store them)
     * all your scripts must be in that directory or a sub-dir of that main 
directory
     * it is also wise to have that directory sit at the same level as your 
"webpages" root dir
CGI URLs start with:  /cgi-bin
     * As I do, this makes the full URL path to the cgi directory start with 
/cgi-bin
           * correct: http://blah.com/cgi-bin/test.pl
            * incorrect: http://blah.com/scripts/cgi-bin/test.pl
     * you can anchor it another spot, but why?  :-)

There is a sub-CGI configuration too, but don't confuse that with the root 
configuration
Working directory:  	'-'
     * '-' means use program directory, refer to main config
Match /cgi-bin anywhere in URL?
      * if selected this allows you to put cgi-bin anywhere in the URL path, 
but can be confusing at first
       * if not selected (recommended) this anchors all URLs to 
http://blah.com/cgi-bin/test.pl

g-luck.

In-Reply-To: <BAY13-F94GJU7iG5puH0007b5a2@hotmail.com>
Message-ID: <20040707191729.ZNJT17971.fed1rmmtao02.cox.net@JGDOFFICE>

I've made some progress.  Looked through the server logs, and discovered an
error relating to Xitami trying to resolve the script name.  The problem was
that the default install puts Xitami in a directory name containing spaces;
the internal routine that resolves the physical script name stopped at the
first space it found (in the middle of the web server directory name).  I
renamed the webserver directory name to remove spaces, and now I'm HTTPing
to my script.
However, debugging is now a problem.  If I have the -d directive in the
script, Xitami hangs and fails with HTTP error 503.  Not sure how to resolve
that, but at least I'm executing locally now.
BTW - I'm using v2.5c1, if that helps.

i am not aware of http servers allowing for native script debugging.  I 
believe there is an option in the configuration section for CGI that allows 
for CGI debugging.  But I have never used that option so I don't know what 
it will return.  but a -d in the script will hang the script at that 
instance of "-d" thus not completing the script.  the -d will allow the 
script, and executed at the CLI, will allow the user to step through the 
script on line at a time.  I don't believe http can interpret that process.

Thanks for those thoughts.  The Komodo debugger is supposed to be invokable
(even from a remote site) through a listening ports 9000/9011.  Guess I need
to drill down on how that really works;  I thot it would work from any web
server - even a local one.
Thanks again for taking the time to help!

i am not aware of http servers allowing for native script debugging.  I
believe there is an option in the configuration section for CGI that allows
for CGI debugging.  But I have never used that option so I don't know what
it will return.  but a -d in the script will hang the script at that
instance of "-d" thus not completing the script.  the -d will allow the
script, and executed at the CLI, will allow the user to step through the
script on line at a time.  I don't believe http can interpret that process.

probably means you all ready have something running on Port 80, another =
webserver by chance, apache/IIS???

either shut them down then re-run xitami OR go to the xitami.cfg file =
and change the port number from 80 to something else that won't be a =

I tried squirrelmail once a year or so back and it didn't work on Xitami
- it used a goofy nonstandard header format which apache supports, but
Xitami doesn't.  (In all fairness, Xitami supports the standard header
format, and squirrelmail used the wrong one).  I quit trying after that,
but there are hundreds of the things out there, so finding one shouldn't
be a problem.

I use 1st class mail server. www.1cis.com on my windows machine. Works
great! And althought it's not free it is free free to try out and is fully
functional but It just puts a tag at the bottom of the email saying that
it's a trial version of the software. If I remember correctly it's about $60
per server.

Although the report was posted on the 15th, we received it this morning, so=
=20
there is some chance that people have exploited this against Xitami servers=
=20
in the meantime.

The denial of service is this: a malformed header (without the ':') causes =
the=20
server to enter an endless loop.

This DOS affects all versions of Xitami.  For those building from source, t=
he=20
affected file is smthttpl.c, and the patch is in the function=20
http_parse_header:

char *
http_parse_header (HTTP_CONTEXT *p_http, char *header)
{
=2E..
    while (header && *header && *header !=3D '\r') {
	...
        }
++        else
++           break;
    }
    return (header);
}

We are in the process of releasing new binaries, which will be on Xitami.co=
m=20
in a very short while.

Peter, I believe that is the date the DoS was discovered not the day it 
was posted. I just received the report here also.

It would be nice if people would contact the vendors first before public 
disclosure. Alas, this isn't a perfect world though.

Will you be updating the 2.4d10 series with SSL also?

New packages are now online at xitami.com, with this small patch and some 
other small changes in the 2.5 package.  There is also a new download for the 
2.4d11 SSL binaries.

I downloade the 1.5MB (xitami.com) to do the upgrade and the zip file does
not want to open, I get an error. It says "Cannot open: it does not appear
to be a valid archive."  I've tried it twice.

Hi Ron,

I just did a download of the installer package (1.5MB, xitami.com) and I had no problems to open 
the zip file.
I can sent you mine, if you like.

Does the patch require a full reinstall? Or is it simply just a patch to the 
existing install?

As well, I am running 2.4d9, am I required to upgrade to 2.4d11 for the 
patch because I didn't see a patch for the version I am running?

Public disclosure of security holes and bugs seem to be the only way Xitami
gets updated around here as all of mine that I've discovered have not been
fixed.  As tempting as it is to tell the world about them (and hence get
them fixed), I'll just keep my mouth shut to be courteous to the authors.

Message-ID: <715379D39F6E534594B4B3182B636590084831AE@fangorn.cc.vt.edu>

We applied the xitami pro patch to our 2.4d10 server (upgrading it to
version 2.4d11). In our defaults config file we have always had
enabled=3D0 in the lrwp section and everything's worked appropriately
(i.e. nothing listening on port 81).
However after applying the patch it appears xiprosrv will accept
connections on port 81 and it appears that lrwp is enabled now?
Has anyone else experienced this or know why it's happened?

Thanks!

Hello Xitami Forum,   :) :)

I am a newbie at Web stuff and Xitami. I am trying to come up to speed with all the new stuff (compilers; APIs; WEB Pages; Web servers and CGI; etc.).

I understand the DOS script code below using the nc.exe and have it running on my LAN from a client to the Xitami Server. 

The code below runs as expected and a Browser can continue to use the Xitami Server.
So, since I am new to Xitami, Web Pages, Headers, etc. it appears I need to understand how the MALFORMED HEADER defined below is created in the code below?????


Results of running the test code below:

The test code was executed with the following:
 
             test www.gsc.com 80

For testing, the www.gsc.com is maintained locally in the hosts file and points to the IP address of the Xitami server. And, the above execution of the test sends back the contents of the web page defined for www.gsc.com.

Even if the actual IP address of the Xitami Server is used it sends back error messages:

           403 forbidden       
           You are not authorized to access this reasource

And, the Xitami Server can continue to be accessed by a Browser.


I took a stab at modifying the line: echo HOST: %1>>http.tmp and removed the : from HOST:
But, Xitami sent back the error: 

           403 forbidden       
           You are not authorized to access this reasource

And, Xitami continues to work from a Browser as expected.


Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!! :) :)

Jerry

Subject: [Xitami] Pipedef and throttling problems
Message-ID: <WorldClient-F200407261338.AA38200000@nishodan.org>

Hi all,

Running v2.5c2 on Win2K Server...

The problems:

1.  Using the GUI to select a pipe use doesn't stick.  If it's
set for 256k, for example, and I change it to 512k and hit save I
can go right back in and see that it's still 256k.  I thought I
might have to wait for the 60 second refresh for this to show up
differently, so after waiting for 90 sec I checked and it was
still set to 256k.  I can edit the defaults.cfg file directly to
select 512k and after the refresh it will show up in the GUI.  It
doesn't seem to have any effect though...see problem 2.

2.  Selecting a pipe (actually, editing the defaults.cfg file by
hand due to problem 1) does not seem to have any effect on how
much bandwidth is used.  I've set the pipe all the way down to
32k and a max of 16 connections and I still see 200+ k
utilization by Xitami on the ethernet interface.  Did I miss
something?  It's not 32k PER CONNECTION is it?

Thanks for any help

-Lance

I have now tried to build 2 versions of Xitami from source.  (2.4d11 and
2.5c1).  Neither of them build.

Does anyone know when there will be versions of Xitami available that do
in fact build by following the instructions?

I have a script that seems to build xitami on Linux OK.  I just tested
it with the current version of xitami (2.5c2, with the recent DOS fix)
on Slackware 9 and it builds without errors or warnings.

The script is at http://eep.burdell.org/xibuild.sh

HTH ... let me know if there are any problems with it.

Hello All,  :) :)

Several web pages were discovered, one of which came from the IETF Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Working Group.

If I understand HTTP HEADERs correctly as an example a widely used HTTP HEADER is:

        GET /a_web_page.html HTTP/1.1
        Host: AwebSITE.com  (or IP address)
        Referer: LASTwebSITE.com


So, the line of code below that copies the string DOS to the http.tmp file should cause the DOS.

And, with Xitami V2.5b4 (bw3225b4.exe) the DOS does not occure.


Have I done something wrong or can V2.5b4 avoid the DOS???? I did not downloaded the source code for the V2.5b4 version.

Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!!  :) :)

Jerry

I'm having some trouble configuring Xitami and don't know enough to know
where my problem lies.  My domain was previously hosted at Doteasy.com. =
and
the domain name is still parked there.  I have given Doteasy forwarding
instructions to forward my domain: www.markcotton.com to my static IP
address: 216.31.21.30.  However, the only way I could get this to work =
was
to tell Doteasy to forward to http://216.31.21.30/markcotton/index.html
If I tell Doteasy to forward to http://216.31.21.30/ my Xitami is =
displayed.
I'm assuming this is because Xitami can't figure out what to display.  I
deleted the index and default files from the Xitami directory.  The =
config
file stored in the Xitami directory contains the following:
=20
#*END
=20
[Accesslog]
    Filename =3D "markcotton.log"
=20
[Security]
    Filename =3D "markcotton.aut"
=20
[Server]
    Webpages =3D "c:/xitami/markcotton"
=20
[Wsx]
    Admin =3D ""

I realize I could probably move the index page up into the Xitami =
directory,
but I'd like to host another domain once I get this one working like I =
want
to.  Can someone point me in the right direction?

  Hey all,

  I'm sure this is a dumb question for most of you, but for some reason I'm 
having problems getting my Xitami server to start "by itself" whenever I 
restart, or boot to Windows..  I am currently changing over from an Windows 
98SE, to an XP machine, and basically followed the same steps etc.  By the 
way, I've noticed that this may not be the ONLY problem that I encounter 
concerning Xitami on XP, so "ANY" help, suggestions, or advice about my 
doing this would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you, and have a good day!  /

Hello Tom,

I'm not familiar with XP, I run NT4, but as far as I have seen/heard XP has the ability to run 
services compared to 98SE. If you are working with the installer package, you have actually 2 
options to start xitami automatically
a: put the file xitamigui32 in the autostart folder; with user logon it should start automatically
b: install xitami as a service with the file xisrv32
for b: do the following
    1.copy the file xicpl32 to the Windows sytem directory
    2. open a dos box
    3. enter the following command after the prompt : xisrv.exe -i <enter>
    you should get a message which said that the xitami service is installed
    4. define the start options of the service in start > settings > service

That should be it. I hope you get xitami started.

Johannes

  Thanks Johannes,

  I knew that it was a simple thing to do, and have viewed it many times, 
but of course, as is with lots of things for me, "only when I needed it 
myself" was it an issue!  I think I've got it all working now and I 
appreciate your help!!  If you or anyone else has any other tips or tricks 
that might help me to farmiliarize myself with Xitami on XP  I sure 
appreicate any and all! Thanks again and have a good day all!
