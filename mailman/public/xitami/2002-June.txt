memtrace.lst contains a listing of "memory that was allocated but not
freed" when Xitami is exiting for some reason (normally or in a crash)
-- typically it should either not exist at all, or if there's a small
memory leak it should be a small (say 10KB) file.

If it is being written as a very big file then that generally indicates
that the list of "memory allocated" has a cycle in it, which in turn
indicates that something very bad has gone wrong.  Possibly the code
should try to detect this cycle, and avoid going round and round in
circles, but with a large list that can be a bit tricky.

You can safely remove the memtrace.lst file unless you're trying to
debug what went wrong.

Which are the bits of the HTTP header that Xitami supplies by default.
The header files that you're trying to use are for the HTTP header (eg,
expiry dates, etc), rather than for including text in (eg) the HTML
page.

If you want to include text in a HTML page then look at SSI (server side
includes) or PHP or similar.

It wouldn't be _too_ difficult to write something like that (a few days
work I suspect), but AFAIK no one has written anything like that so far.
Making it have the same interface as mod_perl (for Apache) would be
useful, but fairly complicated, as mod_perl is hooked into Apache at a
very low level.

There are some examples of LRWP integration with Perl, Python, etc, in
the Xitami addons directory, however they all require changes to the
scripts.  (The Perl interface at least could be better encapsulated as a
Perl module if anyone felt like doing that.)

Xitami doesn't support listening on multiple ports at once
unfortunately.  The closest that I can think of for what you want to do
is to use a web proxy in reverse-proxy mode in front of Xitami to filter
out the URLs you don't want to allow in; or just to rely on Xitami's
address checking feature in the .aut files, and ensure your firewall
allows that source address only to come from the internal machines.

I'm not sure what might be causing this, as I'm not sure what changed in
the handling of aliases between the two versions.  Generally it's best
not to include spaces in your paths/directory names anyway as they cause
all sorts of weird problems.

The webserver (eg, Xitami) never sees the relative path (eg ../images/x.jpg)
only the version of the path after the web browser (Mozilla, IE, Opera, etc)
has calculated what URL to request.  In your situation it sounds like
the paths being generated by the web browser are not matching what you
expect -- the relative URLs need to be based on the _webbrowser's_ view
of the website, not anything that the server knows about where to find
particular paths.

As a side note, you may get on better if you use absolute paths (eg,
/images/x.jpg) which sidestep this whole problem, and are also more
likely to be cached and reused reliably when used from multiple
directories.

You may also wish to use the Xitami [Server] debug=1 option to enable
the debug.log file, and check the exact requests Xitami is receiving,
and where it looks for the files.

Hello All,

Win2kPro with no problems.

I need to implement SSL on one of the sites I

Yes.  This is actually the only version available (the Xitami Pro based
on the latest stable Xitami).  Someone who uses it regularly is probably
better to comment on stability/performance/etc.

Subject: [Xitami] Missing requests.
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020603133318.0226fec8@posta.tuke.sk>

Hello.
I have problem with server.
When the server get several https requests in very short time,
some of them "disapear". I can not find any evidence of them
in Xitami logs even if I know that they was sent.

Configuration:
Xitami Pro
2 x Pentium II 800 MHz
512 MB RAM
Windows NT 4.0 SP 6a
also running Ingres 2.0 (database)
and some service processes.

Problem is worser when there is more load on the server.

Missing requests are from server which runs "Smokeping" utility,
which checks availability of the servers on the net by sendig 5 requests
(usualy pings) each 5 minutes. We use plugin which sends https requests
instead of  pings to check webserver health.
Ping request have score 5/5 (sent/recieved)
Https is usualy 5/1 during working hours and 5/2-3 during the night.

Question is:
How to decide who is responsible (Xitami vs. Windows).
Has  somebody any fix or tweak?
                                 Thanks.
                                         Zdenko Rohac.
P.S.
Our Smokeping is down by now (network is under reconstruction).

Hi,

I've been running Xitami Pro, 2.4d10 for 4 months. It works well 
except a few minor issues. So I would say it is stable.
The problems are
	- initially there is no logs directory, you'll have to create it 
yourself; Xitami tells you this in the console log or if you run it as 
console mode which I recommend during the site certificate setup
	- setting up the certificates it's a bit tricky, I think there is a 
problem with a path in the configuration file; in the SSL section of 
sslhttp.cfs which contains these entries
    
    [Ssl]
        cert-key=key.pem   
        cert-file=cert.pem 
        ca-cert-path=certs 
        ca-cert-file=thawteca.pem

I've had to specify the path like this, it seemed that ca-cert-path 
entry is not working

 [Ssl]
        cert-key=key.pem   
        cert-file=certs\cert.pem 
        ca-cert-path=certs 
        ca-cert-file=thawteca.pem

	- generating certificates with extended validity, ex. 1 year 
requires that you get the documentation for ssleay, actually there 
is a parameter called -days that needs to be changed
	- it the begining I've had a problem with the log files not being 
renamed (permission denied); I've had to play with the logs 
configurations, basically I've just change them and now it is working
	- the documentation (i.e. the html help files) is outdated (from 
2.4d7)
	- once you get/generate your certificates (1024 bit keys) and 
make the ssl work, the encription is seamless for you, as far as 
CGI or lrwp programming, are concerned; however, the whole 
transfers are slowed down the speed probably depends on your 
machine as well as users' machines
	- all in all, it seems that although Xitami Pro I have is the 
version 2.4d10, its configuration and other files have somewhat not 
been fully updated

Please note that the website that I am running is only for research and is not receiving a lot of hits.

Hi Dave,

I'm replying not as an expert but as a user which is a useful perspective
too. I have been experimenting with different servers and have certainly
found them to have some obvious strengths and weaknesses from the end user's
perspective.

I like Xitami in that it runs efficiently and is very easy to configure. You
can also come here for support issues. In all my wanderings I have yet to
find a server with as straightforward a configuration as this one. It will
get the most out of your hardware which is a bonus too.

Apache is an industry standard and has a huge number of contributers. You
can download prebuilt modules which extend the basic functionality of the
server as well. You have to do your research to configure this one but there
is a lot of info and examples out there. Functionality is excellent.

Pi3web is a newer server which is gaining in popularity and supports all
kinds of popular technologies, but again, configuration is not so
straightforward as Xitami and there is much less documentation than Apache.

Java based web servers are gaining in both popularity and usefulness. That
has been surprising to me as java is not the most hardware-efficient
language, but benchmarks and personal experience have attested that there
are useful products out there. Generally the java based servers are set up
to use servlets or java server pages or else serve static content but there
is now work underway to support other scripting languages like PHP and Perl.

Jigsaw server is a case study for the World Wide Web Consortium
(http://www.w3.org/Jigsaw) and has support for servlets and also for filters
like PHP (although I've had trouble connecting to a database through PHP
with this server). You can also set it up to work with a Java Server Pages
engine. The standard in java based servers right now though is Tomcat
(http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat) which was originally largely just a
servlet engine for apache but has become a stronger stand-alone server in
version 4 and comes with built in support for java server pages (using the
Jasper engine). Jetty is another server worth looking at
(http://jetty.mortbay.org) as it is built specifically to run as a
stand-alone server and has some load-balancing features built into it. Jo is
another popular java server (http://www.tagtraum.com) which comes with good
documentation. These servers are great for java applications but are not as
popular yet for general purposes although they are showing promise.

Hopefully you'll get some help from those with more experience but I thought
I'd put in my two cents in case it can help as a springboard.

You should also consider the frequency in which nev versions come available
of those servers. Regretfully development of Xitami has almost come to an
end. This will become more and more a disadvantage compared to the other
open source webservers.

I found a really good idea for those of you who use CGIs (haven't tried it,
but it might help ease the DoS/DDoS issue with CGIs).  Put them in a RAM
drive as well as the location of the filters (pipe????.flt).  Obviously,

Xitami is by far the better of the two web servers feature-wise (Savant is
pretty (GUI-wise), but has some serious limitations - e.g. no VHosts).  I'm
currently making comparison charts of various servers in case anyone is
wondering why I'm looking at a different web server.  I don't plan on

Some of you may have read abut the woksdome hack. Those of you that use 
PHP may like to read about it to see if you are vulnerable too as the 
hack looks like a classic "forgot to remove some default PHP stuff that 
is a security risk".

I'm not sure how this would work in a Xitami/PHP setup (as I don't use 
PHP) but it looks like ti should also apply

Can you do that on Windows?  In DOS I had a program called RAMDISK that 
was great but it Windows wouldn't let use it anymore.

EzMTS.  <http://www.ezmts.org/>

>2) How well does the cold fusion express work from shining light prod?

ColdFusion Express is a product of (former) Allaire Corp.  Allaire sold out
to Macromedia Corp. (the people who produce Flash) a little while back.
Macromedia promptly raised the price-tag of ColdFusion by $1,000+ with very
few changes to the product.

>I am on a cold fusion enterprise server now.  What should I expect to
>lose if I transfer?

Since ColdFusion doesn't normally work with Xitami, I wrote a wrapper
program that runs as a filter CGI (XiFusion) to the CFML executable.  This
will cause a performance decrease in initialization time of the scripting
engine.  Other than that, you shouldn't lose a thing.

>3) I imagine that if I just download MySql and PHP that I can install it

You have to set up Xitami, but that is a one-line configuration issue.

You seem to be stuck on scripting engines and not necessarily understanding
the separation of the web server from CGIs.  Xitami runs all scripting
engines as CGI applications.  As with any web server, you will get
different mileage with different scripting engines.

Hope this helps!

Well 'many' here _my_ answers to your questions:

Q1) Any free e-mail servers? Any with web based admin?
A1) Any mail server will work as long they don't try to use the same ports as your webserver.  Rarely is that issue.  If your talking about mail server having a web interface then either interface has to work on another port of have a standard CGI that the webserver can use.
N1) If you want check out the main server at PMAIL.com.  Freeware and solid.

Q2) How well does the cold fusion express work from shining light prod? I am on a cold fusion enterprise server now.  What should I expect to lose if I transfer?
A2) Cold Fushion does not directly work with Xitami.  However there is freeware program called XiFushion that is extremely easy to install and will work with any Win32 version of Cold Fushion (Express thru Enterprise).  
If you use Enterprise with xitami the you shouldn't loose anything.  If your switching Express you loose the following: Speed(MacroMedia purposely slows down Express), compatability(some functions are disabled), plug-ins/external binaries(again disabled to get you to buy the full version)

Q3) I imagine that if I just download MySql and PHP that I can install it right and expect it to run on Xitami?
A3) You just download and install MySQl and your set.  No webserver directly integrates to MySQL.  If you download PHP with the installer you will have the option to install PHP into Xitami.
N3) Note: You can use XiFushion with PHP and get slightly better performance.

Q4) What is Python anyway?  They also make a Free Windows port.  http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/
A4) It another scripting language like PHP, Cold Fushion, ASP, and Miva.  
N4) Personally it's not my fav but again thats personal programming preference.

Q5) How does Sun Chili!Soft ASP compare against INstantASP Xitami?  MSRP is $495 http://www.chiliasp.com/chiliasp/default.asp?target=windows
A5) Chilli Soft's ASP is a solid product.  It does work on PC's with Xitami but you need to have a Java Servlet engine running on your system.  Setup is nowhere near as user friendly as any of the other languages mentioned.  Plus you can't use ActivX DLL's or OCX's on a *nix system without WINE, and even that is buggy.  If your married to ASP then your stuck with IIS.

Try IA EMail server from TNSoft.com Free for 30 days. Works well.

Any more ... I don't think you can just download and install and expect anything to run without some configurations.
Python is a programming language.

Win95 and 98 allow some sort of ramdrive through config.sys.  There is a
way to get WinMe to do it as well (force it to load config.sys on boot).
There is a program called RamDiskNT by a company called Cenatek out there
that will do the trick for NT/2000 (don't know about XP), but it costs
money.  So, those are probably your options unless you want to play with
device drivers...

Win95/98/Me - search Google.com
WinNT/2000 - pay money (I think the most expensive I've seen is $4,000+ for
ram drive software...that's rediculous).

Hope this helps!

TNSoft.com if you are going to pay $600 for an unlimted user license you

You might want to go to http://download.cnet.com and search for
"ramdisk".
I used to use a commercial Ramdisk-software on a NT-Workstation called
"Superdisk"
(now SuperSpeed), see http://www.eecsys.com. The price depends on size
of
memory and processortype (it was about $180 for a PII-450 with 512 MB).
You can
define a whole partition (say half as big as your physical memory) 
as a ramdisk, which will be loaded into RAM a boottime.
A lazy write-through mechanism reflects all filechanges to the
harddrive.
I put the whole website onto this partition, including the Perl and
REXX-Interpreter.

But you should bare in mind, that often used files will be held in the 
system-filecache by Windows itself, so you probably won't need a ramdisk
at all

Greetings
Axel

Too much memory for Win NT/2000 is not always good.
Windows uses the L2 cache as index table to access memory. If the L2 cache 
is too small in comparison with the available memory, the index table will 
be put in main memory.
Windows states that you need roughly 1kb of L2 cache for 1Mb of RAM.
The L2 cache is a extra memory faster than normal memory. L1 cache is the 
internal cache of the processor.
Check your program manager <CNTRL><ALT><DEL> to look how much memory is in 
use. If you need virtual memory, buy some more memory, but don't do it if 
all of your available memory is not in use on a normal load.

Hi "Many",

I tried MRTG several months ago. It worked just fine on my Windows 95
system. I just looked at their web site and they still have a Windows
version available.

http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/

Speaking of monitoring web traffic, I've been looking for some monitoring
program that will show me the web page addressess of what my users are
browsing. I have not been able to find anything like that, that will run on
a Windows computer. Anyone out there know of anything that will help me
monitor my users?

Thanks,
Kelly

Thanks WRPalaia for the information, but I believe this only shows which web page

Anything out there like that?

This is coming well after the subject was introduced but Melle gave me a
good idea for using PHP with Xitami and I found a way to automate it.

The problem I was having was when the data a php file was changing, if the
php file itself was not modified the browser would not request a "fresh"
copy and would still see the old info. But there's an easy work around in
the php.ini file.

There's a section that looks like this:

 auto_prepend_file =
 auto_append_file =

where any file you specify can be tacked onto every page. So I put this:

<?php

// this is a prepend which doesn't allow the browser to cache PHP content

header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");
header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);

header("Pragma:no-cache"); // for http 1.0 browsers

?>

into a file called "prepend.php" and changed the php.ini to

auto_prepend_file = prepend.php


now I get the fresh info every call. Thanks to everyone who helped me on
this one.

After installing the server I was initially able to run a test script

pop a box asking me if I wish to open the file or save the file to
disk.  I've tried reinstalling the server, but to no avail.

do I get a directory listing of the CDROM in my webserver?  I've got the
"downloads" folder under "webpages" showing the listing just fine, but
can't figure out how to display the CDROM.  Any ideas?  I'm running
Xitami 2.5 under Win98 on ADSL, with Perl, PHP, and mySQL.
 
thx, Mark

Go into the web-based admin screen, click Configuration, and then click
Aliases. Enter the directory that you want to point to the CD-RROM
directory in the Alias section and the CD-ROM directory in the Points to

I don't think there are any logs for programs freezing, but I may be wrong. You can try looking at the access logs and seeing if it
was overloaded or if it happened when a certain part of your web site was accessed.

I am hoping somebody with a bit more knowledge than I have could help me =
past this stumbling block.

We are building an e-commerce site and I am using Xitami Pro v2.4d10 (c) =
on Windows 95. Xitami was very easy for a total beginner to install and =
get running. The system operates properly except now I am trying to =
install CA Certificates from Thawte to provide SSL encrytion. The bulk =
of the html pages are stored on our ISP's servers, and cgi-scripts =
retrieve the shopping cart pages from our local server, which is tied =
into our point of sale software here. Connection is made through DSL =
with a Cisco 675, and we run ZoneAlarm firewall protection.

I believe I have done everything right in terms of paths, placement of =
certificates, etc. But the SSL layer is never getting connected, I =
believe as a result of the error message below from the xitami log file. =
I hate to admit this, but I am in way over my head here!

2/06/07 15:24:47: smtssl: preparing for connections on port 443
2/06/07 15:24:47: smtssl: ready for SSL connections on port 443

2/06/07 15:56:09: smtftpc: error on socket 148: WSAENOTCONN

I am guessing this is a Winsocket error message, but I lack the smarts =

Go into the web-based admin screen, click Configuration, and then click

Then click Save, and Restart.

I'm _really_ new to Xitami, so this may have been answered before: how do I

Sean:

There could be several problems here:

1.  Many cable modem ISP's block the ports below 1024, at which point 
the typical SSL port (443) would be blocked also.  Therefore, you need 
to redirect to a different port.  It is easy!  First you need to change your 
typical port number in the SSL control file (sslhttp.cfs).  The port 
number variable is under the first section labeled [Server].  CHange it to 
anything you would like (for example, 2443).  From now on, instead of 
sending ssl requests to https://www.southbroadwaytropicals.com, you 
would send the requests to https://southbroadwaytropicals.com:2443.

2.  If you want to know for sure that port 443 is blocked, go to 
www.tzo.com and download their app, Port Detective.  It will run through 
all the typical ports and tell you which ones are blocked.

3.  Finally, check the final line of the sslhttp.cfs file, in the section 
labeled [Virtual_hosts].  You must give it the IP addy of your 
connection.  The instructions actually read that you must use actual IP 
addresses; though, I have used domain names (since we have a 
dynamic IP), and have found that it works for us.... though, I have no 
guarantees for anyone else.

Hope this helps.

As I stated in a previous email that all you need to do is setup your own
name server with a FreeBSD box or any other OS that will handle a NameServer
  Then you need at least two static IP addresses to Bind to the ns1 and ns2.
 This is the reason why outsourcing is so popular for the way to go as most
people cannot get a static IP block and then most people cannot setup a
Linux box.  It can be achieved under NT/2000/XP but then again, who would
take the chance with sub standard software such as M$ products.

To some extent, yes.  Servers always listen for incoming connection
requests on the well-known port 21.  Servers will also accept incoming
data channel connections on well-known port 20.  However, FTP servers
[normally] *send* data out from some arbitrary port (as determined by the
next available socket for the create_socket primitive) to a specific data
port on the client.

Chris Olsen had already written earlier in the thread as follows:

 As always, for any server administrator, whether you run a single "hobby"
 server on your cable modem, or manage a WAN, a review of the appropriate
 RFC's would be in order to make sure that you understand what you are doing,
 and are doing it properly.  In this case, you would want to refer to RFC1579
 and RFC959.

It's advice that you, and anyone else concerned about "how FTP works"
would do well to heed.  I know that some RFCs can be particularly
difficult for the novice to understand (e.g. the one on Van Jacobson
header compression, or that on STAC data compression), but the "basic"
RFCs on "basic" protocols (such as SMTP, FTP, etc) are really not too
difficult at all.  Please DO go and read those RFCs; after all, these are
the standards that make the whole of the Internet work (despite the
attempts of Microsoft to undermine them by adding non-compliant
extensions to all and sundry).

Anyway, the fundamental position with "traditional" FTP is that the
client, upon the user asking to "PUT <somefile>" will issue the command
"STOR <filename>" to the server over the command channel (which goes from
some arbitrary port number on the client to port 21 on the server).
Assuming that the server is happy with this (the client, as
authenticated, is permitted to write into the current directory, etc),
the server will then listen on its default data connection port (20) for
the content of the file, which it will store away.  The essence of the
connection is that the client pushes the file to the server.

For transactions taking place in the opposite direction, Jon Postel and
the rest elected to follow the same model: the end with the file pushes
it to the end that's getting it.  To do this, the server needs to push
the file to the client.  Since client systems don't usually listen for
connections (unlike servers), the server needs to know to which port to
send the file (remember that for many client systems with multiple users
the "ordinary" unprivileged user may not create privileged ports, which
usually means those below 1024).  The client program is expected to
create a port on which to receive the data connection, and this will
usually be arbitrary at the whim of the client's operating system.
Therefore the PORT command is used to tell the server the correct port to
which to send the file: it specifies the 32-bit IP address and the 16-bit
port number, and the server then creates a socket connecting to that port
to send the file.

Now this works perfectly whilst the client and server are directly
connected; however, if there's an intervening firewall, or perhaps a
router that performs NAT (Network Address Translation), then the
protocols break down.  The NAT process, for instance, will not be capable
of changing the content of the PORT command to reflect the port number on
the firewall to which the server should send traffic nor even the IP
address of that machine; neither will it be able to forward that traffic
to the port number on the client computer originally specified in the
command (except with a proper ftp-proxy process running on the firewall).

Therefore the PASV command is available, which is sent to the server, and
causes it to listen for the client to initiate a data connection to a
port on the server.  The port to be used appears in the server's response
to the PASV command.  The process at the client end for storing the
retrieved file away then takes data from a socket which has *initiated*
the connection, and therefore there will be no problems with NAT or
firewalls.

One caveat: it might prove impossible to establish a data channel
connection when both client and server are behind non-proxying firewalls.

YMMV.

66.172.2.44    PTR    www.kdralumni.com

66.172.2.44    PTR    www.carpe-dm.com
66.172.2.44    PTR    www.ripandburn.com

The script I am running for the auto email comes from the =

Once I deleted the PTR record for kdraumni.com then the email header =

www.swellegantvintage.com machine.  Is there another way of doing this =
or tricking the email server so no matter which site generates the form =
and subsequent email that it reflects the correct DNS name (site name) =
that it came from?

Hi Mark,

Guess it depends on version ... i have been using it for years now.....
got
a copy of it when it was free during their development and had no
problems
making it work.

Have used it on several sites without problems ... perhaps if you cant
get
your version to work you should drop me a line and get a copy of the one
i
have ?

Hi people,

i didnt realise i had posted to the list until i recieved a message saying
my post had been held up.

Andrew had asked about mailman and i had offered to send him my old copy of
it to try. so when he asked i assumed it was a direct e-mail rather than a
list e-mail.

Andrew please contact me directly for this garry@cable.net.nz

Hi all,

I am just about to write a C++ wrapper for the LRWP C library and before 
re-inventing the wheel, I'd like to know if anyone has already done this? A 
quick Google search revealed that there's no such thing out there but I 
figured I'd ask here anyways ;-) I'll gladly post the code of the wrapper to 
this list when it's done.

Regards,
Fabien.

Hi Russell,

Your message intrigues me. I run Xitami Pro and host about 6 sites, 4 of
them my own. I am on a DSL line and the company I have it through will not
let me have any more. Mabry I am wet behind the ears ( I am when it comes to
computers) but are you having several different domaine names on the same IP
addresses? If I am wrong. please let me know, and If you are, will you tell
me how it is done? but in plain language.

  Subject: [Xitami] DNS and VHosting




  I am hosting about 10 different domains via DNS virtual hosting.

  All my sites work properly.  However, several of the sites send
auto-emails from forms and so forth.  When the email comes in, the Header
info shows the email coming from a different web server.

  Is there anyway to get the header info, using Xitami or DNS, that can get
the correct DNS name.

  Example:
  in-addr.arpa file:
  66.172.2.44    PTR    www.kdralumni.com
  66.172.2.44    PTR    www.swellegantvintage.com
  66.172.2.44    PTR    www.carpe-dm.com
  66.172.2.44    PTR    www.ripandburn.com

  The script I am running for the auto email comes from the www.carpe-dm.com
site, however, the email header shows the site that connected to the mail
server was: www.kdralumni.com .   Technically, you are only supposed to have
one PTR record for an IP address (in this case, it was using the first one
in the list), you can have many A records though.

  Once I deleted the PTR record for kdraumni.com then the email header
showed the connecting machine as the next one in the list:
www.swellegantvintage.com machine.  Is there another way of doing this or
tricking the email server so no matter which site generates the form and
subsequent email that it reflects the correct DNS name (site name) that it
came from?

  -Thanx in advance.

Subject: [Xitami] Error log shows hacking attempts?

Message-ID: <3.0.5.32.20020611005709.0408fc38@vvm.com>

Hello all...I am pretty new to Xitami, but I am fairly sure that the
following log would indicate an attempt to hack my system. Anyone want to
confirm this for sure? Any suggestions on prevention? I can also assume
that at least one of these commands would be the reason why I am
occasionally coming home to find my Xitami with an internal error that
requires a restart?

Thanks!

Mike

I am hosting about 10 different domains via DNS virtual hosting.

All my sites work properly.  However, several of the sites send =
auto-emails from forms and so forth.  When the email comes in, the =
Header info shows the email coming from a different web server.

Is there anyway to get the header info, using Xitami or DNS, that can =
get the correct DNS name. =20

Example:
in-addr.arpa file:=20
66.172.2.44    PTR    www.kdralumni.com
66.172.2.44    PTR    www.swellegantvintage.com
66.172.2.44    PTR    www.carpe-dm.com
66.172.2.44    PTR    www.ripandburn.com

The script I am running for the auto email comes from the =
www.carpe-dm.com site, however, the email header shows the site that =
connected to the mail server was: www.kdralumni.com .   Technically, you =
are only supposed to have one PTR record for an IP address (in this =
case, it was using the first one in the list), you can have many A =
records though.

Once I deleted the PTR record for kdraumni.com then the email header =
showed the connecting machine as the next one in the list: =
www.swellegantvintage.com machine.  Is there another way of doing this =
or tricking the email server so no matter which site generates the form =
and subsequent email that it reflects the correct DNS name (site name) =
that it came from?

-Thanx in advance.

Shoot me dead if this has already been solved.

Xitami seems to have a hard time rotating the access logs.

Xitami should be copying the current access.log file to yesterdays

date 'ac0x0x0x.log' type of thing, but sometimes it skips days,

and the access.log file just gets bigger and bigger... then it finally =
does it.

I am thinking that when my server is busy, and it is suppose to actually =
rotate

the log file, it can't because the server is being hit, and it is =
writing to the file,

access denied type of thing.


I even gave up having Xitami do it, and wrote a perl script to do the =
rotating for me, but

Xitami won't let go of the access.log file, and I can't delete it to =
start

fresh after I copy the file.

Any ideas on how to get Xitami to perform this seemingly simple task???  =

hhhhmmmm, well I was expecting to get help on my issue - not give help =
on my issue.  But oh well.  Basically I collocate my server at an ISP.  =
My server has 4 IP addresses:=20

.42 =3D Primary Server address, Primary DNS address
.43 =3D All domains use this address as the email server
.44 =3D All domains use this address as the web address
.45 =3D All domains use this address as the FTP address

Because I host my own DNS I can add as many domains as I want.  My =
provider simply does secondary DNS.  Each domain only has 3 address: www =
(.44), ftp (.45), mail (.43).  My suggestion to you is to host your own =
DNS and have your ISP host secondary - that way you can host as many =
domains as you need.  You probably only get 1 IP address via your DSL =
line - but you can still setup everything I listed above on the same IP =
address (I just happen to have 4 IP addresses, so I decided to use them =
all)

When hosting your own DNS - remember that each IP address can only have =
ONE reverse (PTR) record - that is IP to DNS name.  But you can assign =
as many names to an IP address, aka, a forward (A) record.

Example:, assuming domain1 is the primary domain of the server
Forward Zone:

So, your provider allows you to host 6 domains, the above will allow at =

    Subject: [Xitami] DNS and VHosting




    I am hosting about 10 different domains via DNS virtual hosting.

    All my sites work properly.  However, several of the sites send =
auto-emails from forms and so forth.  When the email comes in, the =
Header info shows the email coming from a different web server.

    Is there anyway to get the header info, using Xitami or DNS, that =
can get the correct DNS name. =20
    =20
    Example:
    in-addr.arpa file:=20
    66.172.2.44    PTR    www.kdralumni.com
    66.172.2.44    PTR    www.swellegantvintage.com
    66.172.2.44    PTR    www.carpe-dm.com
    66.172.2.44    PTR    www.ripandburn.com

    The script I am running for the auto email comes from the =
www.carpe-dm.com site, however, the email header shows the site that =
connected to the mail server was: www.kdralumni.com .   Technically, you =
are only supposed to have one PTR record for an IP address (in this =
case, it was using the first one in the list), you can have many A =
records though.

    Once I deleted the PTR record for kdraumni.com then the email header =
showed the connecting machine as the next one in the list: =
www.swellegantvintage.com machine.  Is there another way of doing this =
or tricking the email server so no matter which site generates the form =
and subsequent email that it reflects the correct DNS name (site name) =
that it came from?

    -Thanx in advance.

usually, it's computers on the wan side infected with viruses like sircam.
get used to it, you'll see many, many such hits in your log.

i don't know much about iis exploit-related worms, since i don't use windows,
but they're certainly out there.  try searching for some of the more
distinctive strings in google and you'll get piles of information.

this is called "virtual hosting".  most webhosting companies that offer a
"lite" option (or big hosts like earthlink or yahoo) do this to save IP
addresses (which aren't really necessary for webhosting, anyway).  the trick
is to have a webserver that will parse the domain name you enter and server
up pages from a corresponding directory.  xitami does support virtual
domains, although i haven't had to use this feature yet.  you configure the
virtual domain in the admin web interface and it'll serve as many virtual
domains as you like on different ports (try to use ports numbers greater than
1024 - i would start with port 8080, but that's just me...)


the catch is that people won't be able use your IP address in their browsers,
because you'll have multiple domains on there (maybe it would default to the
page being served on port 80, but i've seen pages just hang) - 

nslookup foo.com

Name:    foo.com
Address:  207.229.128.68

nslookup bar.com

Name:    bar.com

Most other servers I have seen (UNIX and WIN) running Virtual Hosting or
names based hosting will default to a particular webpage when the IP
address is entered.

Probably not, unless you run your own mailserver and play tricks
with it. Most mailservers will expect their name to match DNS
records.

If you can hack the script, you can get SERVER_URL from the CGI
environment and put it into the SUBject or body of the message, so
the reader knows where it came from.

Unless you host websites for resellers and are doing a favor for your
resellers so their customers can't find you as easily... It makes them
happy. We also have a generic SSL for our server keeps them happy too...

This is an attempt to exploit a bug in MS IIS webserver. The syntax
is incorrect and should be refused (and Xitami refuses it without
any problem). In unpatched IIS, it runs the NT-DOS command-line
processor and allows arbitrary commands to be run. "dir" is an
innocent command, but if they get a response to that you may expect
a hacker to come back and try something malicious.

However, network owners are now doing scans like this. Today my
bosses are throwing a few dozen such "hack attacks" against all
machines on campus, and will notify owners if they see trouble. So
it may be your "friends at the ISP" rather than hackers.

> GET /default.ida?NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN......

This is CodeRed or Nimda. These send a very-long request. A proper
piece of software will either take the whole thing or truncate it
and refuse it. In unpatched MS IIS, the gibberish at the end
overflows data space into code space, overwrites part of the
program, and infects it with the virus (that gibberish is Intel CPU
machine code). This attack is very specific to IIS: the same code
injected into any other software would not do what was planned, and
generally causes lockup or crash. In Xitami, the buffer does not
overflow and it simply logs the request and the fact that it didn't
make sense.

> with an internal error that requires a restart?

No. As long as you have enough disk space for all the crap that
piles up in logs these days, Xitami is not bothered by any of the
crack-attacks shown in your logs. Say what version of Xitami (please
do NOT say "latest version"!!!) and what Windows or other O/S you
run it on.

Hi all,

I am new to this list, so forgive me if this question has been answered 
already.

Does anyone know when Xitami 2.5 will be released for production?

Also, is there an archive for this list somewhere?

hhhmmm, I do run my own DNS and Email server.  The FROM address reflects the
correct address of the server, its just that the header info does not.
Example:

        www.ripandburn.com -> generates Email and connects to Emal Server
        Header Info of Incomeing Email:
                www.carpe-dm.com connects to mail server: mail.carpe-dm.com
                ...
                From: auto-email@ripandburn.com
                To: user@blah.com
               ......

I want it to to say:  www.ripandburn.com connects to mail server:
mail.ripandburn.com

Where does SERVER_URL exist at, which script?  I just want the encoded mail
exchange/header info to match the FROM address.  Its a small detail but it
is so much cleaner and that way each of my doamins would have the ability to
look like a complete, independent entity.  Most users will never know, but I
am a stickler for details.

Thanx

  I am hosting about 10 different domains via DNS virtual hosting.

  All my sites work properly.  However, several of the sites send =
auto-emails from forms and so forth.  When the email comes in, the =
Header info shows the email coming from a different web server.

  Is there anyway to get the header info, using Xitami or DNS, that can =
get the correct DNS name. =20
  =20
  Example:
  in-addr.arpa file:=20
  66.172.2.44    PTR    www.kdralumni.com
  66.172.2.44    PTR    www.swellegantvintage.com
  66.172.2.44    PTR    www.carpe-dm.com
  66.172.2.44    PTR    www.ripandburn.com

  The script I am running for the auto email comes from the =
www.carpe-dm.com site, however, the email header shows the site that =
connected to the mail server was: www.kdralumni.com .   Technically, you =
are only supposed to have one PTR record for an IP address (in this =
case, it was using the first one in the list), you can have many A =
records though.

  Once I deleted the PTR record for kdraumni.com then the email header =
showed the connecting machine as the next one in the list: =
www.swellegantvintage.com machine.  Is there another way of doing this =
or tricking the email server so no matter which site generates the form =
and subsequent email that it reflects the correct DNS name (site name) =
that it came from?

  -Thanx in advance.

Thank you, but everything is set correctly.

Does everyone else's log files work perfectly?

Doesn't anyone else have this problem?

  Shoot me dead if this has already been solved.

  Xitami seems to have a hard time rotating the access logs.

  Xitami should be copying the current access.log file to yesterdays

  date 'ac0x0x0x.log' type of thing, but sometimes it skips days,

  and the access.log file just gets bigger and bigger... then it finally =
does it.

  I am thinking that when my server is busy, and it is suppose to =
actually rotate

  the log file, it can't because the server is being hit, and it is =
writing to the file,

  access denied type of thing.


  I even gave up having Xitami do it, and wrote a perl script to do the =
rotating for me, but

  Xitami won't let go of the access.log file, and I can't delete it to =
start

  fresh after I copy the file.

  Any ideas on how to get Xitami to perform this seemingly simple =
task??? =20

  Reliably?=20

Hi,

I am using Xitami Pro 2.4d10 on NT4.0.
I've had some problems with the log files not being 
renamed (permission denied), so they were no rotated at all; I had 
to play with the logs configurations, basically I've just changed 
them and now it is working fine. I understand that this is not 
*exactly* your problem since rotation works to some extent. 

My take on this was that the configuration files for the Pro version 
were "inherited" from 2.4d7 (whose help files were in the 
distribution package) hence not updated in some sections (e.g. 
there was no log directory entry, maybe other things). Playing with 
the web admin tool might have put the missing entries back in, I 
guess..

Please note that the website that I am running is only for research 
and is not receiving a lot of hits.

No one knows when (or even if) 2.5 will be released for production.  The
internal iMatix version has changes which might even justify a higher
version number, so there might not be a 2.5 release, but it's not clear 
when/if that internal version will be released.

>Also, is there an archive for this list somewhere?

There's a link from:

http://lists.xitami.org/mailman/listinfo/xitami

to the archives for the last 12 months or so.

MessageI am running NT4.0, it has a built in DNS Server, otherwise you =

upgrading to Win2000 Server, it too, has a built in DNS Server.

When using the Configure VHost Option off the main menu - two of the =
first options off the first screen are:
    Select IP address: All Addresses (recommended)    //////// <- Use =
this option
    OR, Enter DNS Host Name: __www.domain1.com______  //////<-- type in =
the full DNS name of the machine

Then in your DNS server:
1. Create the Primary Zone for domain1.com
2. Add a forward (A) record only for the above name:
        www.domain1.com     A    192.168.10.10  /////( or whatever the =
IP address of your machine is)

    ///// Be careful it doesn't auto create the PTR record, most DNS =
programs off the ability NOT to create the PTR record, but by default it =
will.
3.  Contact your ISP and let them know you are adding a new primary =
Domain and they will need to pull secondary records from your Primary =
DNS server.

Can't be any more specific than that....
good luck.

    Subject: Re: [Xitami] DNS and VHosting


    hhhhmmmm, well I was expecting to get help on my issue - not give =
help on my issue.  But oh well.  Basically I collocate my server at an =
ISP.  My server has 4 IP addresses:=20
    =20
    .42 =3D Primary Server address, Primary DNS address
    .43 =3D All domains use this address as the email server
    .44 =3D All domains use this address as the web address
    .45 =3D All domains use this address as the FTP address

    Because I host my own DNS I can add as many domains as I want.  My =
provider simply does secondary DNS.  Each domain only has 3 address: www =
(.44), ftp (.45), mail (.43).  My suggestion to you is to host your own =
DNS and have your ISP host secondary - that way you can host as many =
domains as you need.  You probably only get 1 IP address via your DSL =
line - but you can still setup everything I listed above on the same IP =
address (I just happen to have 4 IP addresses, so I decided to use them =
all)

    When hosting your own DNS - remember that each IP address can only =
have ONE reverse (PTR) record - that is IP to DNS name.  But you can =
assign as many names to an IP address, aka, a forward (A) record.

    Example:, assuming domain1 is the primary domain of the server
    Forward Zone:
        www.domain1.com    A    192.168.10.10
        www.domain2.com    A    192.168.10.10
        www.domain3.com    A    192.168.10.10
        ...
        ...
        www.domain100.com    A    192.168.10.10

    Reverse Zone:
        192.168.10.10    PTR    www.domain1.com


    If you are unable to host your own DNS then I recommend you view the =
previous postings with subject line: DNS
    <snip> Quoting Greg Hart:
    DNS
    >>For DNS, try zoneedit.com, which is free for the first 5 domains, =
or try the Dynamic DNS service list from=20
    >> http://directupdate.net/links.html You can also search for 'free =
DNS' on the internet.
    >>-Greg

    <snip>

    So, your provider allows you to host 6 domains, the above will allow =
at least 5 more. =20

    NOW, if someone could answer my question I would be pleased as =
punch.

        Subject: [Xitami] DNS and VHosting




        I am hosting about 10 different domains via DNS virtual hosting.

        All my sites work properly.  However, several of the sites send =
auto-emails from forms and so forth.  When the email comes in, the =
Header info shows the email coming from a different web server.

        Is there anyway to get the header info, using Xitami or DNS, =
that can get the correct DNS name. =20
        =20
        Example:
        in-addr.arpa file:=20
        66.172.2.44    PTR    www.kdralumni.com
        66.172.2.44    PTR    www.swellegantvintage.com
        66.172.2.44    PTR    www.carpe-dm.com
        66.172.2.44    PTR    www.ripandburn.com

        The script I am running for the auto email comes from the =
www.carpe-dm.com site, however, the email header shows the site that =
connected to the mail server was: www.kdralumni.com .   Technically, you =
are only supposed to have one PTR record for an IP address (in this =
case, it was using the first one in the list), you can have many A =
records though.

        Once I deleted the PTR record for kdraumni.com then the email =
header showed the connecting machine as the next one in the list: =
www.swellegantvintage.com machine.  Is there another way of doing this =
or tricking the email server so no matter which site generates the form =
and subsequent email that it reflects the correct DNS name (site name) =
that it came from?

        -Thanx in advance.

    Shoot me dead if this has already been solved.

    Xitami seems to have a hard time rotating the access logs.

    Xitami should be copying the current access.log file to yesterdays

    date 'ac0x0x0x.log' type of thing, but sometimes it skips days,

    and the access.log file just gets bigger and bigger... then it =
finally does it.

    I am thinking that when my server is busy, and it is suppose to =
actually rotate

    the log file, it can't because the server is being hit, and it is =
writing to the file,

    access denied type of thing.


    I even gave up having Xitami do it, and wrote a perl script to do =
the rotating for me, but

    Xitami won't let go of the access.log file, and I can't delete it to =
start

    fresh after I copy the file.

    Any ideas on how to get Xitami to perform this seemingly simple =
task??? =20

    Reliably?=20

We have been very busy.  Running a business has meant putting 
resources where they make the money that pays the rent, and since 
1999 this has meant slowing down work and support for Xitami.

We have occasionally considered ending the Xitami project, since it 
is expensive, hard work, and tends to burn-out the people who work on 
it.  However, we always come back to the same conclusion: it is a 
great project, important to us, and we will not abandon our users.

So, I can state for the record that as long as iMatix exists, we will 
continue the Xitami open source project.  We continue to work on the 
source code, especially the SMT kernel on which Xitami is based, and 
we are almost finished with a new packaging tool that will allow us 
to make new releases more easily than has been the case for the last 
few years.  We plan a 2.5 final release, and then a new 3.0 alpha 
release.

However, I can't make any statement about when and how such new 
releases will come.  This all depends on how much money and effort we 
can shift into Xitami, and the motivation of the people who work on 
it.

As a developer of both free and commercial software I do feel a need to add my
comments to Pieter's excellent response to a rather controversial issue.

Open source software is a GOOD thing. However, it does come at a cost. That
cost is laid upon the developers of the package involved. We do the best we
can trying to balance the scales. Economics play a large part in the decisions
that are made. Our investment means money, for those inclined to do so in an
open source world the investment is time. In a commercial world, time IS
money.

I guess in short what I am trying to say is this... Don't be so critical of
Imatix in their release schedule. If you are so inclined to criticize their
efforts, put yourself in their shoes and see what it takes to produce a
product that is as reliable as Xitami is. It is NOT easy.

What it all boils down to is this.. The source code is available, if you don't
like what is currently offered, take the time to learn it, make the changes
and submit them to the Xitami team. They WILL listen. What you will gain is a
bit of fame, what the rest of us will gain is a product that exceeds the
expectations of even the Xitami team.

After all, that is what open source is all about..

My goodness.

Could people finally learn how to quote, and
especially, learn what NOT to quote? Also know not to
post in HTML-format?

More often than not, people forget to delete all the
quoted-rubbish and it really really really makes this
mailinglist hard to read, especially the digest.

Quoting in a way that readers keep interest is not
-that- hard, is it?

I would really like an automated moderator installed
for this mailinglist. Ewen is that possible?

I'd like a magical device that knows exactly what I'm thinking and then
goes and does it for me.  Of course, that would take all the fun out of
programming and life, now wouldn't it?  :)

Thanks Pieter for explaining this.

Basicly I think the webserver is just doing a fine
job. At least the win32 version is very stable, the
GUI-taskbar-thing was not that good because of the
memory-leaks:-(

I run Xitami with PHP on a Windows98 machine and its
simpy doing the job. The PHP-pages could be a bit
faster but that has nothing to do with the web-server;
I could install apc-php-cache if I really need the
speed...

The only thing I think could use some improvement is
the tool to do the settings of the server.

That is, the web-based admin-system is good, but
looking at the messages in this mailinglist, it could
be a bit better especially for how to setup vhosts
etcetera? I guess more and more people are getting
used to GUI's for doing their settings instead of
editting INI files?

The other thing is the rotating of log-files, which
indeed is not always going as expected (that is, it
will skip rotation now and then). I guess the locking
of the log-files when a visitor is on the site indeed
has something to do with it, my server is experiencing
the same problems.

I hope this helps where to focus for the most 'needed'
improvements.

Greetings from the Netherlands and thumbs up!

	And also keep the original message subject, as it is very useful. Some people
subscribe to a digest version of the list, and reply to individual messages
without copying/pasting their subjects, they keep the original digest subject
line, which is pretty useless to the rest of us. They may be replying to a "PHP
in Xitami" message but their subject line will say "Xitami digest, Vol 1 #394 -
2 msgs".

Indeed, useful comments, thanks.  We plan to rewrite the web-based 
configuration tool, using a more general approach based on XML 
configuration files.  We are starting to use this approach in our 
internal products.

It looks like we have solved one of the big problems with log 
cycling, namely that it occasionally fails, and we will put this fix 
into the 2.5 release as soon as we can.

We have spent some time rewriting the core and improving other parts 
of the SMT kernel on which Xitami is based.  This should make it more 
stable.  We are also increasing the use of GSL as a scripting 
language inside the server, but that has to be done carefully since 
it opens potential security holes.  But GSL is the main reason why 
we're talking about a 3.0 release instead of a 2.6 release.

Xitami is not an isolated product.  It is based on a technical 
platform that we (iMatix) use very heavily for our internal products 
and a couple of commercial ones (like STEP).  This means that while 
the specific web/ftp functionality of Xitami will probably not get 
much richer until we (iMatix again) find we can base commercial work 
on Xitami, the internals will continue to get more robust and more 
interesting over time.

Finally, I'd like to thank everyone on this list, and the many other 
people who use Xitami, for their patience.  Xitami is as much a 
reflection of the people who use it as it is of the people who wrote 
it.

I still do it the old fashioned way.  Actually, back when Xitami v2.4 (not
v2.4d9) was around I attempted to use the web-based admin and none of my
settings stayed, so I got used to editing the config files by hand and
manually restarting the server...much easier and actually worked.

Although, I must admit, I spoil myself and build web-based front-ends to
everything.  I've even been tempted to build a web-based compiler for
remote compilation of programs.  I hate jumping through hoops to VNC into a
machine to compile a program.  I just don't have the time to build that
system (yet - but coming fairly soon).

If you are increasing and improving the use of GSL could you also 
increase and improve the doumentation or GSL?.

I like it a lot as a stand alone program as well as a part of Xitmi - 
but the documentaion is less than stellar. For example I cannot figure 
out how to create/access new XML nodes with .new and the function 
capability - especially WRT to recursion - is less that clear.

yea - me too. everyone always talks about the gui.... but i couldn't get
vhosts to work using it. much easier/quicker to add some quick lines to the
config file.

 for people that need vhosts, all you do is add this.... then create the
"extranet.cfg" and "intranet.cfg" file..... using your own names of
course....

[Virtual-hosts]
    extranet.mydomain.com=extranet.cfg
    intranet.mydomain.com=intranet.cfg

I am sorry if I offend anyone by saying this but...why another scripting

really great and well documented that I ask myself why not embedded one of 
them in Xitami (my personal preference would Python ;-).

What makes GSL so special vs say...Python?

As far as I am concerned that would save you a great deal of time and money 
and make effective use of Open Source software.

I'd prefer perl if you're offering :)

> What makes GSL so special vs say...Python? 

Its a native XML aware language. And it has no overhead to deal with non 
XML things. Basically its extremely good at taking a template and 
applying it to well structured data and completely crap at everything 
else. But since about 90% of what I want to use Xitami for is taking 
structured static data and displaying it prettily as HTML its perfect 
for my needs. I use perl to do the more dynamic bits but even if I were 
to use Apahe+mod_perl+LWP+XML parsing I doubt I could get as fast a 
rendering of static data on the same (relatively low end) hardware.

I believe GSL is open source.

The thing is that I think GSL could be used better by me. But since I 
can't fgure out how to do a coupe of things it isn't.

You don't even need to go to tht extent for Win98.  Take your recovery
disk (whadayamean, you haven't got one: go and make one NOW:-) and look
at the config.sys and autoexec.bat thereon.  There's more programs
(FDISK, FORMAT, etc) required on such a disk than there is room for on
one floppy, so Microsoft nowadays compress the content on the disk, and
create a RAM disk during the boot sequence into which the compressed
images are expanded.  So the diskette contains (uncompressed) the
requisite drivers for a RAMdrive.

OK, I solved the problem.

I wrote a Perl script that kills the Xitami server process, which frees =
up the access.log file,

rotates the access log file, then restarts the machine.

I wanted to restart the machine, so that the Xitami server had a fresh =
start for the day,

so any leaks or problems would never get a foot hold.

Works great, and unless something else happens, I am assured consistent =
rotation of=20

my log files.  If you use this script, make sure to set up Xitami to =
stop rotating its logs,

just set it up as manual, so it just keeps loggin forever to access.log.

Quite obviously this is for Windows only, and for Window 2000 only, =
since I do not believe

that the iteration and termination of system processes works right under =
other Window OSs.

This script also assumes that you keep your logs in c:\xitami\logs.

But if you don't just read the script and change it, its not rocket =
science.

P.S.-You might want to comment out the InitiateSystemShutdown function =
when you first

test it, just to make sure everything is cool, and you are not surprised =
by a system shutdown.


Here is my script, hope it can help someone:

    Shoot me dead if this has already been solved.

    Xitami seems to have a hard time rotating the access logs.

    Xitami should be copying the current access.log file to yesterdays

    date 'ac0x0x0x.log' type of thing, but sometimes it skips days,

    and the access.log file just gets bigger and bigger... then it =
finally does it.

    I am thinking that when my server is busy, and it is suppose to =
actually rotate

    the log file, it can't because the server is being hit, and it is =
writing to the file,

    access denied type of thing.


    I even gave up having Xitami do it, and wrote a perl script to do =
the rotating for me, but

    Xitami won't let go of the access.log file, and I can't delete it to =
start

    fresh after I copy the file.

    Any ideas on how to get Xitami to perform this seemingly simple =
task??? =20

    Reliably?=20

    Using Xitami Pro v2.4d10

I do not have the locked log issues since I do not rotate the logs, but I 
would like to point out that my Xitami webserver machine has uptimes of 
over 200 days. I do not like randomly rebooting 'just to make sure', 
especially when it is not necesarry. 

Oh yeah, running on OS/2 of course :-)

Regards,

Joachim

Runs under XP home just fine.  I've been running it on my XP home box (AMD
1.0GHz w/ 256MB ram) for the past 7-8 months without problem.  I can't
really tell that Xitami is running when using my box heavily.  I am hosting
my site on this machine and am using SSI and Perl (ActivePerl).

Xitami should be a really good choice for your purposes.  FYI, I have also
been able to get ColdFusion running with Xitami.  I would suggest going with
version 2.5b5 as it has the SSI processor built in and with 2.4d9 the SSI
processor is a Perl script (which isn't as fast).  The only draw-back to
2.5b5 that you should be aware of is there is a bug with virtual hosts that
cause them to not work correctly (see the list archives from April to June
for more on this).  Also, some required files are not in the .exe install
package, so you'll have to download the .zip source kit to get those).  A
little bit of work to get it working, but after it's up and running there
really isn't too much that needs to be done.  Plus the web admin is a
heckuva lot nicer than any other freeware web servers out there (I've tried
several others before landing on Xitami and have actually been using Xitami
on-and-off for the past 4-5 years).

Good luck

Subject: [Xitami] problems with symlinks and other small things
Message-ID: <0003a361919b9ee6_mailit@smtp.cistron.nl>

Hi all,
I am running xitami now for severall months on BeOS and i must say it works 
wonderfull stable and reliable.

Just a few things i ran into with Xitami.

1) Aliases won't work good with scripts(PHP)
As I was browsing through the old list messages it seems that it is known,
Any fix for that besides setting up virtual hosts? i haven't tried that yet 
but might do that just the same if there is no alternative.

2) A straight symlink(folderbrowsing) that is capitalized partly won't go any 
further and replies with the message that it can't find that page/url. If I 
change it all to small letters it's fine (not the symlink they are presented 
with a First capitol letter too even if small letters are used.
How can i change or avoid that behaviour within the server, i am not that 
fond to change all downloads and folders for example systemwide to small 
letters.
I tried the setting for unsafe names like in windows recommended. didn't work 
out.

3) When a dot is in the url and folderbrowsing is on, the page genaration 
displays the asci code for the "." for example, any possable solution for 
this to solve that? Or is it just the gsl scripting that's behaving like 
that?

For all the remaining i haven't encountered a full userfriendlier web/ftp 
server as Xitami,
great job and like to thank Imatix for the good work.

Grts,
Ted.

I run Xitami on a pitifull Win98 box (P166, 96 megs ram, 2 gig HD), and I
reboot it every 75 days "just to make sure." If you're running NT, 2000, or
XP, I'd say rebooting every day is a little bit of overkill.

It actually hurts the machine to reboot it every day when running any
Windows OS.  The reason is due to registry keys being created and deleted
every time the OS loads.  The problem is that the registry functions never
truly delete keys (they just clear a bit).  So, every time you boot up, the
machine gets progressively slower because it has to look through that many
extra registry keys (whatever the number is).

Note that the machine itself is not hurt, just the amount of extra time
that is spent skipping dead spaces in the registry hunting for keys.  There
are registry optimization programs out there, but I only used one once and
had to reinstall Windows shortly thereafter.  My solution after that was to
just leave the machine on.

Hope this helps!

Message-ID: <001e01c213fe$d197c280$6401a8c0@rdemarti>

I'm currently using dns2go to route my dynamic ip into a single domain name
(i.e. the IP address changes but the domain name insures the site is found).
Currently I cannot get Xitami to work. I can see the site on my local system
but the outside world cannot get in. I was hoping someone else had a similar
circumstance and could offer a solution.

Right now I'm using a program called, "TheServer" and it works fine, but
lacks any type of server depth. The interesting part is that server lets
traffic in no problem... so I know it's possible it's just probably a
setting I am overlooking.

Thanks,

Yup.  (char *), (int *), (void *), (struct
MyReallyExtraSillyLargeNameForAStruct *)

Sorry, I've had a rough day and figured I would share it with you.

I would recommend XiFusion, except I have the only version of that sitting
on my computer that will do what you want (XiFusion v2.6).  However, I'm
not sharing it with anyone until I get SSL capabilities on my website
(Everybody say "Hi" to Craig, the web-host guy :) (Please, don't e-mail
him, he's got enough problems from me <chuckles to self>).  That's only
part of the reason, but the other reason is that I need to get my hands on
a Linux box for 2 minutes to compile and test it there.

The problem with most applications written for PHP is that they are not
written for PHP as a CGI, but rather PHP as a module (specifically as an
Apache module).  When PHP is run as a CGI, it acts differently enough to
cause problems such as the ones you are having (I've noticed that
re-direction is a major problem with PHP under Xitami).  XiFusion v2.5 does
some re-direction handling, but it won't always work and even fails in some
cases.  XiFusion v2.6 deals with every re-direction issue that has risen in
the past but is somewhat slower because the approach to re-direction has
changed.

Hope this helps!

I use dns2go and xitami.  Most residential ISPs block port 80, so no one
outside your local ISP "hub" of computers can access your domain on a
standard HTTP port.

If you can connect to your domain using your domain name locally, then your
domain provider points to Deerfield's servers, so thats all fine.  But if
you can't get in from "outside", you need to set your portbase to a value of
like 5920 to get Xitami to work on port 6000 (5920+80) (or whatever works
with your ISP - might take some experimentation).

In the dns2go client, you need to goto the service settings tab, and on the
"apply the following settings when I am:" pull-down, select online.

Then check the box next to "Redirect web requests (with a www prefix)"

then check the radio button that says "To my current IP address on port" and
then  put in your portbase value + 80 (6000 as shown above).  If you need to
know how to get your FTP port back down to 20, read the defaults.cfg file
carefully.  It works similar to portbase - just use a negative number to
bring it back down.

Restart Xitami

Disconnect then reconnect the dns2go client.

Now everyone should hopefully be able to connect to your ISP using
www.yourdomain.com.  But, remember that the www. is now crucial in order for
dns2go to know to portforward the HTTP request.  http://yourdomain.com will
result in an attempt to connect at port 80, so it will not work.

Hope that helps.  You'll need to do a little more if you still need Xitami's
FTP services.  Maybe not -  FTP might work fine at port 5940 on your ISP.

P.S. For FTP, use ftp://yourdomain.com  not ftp://www.yourdomain.com or
dns2go will try and portforward the FTP request.

Good Luck,

- Jay Aldrich

Thanks Jay! I'm completely impressed with your detailed explanation of how
to handle this. I'm very grateful and am keeping this around for the
future...

Here's the kicker. I knew port 80 wasn't blocked from my ISP (however I know
several people who are having the port 80 problems and now I can help them
out), so I went to try this anyway hoping for the best. I noticed in my
settings that there were two NIC cards listed. For some reason my system
inherited settings from a previous system's when changing over the hard
drive. I simply deleted the unused NIC card and voila! server came right up.

I must have looked at my network settings a million times, which explains
why I kept looking over it.

Thanks again for focusing me in a different direction that eventually shed
the light on my own stupidity.

Yay!  I'm glad it works.  Sometimes XiFusion works, other times it fails
due to the nature of the 'header("Location: ...")' tag.

>It seems to be bullet proof... I haven't gone and tested every nook and
>crannie of nuke yet but so far so good...

Just don't share PHPNuke with the world at this point.  Xitami can only
handle about 60 simultaneous users with XiFusion v2.5 (Windows version)
before strange things start happening (e.g. 0-1 bytes returned contained in
the Xitami logs).  XiFusion v2.6 doubles that number (handles about 120
simultaneous users before Xitami panics).  This problem was discovered
during a distributed attack test on one of my machines (I was attempting to
test to see how robust the various scripting languages are under rigorous
conditions).  This is a known DoS/DDoS issue with Xitami.

If you don't expect that type of consistent load, then there is nothing to
worry about unless someone has the intent of bringing the server down.  At
that point, you would have to start blocking IP addresses/blocks.

Other than that little note, I am glad that you got PHPNuke to work using
XiFusion v2.5.

Hope this helps!

For the most part, there's little difference between Home and Pro edition,
very little.

I run pickmy.org entirely on a WinXP machine (Pro), only problem I have is I
can't get BlorpScript to work, if anyone has gotten BlorpScript to work
creating thumbnails automatically.

Someone may have already answered this...I'm a bit
behind on my mail.

Anyway, using your log examples:
This is an example of a Nimda infected server trying
to  contact and infect another server (MS)...Xitami is
not vulnerable to this.

24.197.171.236 - - [07/Jun/2002:06:17:55 -0600] "GET
 /scripts/root.exe?/c+dir HTTP/1.0" 404 0 "" ""

Next in line-
24.80.126.251 - - [10/Jun/2002:18:53:34 -0600] "GET
/default.ida?NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNN

This is the signature of a Redcode, or is it Codered
infected server reaching out to touch someone...again
Xitami is not affected by it.

The one I'd be concerned about is this one-
63.124.119.130 - - [10/Jun/2002:15:04:22 -0600] "GET
/cgi-bin/testcgi
HTTP/1.1" 404 0 "http://budogeeks.tzo.com/"
"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; 
MSIE

I would want to know why someone is looking for
testcgi on the system! At least they got a 404 <LOL>

Actually, the best bet is to run any unusual lines in
the search engines , minus the url's, and see what
comes up. Also, runa search in the engines of Xitami
exploits and see what you find...then correct it on
your system.

Hope that helped.

Eric

I searched for Xitami exploits and http://www.securiteam.com/ had quite a few of them. They were all for Xitami 2.4 or 2.5, but the
beta versions varried. If you're interested, I'd recommend checking it out.

Someone may have already answered this...I'm a bit
behind on my mail.

Anyway, using your log examples:
This is an example of a Nimda infected server trying
to  contact and infect another server (MS)...Xitami is
not vulnerable to this.

24.197.171.236 - - [07/Jun/2002:06:17:55 -0600] "GET
 /scripts/root.exe?/c+dir HTTP/1.0" 404 0 "" ""

Next in line-
24.80.126.251 - - [10/Jun/2002:18:53:34 -0600] "GET
/default.ida?NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNN

This is the signature of a Redcode, or is it Codered
infected server reaching out to touch someone...again
Xitami is not affected by it.

The one I'd be concerned about is this one-
63.124.119.130 - - [10/Jun/2002:15:04:22 -0600] "GET
/cgi-bin/testcgi
HTTP/1.1" 404 0 "http://budogeeks.tzo.com/"
"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;
MSIE

I would want to know why someone is looking for
testcgi on the system! At least they got a 404 <LOL>

Actually, the best bet is to run any unusual lines in
the search engines , minus the url's, and see what
comes up. Also, runa search in the engines of Xitami
exploits and see what you find...then correct it on
your system.

Hope that helped.

Eric

Hello Xitami gurus...

Having used SSI since its inception I'm struggling to make it work with my
Xitami server.

When I write an SSI command such as <!--#include virtual="page.shtml"--> the
server returns nothing in the page. As if the command never existed. Upon
checking the source, there is nothing there where the command should be.
Strange indeed. I don't even receive an SSI error in the page or in the
logs.

I have SSI enabled in the admin setup. I have .ssi, .shtm, .shtml extensions
enabled.


Any ideas???

Thanks again,
Rob

Should I improve my configuration? Using version 2.4d9.

Robert,

It would appear that you would need to direct the include to the proper
directory. Even though include file=file.file should work, it needs to know
the directory it is in, if it is not located off of the root.

Please review your SSI protocol before writing to the Xitami group.

-Robert

Matthew,

Thanks for reporting this security hole.  Xitami 2.5b5 is a beta and 
as such we do not recommend its use for production or public web 
sites.  The production release of Xitami (2.4d9) does not use GSL and 
is not subject to this attack.

You should also note that the supplied script is an example that is 
intended to show the available fields, and not hard-coded.  The web 
site manager can easily remove references to any or all information 
coming from the browser.  Further, GSL processing for errors is 
disabled by default.

However, we're grateful for your work and we will make changes to the 
2.5b package to filter all information received from the browser 
before showing it in error screens.

I am forwarding this message to the Xitami discussion list, since we 
do not believe it serves our users to hide information about such 
vulnerabilities.

Best regards,
-
Pieter Hintjens

Actually, I have noticed strange behavior on some machines with the
HINTERNET API (which both IE and Netscape use) where a single request will
actually request the same page twice.  POST is even worse since that API
will first send a POST shortly followed by a GET request (without the POST
data).  This confused me for ages trying to figure out why I was getting
two entries in some database table, one blank, the other had data.

If you want to restrict 'somecgi.exe' to only accept POST requests, then
you need to use getenv("REQUEST_METHOD") in your program and compare the
value to "POST".

Hope this helps!

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami and PHP ??
Message-ID: <3D0DFA00.29.3B074E3@localhost>

I've tried asking this question on the PHP lists, but all I've gotten for 
answers is "fix the CGI" (it's been working fine as far as I can tell) and 
"Use something other than Xitami" (duh - if I wanted to use something else, 
I would)

I'm running a fairly customized Win98 machine.  There is plenty of 
memory, plenty of hard drive.  It's my workstation, so it's sharing a bunch 
of apps with the system, but Xitami seems to run fine.  I've got CGI 
working and the one script I run (a very simple mail client called 
ThinMailer) is working fine except for the fact that my inbox often has 300 
messages or so - it times out on that one.  So, I've downloaded 
Squirrelmail and PHP and have attempted to make them work.  No good.  
Currently, the "test" page grinds and grinds forever, and the status line says, 
"Web site found, waiting for reply" (how long does it take to connect to 
"localhost"?) Then  I get, "This server is currently overloaded - please try 
again later " - what overload? theres's only one program running on the 
server.

Anyway, any hints?

	I'd start by trying to spy on "the wire", see what bytes are being sent &
received. One free net traffic program I use is

	Sometimes it is very useful, it tells you where the network protocol hangs,

Try making a simple PHP script and see if it works.
This one should work:
<html>
<head>
<title>Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<?php
 phpinfo();
?>
</body>
</html>
Also make sure that you have these lines in defaults.cfg in your Xitami folder:
[Filter]
    .php=C:\path_to_php\php.exe
    .php3=C:\path_to_php\php.exe
    .phtm=C:\path_to_php\php.exe

	If you feel like paying, try Ports Traffic Analyzer

	Yes, you can spy the interface "loopback", which is being used in your case

Open Source mailing lists are usually not very helpful in my own personal
experience (others may have experienced otherwise).  I'm on this list to
help people...sometimes I do, other times I don't.  Hey, that's life!  :)

I personally know the Ehresmans (founders of SquirrelMail).  So, I have a
small amount of knowledge of how it works.

Ahh...I've had this problem before with Xitami.  This is (most likely)
related to the PHP Header("Location: ...") function.  The problem is that
the PHP script is causing the browser to redirect to a non-HTTP-standard
page since PHP is _assuming_ the server will do the re-direct (such scripts
are designed for Apache with PHP as a compiled module).  Now, don't get
your hopes up, but I would give XiFusion v2.5 a shot.  You can get it from
the Shining Light Productions website:

<http://www.shininglightpro.com/>

Follow the 'readme.txt' file and let us know if it works.  If it doesn't,
try again when XiFusion v2.6 comes out (v2.6 does re-direction differently).

Hope this helps!

Message-ID: <3.0.6.32.20020618193225.00a38d70@mail.shininglightpro.com>

Shining Light Productions is having a **HUGE** software release party and
you are all invited to come and download XiFusion v2.6!  XiFusion allows
Xitami and ColdFusion to work together (and helps PHP work better)!

However, when Shining Light Productions says, "party," the Company really
does mean a party!  Not only is XiFusion v2.6 being released, but 5 other
applications and Open Software Debugging Functions are being released as well!

While you head over and grab XiFusion v2.6, be sure to check these out as
well:

Nuclear Vision v1.0 (An easy-to-use, HTML-style scripting language)
GetWebPg (Grabs webpages via the command-line - optionally displays headers
too)
SMTPSend (Sends e-mail via the command-line)
POP3Get (Retrieves e-mail via the command-line)
QuickFTP (A one-shot command-line FTP client)


Also, if you are a CGI developer (or do any type of C/C++ programming), be
sure to download the Open Software Debugging Functions!  They will aid you
in pinpointing application crashes as well as find memory leaks and profile
your code!

Cool toys await you at the Shining Light Productions software release party!

Now your saying the test program that

I think this clues a configuration problem
check your logs and set the php.ini to log errors
this all should give you a start were to look
you are putting the .php files in your webpages

Hi,

	I am asking this on behalf of a friend. Sending to the list because it may be
useful to others, and seems to be the preferred contact the developers anyway
(http://runner.conacom.de/support.html).

	Is it possible to map logical URL names to the actual servlet class ? How ?

	This is what I mean:

http://..../servlet/Registration is the URL I want people to use, and I want
"Registration" in the URL to actually map to class
com.mycompany.MyRegistrationClass, for example. In other words, I'd like to have
classes in packages and have the URL string be a simpler, shorter name.

	Is that possible with this servlet engine + Xitami ?

	thanks,

marcio

Well, FWIW, I've seen it too for some PHP-based mail programs, NOCC specifically. Basically, on my pitiful little server, NOCC needs one second per message in the inbox. I increased the PHP.INI timeout value from 30 to like 240, and that helps solve the timeout issue, but not the lack of speed issue.

Sometimes I will get the exact error message you are reporting immediately, even if there aren't that many messages in an inbox. I've just attributed it general slowness with PHP/CGI for Xitami for windows for some PHP functions.

In contrast, another PHP mailers, UbiMeao (am I spelling that right?) will present the inbox within about 5 seconds, regardless of how many messages there are. Save server and Xitami version.

Subject: [Xitami] Security for image files for CGI app
Message-ID: <007301c217d7$8c660960$0300a8c0@aplusnet.com>

I'm developing a CGI web server application
that accepts customer orders of customized
items -- basically a fulfillment inventory system.
I authenticate users against a database.

All the webpages are generated from templates
stored outside the website scope, so they are
secure.

One aspect is the display of product thumbnails
and full-size images. Since the client's browser
needs to pull these from the server, they have to
be in the scope of Xitami's website -- rather than the CGI
application -- which makes them accessible via
a direct URL to anyone.

If I protect the product image directory with
Xitami's security then that will require the
user to enter a separate password for the
HTTP/1.0 Basic Authentication protocol, and I
don't want that.

Any suggestions?

You could use Perl or another programming language to open the image file, print the content type of the image, print the image, and
then close the file.
An example in perl:
open(IMAGE,"/path_to_images/image.gif");
print "Content-Type: image/gif\n\n";
foreach (<IMAGE>){
    print;
}
close(IMAGE);

Yes I could stream an image from my CGI, but I can't
figure out how to do that with thumbnails embedded
in an HTML table.

For example:

<table>
  <tr><td><a href="/inv/imgs/pic1.jpg" target="img"><img
src="/inv/imgs/pic1_small.jpg"></a>checkbox, description etc.<td>
  </td></td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="/inv/imgs/pic2.jpg" target="img"><img
src="/inv/imgs/pic2_small.jpg"></a>checkbox, description etc.<td>
  </td></td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="/inv/imgs/pic3.jpg" target="img"><img
src="/inv/imgs/pic3_small.jpg"></a>checkbox, description etc.<td>
  </td></td></tr>
</table>

You can't stream individual components of a page at once,
right?

I guess I could write a separate CGI app to stream each image
on demand as part of the HREF, but that seems like an awful
extra load to call a CGI for each image. Just hoped there might
be a better solution.

By the way, the server is Xitami 2.4d9, running on Win2k Pro.
App is developed with Delphi 5.

So what if strangers can see the images?

Another approach is to link the image tag to a CGI app that delivers
the actual image, if it wants to. Typically you have one such app
and pass the filename (possibly path-less or obfuscated) on the
command line after a "?" in the URL. The CGI tries to figure if the
person is known and actually shopping before it delivers the image.

their thumbnails without storing the thumbnails separately as static files.
You can store the image files outside the website scope, and let the LRWP
application authenticate subsequent requests by reading a random cookie that
was passed to the user after the initial authentication.
The LRWP peer is supposed to work faster than the CGI.

I do not understand why do you have to write a separate CGI for each image.
Just identify them in the URL encoding.

I hope this helps.

Hi!=20
I read all 2002 postings and did not find any, I am looking for.
I am new to network and xitami is installed under linux. So far so good =
except configuring .aut and .cfg.
There are a lot of sections and entries to modified for default files. I =
don't know which section and in it, which entry I need in order to host =
webpages for a start.

Sample files or a few lines will be very much appreciated.

Thanks,
Myint

steer clear of those files.  just edit them with the webpage (foo.com/admin)
after executing "xiconfig" and then "xitami".  it works as long as you save all
your changes as you go.

Sokrates is never using class names as URL. 

place your classname into the "class=" parameter and
"/servlet/Registration" into the "servletidentifier=" parameter.
you can use "/Registration" or "/registration.html" als
servletidentifier too.

Message-ID: <200206200949.g5K9npD0055305@smtpzilla2.xs4all.nl>

Hello,

I succesfully installed and configured Sokrates and the latest build for 
OS/2 of Xitami on my OS/2 testserver, only to find out Sokrates supports 
Java Servlet API 2.1 (okay, that is listed on the website as well) and 
Jive Forums (www.jivesoftware.com) requires 2.2 (that's only in the 
readme of Jive) 

Anyway, the obvious question is:

- did anyone try to get this combo to work?
- is there any chance it will work at all?
- (if not) is there any chance Sokrates will support the Servlet 2.2 API?

Thanks in advance, especially to mr. Hohmann for the excellent OS/2 
support!

Regards,

Joachim

API 2.2 has only minor differences to API 2.1 in the servlet
core. 

BUT: API 2.2 introduced JSP pages and this is much harder to
implement and needs some 3rd party tools (XML parsers, compiler
tool packages from java 1.3, DTD files).

We will think about it. My coworker Ender thinks that it needs
1.5-2 weeks (which means we're spending about 6000 EUR) to
create a solution which works fast, is easy to use and working
under 1.1.8 to 1.4.

Okay, but I could try to get it to work then? As maybe (didn't check yet) Jive 
Forums do not use/require JSP? Hm, just checked, and it *does* use JSP :-(

Okay... well, maybe you should run a poll on it, or see if there is enough 
interest to let this investment be worth your effort.

copy xitamipro.exe into your current directory and start xitamipro (or
xipro.exe) instead of xitami.exe.

as per default you can access all your pages with https:// instead of
http://.

don't know if you can switch https:// off for specifig domains.

but the PRO version came with documentation as far as i know.

Hi,

I have been through this myself.
The first suggestion is to unzip Xitami Pro in another folder, preferably in
the root, like c:\Xipro and keep your previous Xitami config
handy/functional in case things go wrong. run xitami pro from the console,
do not use it as a service yet. Open a DOS box and run xipro -d. If anything
is wrong it will be output in the console. For example, xipro will complain
about missing logs directory. Create it manually.

Yes, first COPY your configs and dir structure, do not remove them yet.
Remove when you get everything working.

The best would be to try it out on a test machine, get it working and make
changes quickly on your server afterwards.
There are a few tricky configs especially for the SSL. I replied with a few
of them when people asked previously about Xitami Pro.

Because it's the pro version it means that you would be able to handle SSL
(i.e. HTTPS requests, port 443), however if one type HTTP instead of HTTPS
the nonsecure versions of the webpages you serve is available. You might
want to restrict HTTPS to only sensitive data forms, because HTTPS
encryption slows things down.

The keys you generate them yourself using ssleay tool. The certificates will
be therefore self issued unless you buy one from verisign or other.. This
self issued thing will make a window pop up in IE which asks the user if
he/she chooses to trust the issuer (i.e. yourself), other than that
everything is fine, as long as you match the certificate issuer with the
actual site address and your certificate is valid. By default, the ssleay
configuraiton file (sslcert.cfg) makes certificates which are valid only 1
month. Use the parameter -days (e.g. -days 365) to extend the validity of
the self issued cert. to a year.

here's  a paste of makecertificateLONG.bat which I derived from  make
certificate.bat
use it to generate your key and certificate.

@echo off
Echo Do you wish to make a new certificate (press Ctrl-C to cancel)?
Pause
ssleay genrsa -rand .rnd -out key.pem 1024
ssleay req -new -key key.pem -out cert.pem -x509 -days 365 -config
sslcert.cfg
del .rnd


There is a problem with an config entry in the sslhttp.cfs configuraiton
file. I will paste the ssl section here and you'll make the difference.

[Ssl]
    cert-key=key.pem                    #   Server key
    cert-file=cert.pem                  #   Server certificate
    ca-cert-path=certs                  #   Certificate authorities path
#    ca-cert-file=ca-cert.pem            #   Certificate authorities file
#   For Thawte test certificates
    ca-cert-file=certs\thawteca.pem           #   Server certificate
    required-ciphers=
    verify-client=0
    verify-depth=10

Actually the difference is that you have to specify path info in
ca-cert-file (e.g. ca-cert-file=certs\thawteca.pem) otherwise the server
won't find the certificate and complain in the console.

Read ssldoc.txt again, it actually contains the bare necessity.


Good luck

Subject: [Xitami] HELP! Upgrading to Xitami Pro


Ok, folks need some serious help here, i don't have a lot of time to do
research on this - so I need the crash course.

I am running the normal Xitami and am upgrading to Xitami Pro.  As usual,
there is hardly ANY documentation on how to do this step by step.  Do I
install to same directory OR do I install to a new directory and copy my
previous configs/directory structure over?  Because it is the Pro version
does that mean EVERY site is going to be a secure site - or can I only turn
the secure feature on for specific pages or links within each site?  Are
there tricky configurations I need to be aware of.  I do know I am supposed
to get a KEY from somewhere, but again, I don't understand this process.  I
don't want to disrupt my current installation.

I am in a bind and need to upgrade fast b/c one of my sites needs to do
Credit Card transactions.  So any and all help is very appreciated.  I have
never worked with SSL and I am worried about the time involved to get this
all working.

To really understand SSL, you really should read the HTTPS RFC.  However,
since you are in a time crunch, let me take you quickly through what is
involved.

First off, your entire site can be run under SSL/TLS (if you want).  The
tricky part is to remember that the SSL/TLS protocol provides no means for
VHosting except by IP address under Xitami Pro.  This is due to the nature
of the SSL/TLS protocols and not Xitami.  The problem is that when an
SSL-capable client connects, the SSL server certificate that gets sent is
the one tied to the IP address and there is no way to determine what VHost
the client wants until after authentication.  This is, IMO, the biggest
blunder the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) ever made.

Second, all of your current configuration files can be the same as for
Xitami.  The SSL config is located in HTTPSSL.CFS (or something like that).
 Just edit the SSL config to point at the proper certificates needed for
the server.

Finally, you need a certificate chain.  This will consist of a root
certificate authority encrypted private key (e.g. Verisign) and your own
certificate that is signed by the owner of the private key of the root
cert.  You need both the encrypted server private key and unencrypted
server private key in order to get Xitami Pro to work.  Let me warn you
that Verisign signed certs. are *EXTREMELY* expensive and there are cheaper
alternatives to using their certs.

>I am in a bind and need to upgrade fast b/c one of my sites needs to do
Credit Card transactions.  So any and all help is very appreciated.  I have
never worked with SSL and I am worried about the time involved to get this
all working.

Make sure that your user has a merchant account before going to the trouble
of setting up SSL so quickly.  If they don't have a merchant account, it
will take them about 2-3 weeks (minimum) to get one.

Hope this helps!

I went through the exact same thing.

You need to go to thawte.com and get a certificate.

Give them a call, talk to them, and they will walk you through it.

Be warned that it will take you a few days at least.

They need to check you out, and its a pain in the butt.

Not to mention costs some money.

But then you get the certificate, which is just a tiny file.

You need to put the file in the Xitami Pro directory.

And I think you need to change one of the config files in Xitami to

tell it you are using a Thawte certificate.

(Specifics Anyone?)

Play around, read over and over the tiny docs you get with Xitami Pro,

you will get it.

Since I did not want to risk screwing up my already working Xitami site,

I just installed Xitami Pro into a separate directory, then went through =
and

reconfigured it to work the way I wanted.  I wouldn't just copy config =
files

from Xitami to Xitami Pro, because they are probably different versions.

Once you get Xitami Pro installed, and you have moved all your files =
over, and regular

pages are coming up, you are ready to test a secure page.

I scoured the internet trying to figure out how to do it, and of course

nothing anywhere, like everyone already knew, and I was stupid.

Secure pages?  So simple we don't even talk about it!

YA, THANKS WORLD!!!

So, for all of you wanting to know what the deal is with secure web =
pages,

here it is.

Simply link to your pages using 'https://' instead of 'http://'

That's it as far as the HTTP code is concerned.

The browser and server figure it out behind the scenes.

One little trick though, if you are using a router, and are blocking all

the ports except port 80, keep in mind that when you use https instead

of http, it does not use port 80.  And guess what, I cant remember which

port it uses, I want to say port 160 or something.  Dig around on the =
internet,

or ask your local service provider pointy head, they will probably know, =
or if some one

else knows, please pipe up.

Oh, and if you want to do actual credit card processing, that is a whole =
another

can of worms.  I looked around, and I think the best deal/service was =
Card Service.

They own LinkPoint, ( www.linkpoint.com ) they have their own servers, =
and it was pretty simple to get

my perl scripts running credit cards.  They are sort of a one stop shop.

They also had the most features.  Screw Verisign.

But that will also take up to a week, (if you push them),

to get the account setup, and get ANOTHER certificate they

will give you so you can link up to their servers.  Don't worry, their =
scripts handle=20

everything, and they have some awesome samples, not to mention their =
help

desk for programming the credit card processing is very good.  Again,

screw Verisign.

One thing is for sure, when your done, and it all works, and you figured =
it

out by yourself, you kinda feel like a bad ass.  :)

Good luck!!!

The reason I am interested in Jive, is because it integrates email, nntp and 
webbased forums in one messagebase. If you know any other package that can do 
this (outside Lotus Notes which failed us miserably) I would really like to hear 
about it!

Thanks,

Joachim

not a big deal for xitami & sokrates (in theory).

how about this: we will implement API 2.2 and JSP support in Sokrates
and Imatix will release Xitami 3.0 with <servlet> tag support (maybe a
Xitami version which supports unbuffered output too) ?

a small step for both packages but a big step for mankind.

pieter, ewen ?

 Your bit below, about SSL and VHosting?  This means that b/c I have 8
domains sharing one IP address that SSL will prevent my Vhosts from working?

Example A: my example config would be: (server has ONE IP addresses,
x.x.x.10)
http://www.domain1.com = domain1.cfg
http://www.domain2.com = domain2.cfg
https://www.domain3.com = domain3.cfg
http://www.domain4.com = domain4.cfg

A1: Wlll  this not work?
A2: Or does each domain have to have its own IP address (is this because of
SSL and reverse DNS issues?)

Example B: What about within a domain (aliasing SSL directories) :
http://www.domain1.com
http://www.domain1.com/cgi-bin/
https://www.domain1.com/cgi-bin/secure  (SSL secure path)
http://www.domain1.com/pages

B1: Can SSL work in this fashion?
B2: Or will the whole doamin be SSL referenced by: https:// ?

B3. If the answer to B1 is YES, then will A1 still work in relation to
Example A.

Thanks again guys...

I've been really trying hard to debug this problem.  Here's a new one (for 
me)  I ran PHP against test.php at the command prompt and saved the 
output in a file ending with .htm   The output is beautiful and is exactly what 
should be showing up on the web server.  Now, any ideas why running 
test.php against php.exe at the command prompt works, but not running it 
on the server?

    I know everyone is having this problem with PHP and Xitami trying to
send mail with the mail command. It's not just Xitami though its also apache
and all servers. I havn't been able to figure it out yet but I just wanted
to let everyone know that. It's not just you everyone is having the same
problem.

    I am currently searching very hard for an answer and havn't had any luck
just yet but will keep everyone posted on my progress.

More errors - this time from attempting to run Squirrel Mail the same way.  Maybe 
some of these will ring a bell with a more experienced user.  One thing that I have 
done is to move the Squirrel Mail directory under the PHP directory (I had it off 
elsewhere before)  It looks like I need to either create a directory called TMP or 
tell the scripts to use a different directory.

Have you setup a filter to parse all .php files. The filter should lead to

we found a very strange thing... 

when an IE 5 user tries to set a session-cookie on a Sokrates
1.4 running under Linux with Xitami beta-5 it never sends back
the cookie.

Netscape or Mozilla against this machine: no problem.

IE 5 against an OS/2 box: no problem.

strange....

ok, problem solved. the time on the Linux server was in the past
so the cookie was "dead on arrival" for the IE. have to handle
this and create some switches in the next version.

Would someone from Imatix like to explain (again) to bugtraq that read 
access to any configuration file whether or not it contains passwords is 
a huge security hole. But that in windows with no user access control 
you can't hide files.

Note that my (test) installation of Apache also has a clear text config 
file in the conf directory. Any user on a windoes machine can read and 
write any file in that directory also. Since I removed IIS for being a 
security hazard I have no idea whether IIS also has a similar config 
file/directory but I'll bet that if not anyone runing regedit would be 
in luck

Message-ID: <20020621133738.51312.qmail@web9604.mail.yahoo.com>

My webserver is on a ip-address (say a.b.c.d)

I've got two different domains (say www.domain1.com
and www.domain2.com)

I want the first domain to redirect to:
c:\inetpub\wwwroot
and the second to:
c:\inetpub\wwwroot\domain2

How should I do this in the xitami.cfg ???

I've looked at the [virtual-hosts] section but it does
not work, www.domain2.com still goes to the root of
domain1 instead of the subfolder?

Thanks in advance,

The problem is not that the configuration file is in plain text.

The problem is that the "passwords" are in "plaintext", not "cyphertext". 
Any user with read access to the file - all users on Windows 9X/ME and 
non-NTFS drives - can read those passwords.

A typical solution is to place a "hash" of the password into the file.

So what?
a) The passwords will be sent over the wire as base64 encoded which is 
essentially plaintext since it is NOT a 1-way hash. These passwords are 
therefore nothing close to secure anyway which is why no one uses them 
for web authentication in places where security is an issue.
b) The problem is the lack of windows user/file ownership not the 
plaintextness of the passwords. If you have console access to a windows 
machine running any webserver you can do anything you want. The fact 
that you have access to the password file is a trivial side-effect.

>

Encyphering these passwords would actually give a misleading sense of 
security since it is so easy to see them over the wire.

By the way

If you want to have secure password access the bets way is to use a cgi 
program to set a cookie and a GSL or similar script to read the cookie 
and display the page if it matches that in a XML hash file. This can be 
quite general purpose (i.e. you can do 
http://server/secure.gsl?/path/file.htm to display arbitrary files but 
with an initial security check to see if this should be permitted)

If anyone wants the code for the above I would be happy to share it 
somewhere once I have tidied it up a bit. It really isn't complicated 
once you decice how to allocate the permissions.

Subject: [Xitami] New to list / couple q's..
Message-ID: <F86b6KZmcK8r6beUzmR00005555@hotmail.com>


  Hello,

  I'm new to the list, but have not seen ANY posts since I've joined. I'm 
not sure how it works, and if I'm doing wrong someone please let me know.

  I have several questions regarding the xitami server, but until I'm sure 
I'm doing this right, I will limit it to just one for now.

  Whenever I build a new directory on my site, (for example): "home", and 
fill it with pages such as pages: one, two and three, to access these pages 
you would go to www.mydomain/home/one.html, or www.mydomain/home/two.html, 
etc..  However, if someone simply types in: www.mydomain/home/  and hits 
enter, a page is shown as that root directory, and lists all of the files 
within that folder.  Is there any way to hide that page as the root 
directory?  I would like it if users could NOT access that page showing that 
whole folders contents, by individual files!  My reason for this is that I 
often keep dupes, and experimental pages inside the same folder as is 
public, and I would like for the user to only be able to access files that I 
create a link to.  I hope I explained this well enough for "someone" to 
answer it!  Thanks in advance for any help with this!  Once again, if I am 
posting wrong, or going about this wrong, please let me know so I can 
correct it!  Good day all!

Well I don't know when you joined but there have been posts today. You 
should get this message twice as I'm sending it direct to you and to the

Alternatively if using the web based admin tool you should uncheck the " 
Allow directory lists?  " checkbox in the security page.

Well, yeah that will happen if your PHP.INI file is configured incorrectly.
 If you look on line 24 of 'C:\PHP\squirrelmail\functions\gettext.php', you
see that 'session_register('gettext_php_loaded');' is the function call on
that line.

Going to www.php.net, you can find out that session_register() starts a new
session and adds a variable/string/whatnot to the session.  Based on this
it should be seen that session_register can't create a new file called
'/tmp\sess_18ba7237a4d01d6fe12ca7773ffa4091' because:

1)  This isn't *NIX (duh).
2)  There is no '/tmp' directory on the local machine.
3)  No filesystem on the face of this planet (AFAIK) fully accepts
mixed-slash notation.
4)  Your PHP.INI file is configured incorrectly for session management.

The solution to this problem is to fix the session management issues:

1)  Create a directory called 'C:\TEMP' on the local machine (name it
whatever you want).
2)  Locate 'session.save_path = /tmp' in the PHP.INI file and change it to
'session.save_path = c:\temp'.

Try SquirrelMail again.  It should work this time (provided that you have
run the config.pl tool and configured it properly).

I have no idea why you put SquirrelMail with PHP as the root directory.
There is no need for that since it will work fine even under a Xitami VHost.

In the future, you should note that this list is for Xitami-specific
issues.  PHP issues should be directed elsewhere.  At this point, PHP is
working fine with Xitami, and so any issues with SquirrelMail/PHP should be
directed at the appropriate locations.

BTW, PHP is working fine on my machine with SquirrelMail via XiFusion v2.6.
 So, there is probably something wrong with your setup if you can't get
XiFusion and PHP to work together.

Hope this helps!

Hello

- disable "directory listing" in admin

Hope that helps.

No, VHosting will still work, the problem is that SSL won't know which set
of certificates to send for the host the user wants.  So, you have to do
one of two things for the certs:

1)  Get certs. for *.somedomain.com (where somedomain.com is a domain you
own).  Then, create virtual hosts called domain1.somedomain.com,
domain2.somedomain.com, etc. for each domain that is on your servers.
Then, require people to connect to https://domain1.somedomain.com/ for
SSL-based stuff.  Note that this is one option that I'm not quite sure
about the setup for since Craig (my web host provider) is starting to
experiment with it.  Generating the certs. for this was based on the RFC
for HTTPS.  I'm crossing my fingers that it will work and the browser will
like it (i.e. assumes the browser is 100% HTTPS-compliant).

2)  Get certs. for www.somedomain.com (somedomain.com is your own domain
still) and require your users to point to
https://www.somedomain.com/domain1root/ for SSL-based access.  This only
requires setting up an alias rather than a whole sub-domain.  The down-side
is slightly more difficult scripting on the user end of things.

3)  If only one client will be using SSL, the client can purchase the cert.
and the others can use it, but their users will get a warning in their
browser that they don't own the cert.  Note, however, this option does not
easily scale.

>Example B: What about within a domain (aliasing SSL directories) :
>http://www.domain1.com
>http://www.domain1.com/cgi-bin/
>https://www.domain1.com/cgi-bin/secure  (SSL secure path)

>
>B1: Can SSL work in this fashion?
>B2: Or will the whole doamin be SSL referenced by: https:// ?

The whole domain is covered by SSL.  All SSL/TLS does is provide a secure
transport of data without understanding of the underlying representation of
the data it is securing.  Hence it can't know what virtual host the browser
is going to use since it doesn't understand that level of data (the HTTP
protocol).  As I said before, if you want to really understand how SSL/TLS
works with HTTP, you need to read the RFCs.

Hope this helps!

Read my message again.  The only way I could get that output was to run 
the program AT A DOS PROMPT and record the results.  IT STILL 
DOES NOT RUN IN XITAMI.  All it does in Xitami is return a blank 
page with ABSOLUTELY NOT HTML FORMATTING AT ALL.  I 
would be happy if I could get the error results to show using Xitami, then I 
would consider it a PHP or Squirrel Mail configuration problem.  So far, 
with any PHP script I have run I get the same results - A BLANK PAGE.  
I can run the test.php and hello.php files AT A DOS PROMPT and record 
the correct results to a text file, so PHP is running fine - except for 
configuring Squirrel Mail.  I have asked repeatedly on PHP lists about this 
problem, they all say it is an Xitami problem and advise me to get another 
web server.

Yup, and moved it once.  One time I had it in defaults, the other in xitami - 
it doesn't seem to make a difference.

Have a temp directory and temp and tmp vars declared in startup.  PHP.ini 
did NOT have a session.save_path defined.  I wonder what else it is 
missing.  Still gives a blank output with test.php (although there is at least 
basic HTML text in the file now)  I have also included c:\php in the 
PATH= statement - I wonder what other programs are supposed to be

cool, your explanations helped alot...I think I can take it from here.  At

Actually if I remember correctly your setup would have to be like this:
CertDomain.com
CertDomain.com/Company1
CertDomain.com/Company2
CertDomain.com/Company3
Etc.
or:
www.CertDomain.com
www.CertDomain.com/Company1
www.CertDomain.com/Company2
www.CertDomain.com/Company3
As to add even a www.CertDomain.com requires a new certificate I believe.

Try naming 'one.html' to 'index.htm' or 'index.html'.  Unless you have
messed with the default server configuration, that should take care of the
problem.

Hope this helps!

Well, that's true only if the cert isn't a *.CertDomain.com cert.  However,
according to the HTTPS RFC, only sub-domains work.  So, with a
*.CertDomain.com cert. the sub-domain my.www.CertDomain.com will fail a
browser check, but www.CertDomain.com won't.

That, of course, __assumes__ that all browsers follow the HTTPS RFC 100%.

Hope this helps!

Umm...re-install PHP?  If you are missing items in your PHP.INI file, you
either copied the wrong one (e.g. the optimized INI, try using the default
INI file), the installation of PHP is corrupt (unlikely), you are using a
different version of PHP than what SquirrelMail works with (unlikely - but
if this is the case, I would download the latest CVS repository), or you
have drastically changed the PHP config from the default settings (most
likely).

My first suggestion is to uninstall PHP and re-install it.  SquirrelMail
should work when PHP is properly installed.  Copy php4ts.dll from c:\php to
c:\winnt\system32 (or c:\windows\system32 - depends on the OS).  Copy
php.ini-dist from c:\php to c:\winnt and rename it to php.ini.  Finally,
don't touch the INI settings.  Now, in the [Filters] section of Xitami make
sure PHP is defined (hand-edit the config to rule out web-admin-based
problems):

[Filters]
  .php=c:\php\php.exe

Restart the OS (this guarantees that all loaded DLLs are flushed from
memory).  Run the following PHP script across localhost:

<?
phpinfo();
?>

If that doesn't work, something is:

1)  Inherently wrong with your ability to follow directions (unlikely).
2)  Xitami is corrupt (unlikely, but try re-installing it - install the
latest stable release so that we are on the same page - I'm using 2.4d9
locally).

OR
3)  Your OS is corrupt (most likely - I've never heard of anyone having
this much trouble with the PHP/Xitami combination - not even with the beta
versions of Xitami).  The only solution to this is to try standard OS
repair utilities (e.g. installing IE - IE has kernel patches embedded
within the installation program).  If the registry is shot, then there is
no solution except to re-install the OS or drop an installation image.

Once PHP is working, modify the INI to properly support session management:

Next, re-install SquirrelMail.  Run the config.pl script and configure it.
Run SquirrelMail on Xitami.

If all of that doesn't work, then something is wrong at a level lower than
software (your hardware is messed up - or something is interfering with
Xitami/PHP such as a virus or firewall software).

Hope this helps!

If you look at the problem report again, they don't have an issue with web 
authentication.

The problem is that the administrators username and password are saved in 
plaintext in the configuration file. Anyone with local access to the 
computer has access to the administrators username and password - and all 
other passwords, since Xitami stores all passwords in plaintext.

No, that is not a trivial side-effect. It is not even a side effect. A 
"choice" was made to leave the password in plaintext!


Imatix,

Why were the passwords in the configuration files (default.aut, 
ftpusers.aut, etc.) left in plaintext? Is there any plan to change that?

it's in the FAQ.

http://WWW.YOUR_DOMAIN.COM/xitami/index18.htm

7: Why is the password file not encrypted?
In general if access to your server is secure, then the lack of encryption is
not a problem. If someone can read the Xitami directory on your system, they
can see the 
passwords. Note that even if you use a hashed password file, it is often
trivial to discover passwords using a dictionary-based attack. It's therefore
much better to concentrate 
on hiding the password file than on encrypting it. At some future date,
Xitami will support encrypted (hashed) passwords. 


there you go.  if people have access to the localhost, you've got bigger
problems that plaintext passwords.

Hi all.

I have the xitami up and runnig with php

Now i have developed a scipt (php) but i seem to have a right problem.

On I.E. a linux machine i can give a directory a CHMOD command to set =
the rights that are needed.

Can someone tell me how to set these rights on directorys on my windows =

Thanks again

True. But, "joe user" generally does not know how to perform a 
dictionary-based attack. Again, it does add a level a security.

Great!

There's the problem in a nutshell. With Windows 9X/ME and on non-NTFS 
Windows NT/2K/XP systems, the machine will require "physical security". For 
most of our "home" systems, this is not an option.

Thanks for your response!

Create an NT user account
Go to service panel, assign this user to Xitami
On the C:\Xitami Folder right click and set permissions.
The folder where your web pages are, the PHP EXE and your PHP scripts, set permissions to this Xitami user.

A good book on NT security is ... " Securing Windows NT/200 Servers"
Works for NT Workstation too.
It goes step by step, avoiding all the theory that fills pages.

1. Leave NT at the login screen. This keeps snoopers out.
2. Your 'Guest' accounts should not have permission to Xitami folder.
3. SSL will help secure the connection.

Xitami can't be at fault for a machine that is not locked down.

this is very true, and i think someone who's truly security-conscious should
eschew the fat32-based operating systems.

Message-ID: <3D151F10.23574.5DC4F1A@localhost>

I'm running Xitami 2.4d7 right now for OS/2.  When things get busy (I think users are 
uploading their files with FTP and checking there web directories) Xitami crashes quite a 
bit. :(  The error is: " error on select():  Socket operation on non-socket Clean-memory 
assertion failed - xitami.c (208). " Xitami dies then reloads from my batch file.  Is there 
some way to prevent Xitami from crashing this way or crashing less often?  I really don't 
want a crash after a FTP use (if this is what is happening?).  Any insight would be 
appreciated!

now works.

I'm trying to build the Xitami console code, but it fails to link, can't find wsock32.obj.

Using CBuilder, not sure which library to bring into the project.  Also, thought it should be looking for winsock, not wsock32?

Thanks.

Hmm...I didn't think Xitami built with anything but Visual Studio/Visual C++.

Actually, the target is _almost_ correct.  The correct file should be
wsock32.lib for Borland products.  If you don't have wsock32.lib in the
lib\PSDK directory of your Builder install, you can create one with the
command-line 'implib' utility Borland provides (although, only the latest
Builder products comes with the fastdef utility which optimizes the
resulting .lib files).

Hope this helps!

I think the FAQ answers the 'why', and I don't see any flaws in the 
original reasoning: if someone can read your password files, then (a) 
they can use dictionary-based attacks, and (b) your general security 
has been compromised and that is much more serious than whether the 
passwords are hashed or not (and the extra hour or two that takes for 
someone to crack enough of them to get into your server).

My personal opinion is that flagrantly unsecured password files are 
actually a 'feature' since they oblige the system administrator to 
think seriously about security issues (such as running NTFS vs. 
FAT32).

But that may just be laziness.  We've always planned to implement 
password hashing at some stage.  Given that this issue keeps coming 
back, we'll look at this for the next release.

The planned design is this: we will keep the existing file 
structures, and put the hashing logic inside Xitami.  When it reads a 
password file, it will hash any (new) unhashed passwords.  We don't 
want to break scripts that create password files.

However, the problem still won't go away since anyone sniffing for packets
can grab any HTTP Authorization header and store it away for a later replay
attack (MD5 hashes included).  What is worse is that Xitami doesn't have
DIGEST mode available which means that the username:password combination is
only Base64 encoded (and makes it _VERY_ easy to obtain access to "secure"
areas - e.g. remote /admin access).  Even with DIGEST mode, it still
doesn't stop a replay attack since the HTTP protocol doesn't have any
secure handshaking methods.

So, hashing the files might help some locally, but won't stop anyone from
attacking the server remotely.  The problem is not necessarily with Xitami
but also has to do with the inherent weakness of the HTTP protocol.

Hope this helps!

Message-ID: <20020624132110.B42A3ADF71@basilica.la.naos.co.nz>

Hi Folks,

We (iMatix) are in the middle of moving some domains from one DNS server
to another DNS server.  One of the domains being moved is "xitami.org",
as used by lists.xitami.org for this mailing list.

It is possible that for a (hopefully) short period of time during this
move the domain xitami.org, and hence lists.xitami.org, may be
inaccessible, at least to some people.

To help ensure that the mailing list remains available during this
period, I have configured "lists.xitami.com" (note ".com", not ".org")
as a backup name for the mailing list, viz:

http://lists.xitami.com/mailman/listinfo/xitami

xitami@lists.xitami.com

If you have trouble with the main address (lists.xitami.org) this week 
please try the lists.xitami.com address instead.

I don't know if this has been brought up before, but
you can always configure Xitami to only allow admin
access from localhost and use encrypted tunneling via
ssh (http://www.openssh.com/)
or zebedee (http://www.winton.org.uk/zebedee/)
to open a secure connection to the web server
host to do administrative stuff with Xitami.
Either way, HTTP text will be sent through an encrypted
tunnel via port forwarding.

I use zebedee to do this all the time with Xitami.

For windows, you can try http://www.cygwin.com for ssh.
I think it has a sshd too.

Discus works well in the *nix environment, I have a user installing it

Win32/ActivePerl env.

Do a google for it.

I don't think I could give better instructions 
than are on the Discusware site. They also have 
a very helpful discussion board (how 'bout 
that!). Not sure about your php error since 
Discus uses Perl not php on my board 
(Win2k/Activeperl).

Hy,

we've installed Xitami 2.5b5 on a SUSE-Linux machine.

The server works fine, but we have a little problem using CGI (Perl) -
scripts.

I'll try to explain the problem with a little example.

A perl-script should load a file with config parameters and it's not
possible for us to set the full and absolute path ahead the config file.
After executing the script in a cgi directory off the webserver we got
the message, that the script can not found this file.

The reason we found is, that the execution directory of the perl script
is: /xitami/xitami-25b5.
Xitami executes the scripts in this directory an not in our special perl
script dir.

We found this problem with the following perl script:
my $syst = `pwd`;
print "[$syst]";

The output we got, was [/xitami/xitami-25b5], but it should be
[/the/path/to/my/script]!

How can we configure Xitami, that a cgi script gets executed in their
own directory ?
A modification of the perl scripts is not possible at time.

Best regards and thank you for your help

Bala,

Xitami does not natively run ASP pages.  What your seeing is the server 
serving the raw, unfiltered ASP page.  Only PWS and IIS natively 
supports Active Server Pages.  

There are some emulator, such as the one put out by Sun/ChilliSoft and 
Halcyonsoft.  As of right now Xitami/iMatix does not plan on building 
any native support for ASP scripting into Xitami.

Cold Fushion, PHP, Perl and several can easily be setup on Xitami. ASP 
has been an extensive topic of conversion.  I sure you could review the 
archives and see why.

Even Apache cannot run ASP without Halcyon or Chilisoft.
Only IIS can run ASP without the emulators.

What do you need to do.

1. Switch to JSP, PHP or Cold Fusion
2. Buy (they don't give away) Halcyon or Chilisoft. ( Hold your breath for the price !)
3. Switch to the 'free' IIS.

I would like to have your suggestions for the following:

Then I can have e:\ as a portable USB drive to work with (update) between
machines.

Is there a way to redirect as soon as a user hits an c:
\xitami\webpages\index.htm?

Should I just install xitami on the USB drive?

Hoping for recommendations.

I wouldn't install it on the USB drive, but that's just me.

You can change the path of the \xitami\webpages\ directory by opening the
xitami.cfg (located in the xitami directory) and assigning the server
locations to your e:\ drive. This way it recognizes the server as your e:\
drive instead of the default location.

If you do this there is no need to redirect your users between drives.

That's just my thoughts.

-Rob

I can think of two ways to do what you are thinking.  You can use vhost to assign 
different web pages to different drives.  You can set in Xitami what drive and where to 
put it's webpages directory.  If you want a low level drive letter fix I suggest a util based 
on SUBST.  SUBST.EXE was originaly created for the old DOS (when we had lots of 
tiny drives ;).  What it does is make a "Drive" (say D: drive) into a directory on another 
hard drive.  Using subst.exe (or a up to date GPL port as MS does not include this any 
more) you could take your E: drive and make it the "webpages" directory of 
"c:\xitami\webpages" or wherever you wanted to put it.  I haven't had a need for it 
recently.  But I still have a copy of SUBST120 on my hard drive (this is a version for 
OS/2) I got off hobbes.  If you are running WIN9x/ME then you will want to look for a 
DOS copy.  If your running WIN2000/NT/XP then you'll want a NT version.  I usialy find 
remakes of these drivers on yahoo through third party programers who found it useful, 
made it, and then put it up GPL.  Good luck and hope that helps!

Moreover, the latest relevant standard (RFC-2821) demands that the name
used in the EHLO or HELO command shall be the FQDN of the client, and not
even a CNAME.

Correct; what one has to remember is that for virtual hosting to work at
all, the client [browser] must be using HTTP/1.1; the older protocols do
not *require* that the GET (or other HTTP request) shall specify the
"Host:" header as one of the request packet lines.  Without any such
indication, the server will obviously serve up the content of the default
"virtual host".  This may, or may not, exist.

[My ISP, Demon Internet, at first implemented web hosting for their
customers by assigning each a unique IP address, although all those IP
addresses pointed to one and the same (cluster of) machines(s).  So
requests were discriminated from each other by the IP address to which
the client was connecting.  But when they first implemented this, they
DID announce that once a sufficiently large majority of connections were
using HTTP/1.1 rather than HTTP/1.0 (they never supported HTTP/0.9,
SFAIK) then they would be putting all the accounts onto a single IP
address and using v1.1 virtual hosting to discriminate between accounts.]

Message-ID: <3D1B73BC.8564.5B84B7@localhost>

What do I configure so that a script using cgi-bin resolves to the drive root 
- not the root of the web server.  Example.  I have a directory off of the 
root that is scripts (c:\scripts).  Both http://127.0.0.1/scripts and 
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/scripts (with different settings) resolve to 
c:\xitami\webroot\scripts !!  I can't get it to resolve to c:\

When I read the instructions, it looks like the default should resolve to the 
webroot, but if I use a differenct character it should drop cgi-bin and just 
resolve to the rest of the URL.  Am I going to need to move all my script 
directorys to the webroot?

Try XiFusion v2.6 (a Shining Light Productions product).  That allows you
to do both relative and absolute URL redirects.

Hope this helps!

Hey all, I found a great piece of software that will eliminate your =

Xitami Pro I can understand using that for, but the normal version of
Xitami has a version compiled for service use.  No point in using a wrapper
program to add a service when Xitami has native support for it.

Just a couple cents.

I'm running Xitami as a service on my NT box. I don't have a batch file starting the service.
Xitami even starts automatically on my Win98 development machine.

But I DO have a Shockwave EXE that runs as a service. 
For this I use www.Basta.Com.  Look at "AppToSvc" too.

Micro$oft do actually already have an app to do this without using 
third party software, if you should so need to do this for Xitami or 
something else...

Please see this article.

What? I thought XitamiPro is a native WinNT/2000
service application? I hope so -- I just paid for it a
couple of days ago but haven't had the chance to
set it up yet.

=== quote from readme file ===

    Open a console box and cd to the Xitami/Pro directory.  To install the
    Xitami/Pro service, type:

        xiprosrv -i

    To run it without installing it (nice for testing), type:

        xiprosrv -d

    To uninstall it, type:
    
        xiprosrv -u

    Finally, copy the xiprocpl.cpl control panel into your Windows system
    directory if you want interactive control of the service.
=== end quote ===

Sounds like a service app to me....

That link points to an article about "sc.exe", which
is for remotely configuring and controlling services.

But to make a regular app run as a service you need
something else, I believe.

The MS Windows NT and 2000 resource kits have
a utility called "srvany.exe" that will run many
regular apps as a service.

I had to use it to get Mercury Mail to run as a
service. Seems to be working okay so far.

Hello,

I'm interested to know what others are doing with Xitami to combat against
this outside attack:

/scripts/..%5c../winnt/system32/ cmd.exe
/scripts/..%5c../winnt/ system32/cmd.exe?/c+dir

and this:

/scripts/..%5c../httpodbc.dll

Shows up in my log files often. I'm assuming this is a NT vulnerability?
Since I'm not running NT it's a fruitless attack but am concerned about
other attacks I may encounter in the future and want to know if there is
built in precautions.

Thanks,

Rob

Those are attempts to attack a IIS server.
My logs are full of attempts of various nature.
I've never had a problem with someone getting through.
I would suggest a firewall. I use www.TinySoftware.com
Next ... make sure your NT machine is locked down.
A good book on NT security is O'Reilly
"Securing Windows NT/2000 Servers for the Internet"
ISBN 1-56592-768-0
It's a small but very thorough book that does the step by step and avoids
all the theory.
