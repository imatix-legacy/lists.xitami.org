hi,
try to change it in defaults.aut instead of xitami.aut.

i think xitami.cfg points to defaults.cfg (under [Server]), defaults.cfg 
points to defaults.aut (under [Security]) and defaults.aut should contain 
an entry like

[/Admin]
     cooluser="coolpassword"

where, you might guess it, _cooluser_ is the username and _coolpassword_ 
the ... i forgot that ;-)
peace,
tony

defaults.aut (or other file denoted in one of the too-many CFG
files) will over-ride xitami.aut

My xitami.aut has the "-" for admin password, yet I can get in with
my secret word, because I have this in defaults.aut:


#*END

[/admin]
    Admin=beetsugar
    Realm=Admin

[Private]
    Jacky=robusta


{obviously I'm not posting my real password!}

{I should probably remove the Private line some day...}

> to test CGI scripts locally.

I read your first post and it is not at all clear that your problem
has anything to do with admin password. However, if the admin isn't
working as it should, fix it. And remember that config files can
point to other config files until you get dizzy.

(Yes, indirect config is a very useful tool. But sometimes I end up
doing all the right things to the wrong file.)

There is a dedicated list for ProtoNova already set up.  Further discussion
should probably move there, if for no other reason to allow the discussions
to be archived in one location.

Then there are those of us who are crazy and are like me and go and write a
web server...  However, such people are few and far between and, besides,
being "normal" is relative anyway.  :P

Written from scratch.  For the record, I did not use any code from Xitami
or look at it during development.  I did use the specification on LRWP
found in Xitami to develop the LRWP remote module.  Since only the LRWP
specification was used and no source code, there should be no legal issues
(just in case iMatix was considering a lawsuit).  Currently only LRWP 1.0
is supported (via the LRWP remote module), but as I told the Sokrates team,
LRWP 2.0 support is only 5-10 additional lines of code and LRWP 2.0 should
be fully functional by ProtoNova v1.1.

>want to explain your decision to start something new rather than add 
>or improve the existing body of code.  Just for interest.  Also, is 
>your server open source, or closed?

ProtoNova is a closed source web server designed to accomplish several goals:

1)  Demonstrate that the Unified RFC Protocol is a viable communication
protocol to the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) and get it accepted
for standards track development.  This indirectly dealt with the CGI DoS
issue found in Xitami since CGIs are a side-effect of ProtoNova rather than
a part of it.
2)  Provide an alternative to Xitami users (as you already pointed out).
3)  Solidify the LibLink code base (the core library operating behind the
scenes...all application code is 100% portable once LibLink is ported to
another platform - LibLink is currently weighing in around 31,000+ lines of
very stable, modular C code).
4)  Simplify the application code base.  ProtoNova is only about 5000 lines
of C code in one easy to maintain file (each remote module is about 1000
lines of code).
5)  Create several new innovations such as database logs (instead of log
files).
6)  Simplify server configuration (uses a tree-style INI format).
7)  Introduce HTTP/1.1 compliance that supports chunked transfer-encoding.
8)  Provide basic clustering, load-balancing, and server farm support while
maintaining simplicity.
9)  Add SSL/TLS support.
10)  Create symbolic links for a server running in the Windows environment.
And many more...

When comparing ProtoNova to Xitami, it should be compared with Xitami/Pro.
Both have SSL/TLS support, a pricetag, and are closed source.  Xitami is
different in that it has none of those three major things in common with
ProtoNova or Xitami/Pro.

Basically, I performed an analysis of Xitami and determined that it would
be better to start from scratch than to modify the source due to the fact I
had so many changes I wanted to make.  A _VERY_ detailed Microsoft Excel
comparison chart of several different servers can be found in the ProtoNova
web server 'httproot\docs' directory (I can make this available if enough
people want to see it).

$35 for Standard Edition.  $75 for Enterprise Edition.  $300 for Custom
Edition.  All three editions are described in detail on the Shining Light
Productions website.

You have probably heard that "a fast nickel is better than a slow
dime"...I'm hoping to make an ultra-fast penny.

As to the issue of money, I really don't like to charge money for my
products.  However, when a product takes a long time to develop, I need to
get something back for it...*especially* if there is to be PFR support
(Priority Feature Requests - 24-72 hour turnaround times/product
releases/product updates - only Custom Edition users can issue PFRs) and FR
support (Feature Requests - usually 3-4 weeks, but can vary - owners of any
Edition can issue FRs).  Given that information, the product is practically
free.

Basically, as you can probably tell, the cost of the product is to just
cover support for it.  The fact it is so cheap is because of the
distribution system used (without the distribution system, it would be too
costly for end users for Shining Light Productions to even consider
developing it).  I'm not sure how iMatix distributes Xitami/Pro since I
haven't purchased it, but I would be interested in knowing how your system
works and I might be able to provide a few pointers to allow you to reduce
the price (or at least make it more cost-effective).

Personally, I think Xitami is still a very good web server and has
excellent potential to become really good, but as you said, time is lacking
to develop it and I also did not want to mess around with code that has
been in existence since 1991(? - at least iMatix has been around that
long).  I also needed to 

Also, I want you to know that you may mention/point users to the CertGen
Project for SSL certificate generation for Xitami/Pro.  I was probably not
very clear in my original e-mail, but certificates generated by the CertGen
Project will work with Xitami/Pro (https://www.2cah.com/ verifies this fact
- the public root certificate can be installed from
http://www.shininglightpro.com/index.php?treeloc=11), Apache (mod_ssl),
and, of course, ProtoNova.  It is a free service that I am providing
(except for Type 1 Authentication certificates) and simplifies the SSL
certificate generation process to filling in a form with information,
clicking 'submit', and downloading and extracting the generated certificate
set.  Having Xitami/Pro users use the CertGen Project will simplify both
your life and your users' lives.

Hope this helps!

So if you feel like that about such commercial advertising, why do you

see, the concept of trimming to only relevant material in postings isn't

Thanks for the information, which I think everyone on this list will 
appreciate reading.  Just for the record, the Xitami license 
agreement says that you can do just about anything you want with the 
source code.  It is not even GPL - you could use it in a closed-
source server without breaking the license.

The rest of this discussion probably belongs on xitami-dev but I'll 
post it here because the question came on this list.

Why not put Xitami on SourceForge?  This is a matter of judgement: in 
the many years that Xitami has been out in the wild, we have had a 
few contributions (such as Thomas J. Hruska's Xifusion, and LRWP), a 
fair number of bug fixes and code patches, and an incredible number 
of feature requests and bug reports.  But we have not seen anyone 
pick up the source code and propose useful improvements to its core 
design or basic functionality.  One possible reason is that Xitami 
uses a complex toolset: Libero, SFL, SMT, WSX,... the server is not 
something that you open up and say 'ah, I understand'.  Conclusion: I 
do not believe it would work well as a collaborative open source 
project.

More importantly for iMatix, Xitami represents strategic technology.  
This may make some people laugh, considering that Xitami is unstable 
in some situations, but I mean it seriously.  We use Xitami and the 
underlying technologies (SMT, etc.) very heavily in our work.  We are 
happy to make this available to the wide world, because we believe in 
spreading our technology around, but we want to keep control of what 
goes into our tools.

Some people have suggested, and I think this is a great idea, to 
simply upload the Xitami source code to SourceForge, and start a true 
collaborative development.  iMatix would give their blessing to such 
a project, though we would ask that such a project use a different 
name.  We would make one suggestion, though: to use the GPL instead 
of the current license.  We also plan to do this with future releases 
of our source code.

I hope this helps to clarify iMatix's position with respect to Xitami.

Pieter,

first of all let me express my deep respect and congratulations on a very 
good thingy you created.

Following let me point out the view of someone used to participate in 
collaborative development efforts where possible (where 'someone' is able 
to :-) ). This is meant to be a constructive contribution to the discussion 
even if words sometimes might sound very direct.

>Why not put Xitami on SourceForge?  This is a matter of judgement: in

In my opinion this is simply due to the somewhat unclear status of the 
special license under which xitami is distributed and the kind of weak 
position of imatix to xitami (verbatim as one 'can' understand it from the 
xitami homepage 'well it's opensource, but we're not quite sure, GPL or 
not, we'll further improve it or we won't ....).
So, some enthusiastic coder oder system designer considering working with 
the code, trying to improve or enhance this and that feature might come 
think that it it's way unclear what happens to his work if it's being 
submitted to the xitami crew or imatix. Will there be anyone to review it? 
Will it be reviewed in some faire amount of time? Is there any transparency 
as to what happens to a contribution? Will it be incorporated into the 
freeware version or into the pro version only (given its useful of course) ?
Last but not least, as can be seen on sourceforge for example, personal 
vanity of indivdual developers seems to play a role. Possibly people use it 
in their resumes, don't know. But such people should be encouraged by 
giving them credits (e.g. until recently I didn't know that LRWP for xitami 
was developped by a third party, namely Robin Dunn, whom I din't find to be 
acknowledged anywhere)

Well, complexity is quiet a relativ notion. Just want to name the Jakarta 
project. I think out there is great big bunch of talented people being able 
and willing to cope with complex developments.

Putting xitami on sourceforge and collaboratively develop it further would 
be a nice idea at first sight.
But i suspect just putting the code there and voilá wouldn't lead anywhere.
Even the open source community needs some kind of marketing and some kind 
of directives, namely
1) a leading authority driving and coordinating efforts - in the case of 
xitami  I can't think of anyone else but someone from the xitami team even 
if the os project runs under a different name
2) a vision (expressed as some slogan ...small 
footprint...performance....usability)
3) a differentiation to similar such efforts

surely no one can ask you people at imatix to take such a responsibility in 
an open source project like that but I personally would be very glad for 
you to be renowned as the ones being responsible for the development of the 
best-of-breed xxx-webserver and of course make profit of your name and 
service offers around the product (though not of the product itself).

Well, I wish xitami and their founders have a long and prosper future which 
way ever.

I was just notified that ColdFusion MX (CF MX) no longer has a file called
'cfml.exe' anywhere in the distribution.  This is a disasterous
announcement since Macromedia (the company that bought out/merged with
Allaire Corp.) has not opened the interface to ColdFusion MX.  I was
seriously considering opening XiFusion's source after a couple more
updates, but this notice was unexpected and untimely.

Here is what I am going to do to resolve this issue:

1)  Contact Macromedia and try to work with their developers to get
XiFusion to work with CF MX.
2)  If they will work with me, I will probably have to sign a
non-disclosure agreement.  This will effectively make XiFusion closed
source indefinitely.
3)  If I have to maintain XiFusion as closed source, I will port XiFusion
to every platform under the sun that CF MX and Xitami works under (as long
as I can get access to the hardware and software needed to compile and test
the programs).

There is a good chance that Macromedia will not support my efforts.  Those
of you considering a purchase of ColdFusion MX should weigh these issues
and take a serious look at Shining Light Productions' Nuclear Vision as a
viable alternative.

In the event that MM will not cooperate with me, I will just develop
XiFusion to the point that I was previously planning to develop it and at
that point decide if open sourcing it is a good idea.  In such an event,
XiFusion will work with CF 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0, but not CF MX.

As I told the person who notified me of this issue:
Cross your fingers, toes, wish me luck, and hope for the best...

Hope this helps!

Works great. With small hacks, serves RealAudio fine too.

Well... PHP. http://www.php.net
http://www.php.net/downloads.php

Then tell Xitami in Filters that files like ".PHP" should be fed
through C:/PHP4/PHP.EXE

Sometimes there is one more step, but I forget what or why. See what

I only get real informative messages from the list (besides lot of junk and
virusses, but there are coming directly to my mail account, not to the list).
The list is 100% clean.

This happened to me once... I discovered the spam had the headers of a
list I thought was secure because my mail was corrupted.

I've had no spam from this list in the short time I've been here.

You may want to concider a "spam filter".  I decided to use one and it 
was a good decision.  I get around 200-300 spam a day.  Yet I need to 
field messages from my online users.  My spam filter scans messages 
from the To, From, Subject, and Body.  It also has a "pass through" with 
domains I don't want to filter.  As I got spam I would added a phrase in 
my spam filter body scan to catch them.  Took me about a month to 
build up my word list (use phrases as short words my get a legit e-mail, 
"our customers, free viagra, xxx sluts, etc".  You will "almost" never get 
these in a legit e-mail).  Now dispite all the spam my regular e-mails 
come through and a spam may slip through once a week (getting 
promptly added to the filter).  

I have been on the Xitami list a few years now I believe.  I don't recall 
any spam from them (their address is unfiltered for me).

Message-ID: <3D4A6D2F.10243.5C3FD8@localhost>

  Ok need some serious advice folks. :)  I am adding CGI services to my 
web hosting.  I am rather new to CGI so I am not sure what will work 
best and thus could use some advice.  

My CGI server and webserver will be on two separate machines both 
running Xitami (I figure a DOS attack on the CGI will not bring down my 
web server then and the CGI process overhead won't lag the web 
pages ;).  My CGI server is a dual pentuim 90 running NT4 server, 
Xitami  and Zone Alarm.  

I really don't have deep pockets (I just run a fan art site with no 
advertising) so very low cost/GNU is important.  I would like to find a 
good CGI script to create "Forums"/message board for my users to 
discuss art. 

Anyone here with experience in what software would work best for me?  
I have heard that Active Perl is good and cygwin is helpful.  But again I 
am new to CGI.  Also if any of you can suggest a decent and free 
"message board" script that would be handy too.

Thanks again I can use all the advice I can get! ;)

Ewen reads this list, not in depth every day, but generally reacts
quickly when there is trouble. You note he stepped in when there was
question about announcing another product here. In the past, he has
acted quickly to suspend a member when they had an autoresponder
stuck in infinite loop.

Quite odd. I've been on the list continuously for over 2 years, and
can not recall one porno or hair-curl type spam that seemed in any
way connected.

> headings matching questions on the list

And yet, no spammer would think of subjects like the geeky things we
talk about here. So it does seem like someone is harvesting the list
(and too dumb to hide it); or that your email client is mixing
headers and bodies (I've seen that happen after a message with an
invalid header).

Have you tried the methods you were given? Mostly: look in the other
*.aut files for Admin sections.

And it is shockingly easy to move your webpages folder, delete the
whole Xitami directory structure, install a fresh copy, and move
your webpages folder back. I have done that when I thought I'd
mucked-up Xitami.

PHP, Perl, Nuclear Vision (wait, that costs $35...that's probably too much
for you, even though it is easier to use than PHP or Perl), CFExpress (the
full version of CF is something like $2000/$5000..._WAY_ out of your price
range), and anything you feel like writing (Borland offers their compiler
for free) are all low/no-cost options for CGI-based programming.

Personally, I've found the Perl scripting engine to be too slow (at least
compared with PHP and Nuclear Vision).  However, Perl does have some really
powerful built-in RegEx support...which comes in handy on occasion.

Message-ID: <853CE5E8344DD41198B900508BD6BC909632AE@DMNTEXCH>

 I host a couple small personal sites at home over DSL using Xitami and
ZoneEdit.  A few days ago there was something going on with my connection.
I could surf for a few minutes, then nothing could be found for a few
minutes.  Then it seemed to be just certain sites. (though not related to
sites stored in cache) That seems to have cleared up, but I still cannot
surf to the sites hosted on my computer, from anywhere.  I am assuming the
problems are related.  

I called the tech support company for my DSL provider and got exactly what I
expected.  I feel the blank stare coming from the other end o the line
through my phone.

Any ideas?

Thanks!

Subject: [Xitami] Quick CGI question
Message-ID: <004901c23a49$63dd0d10$9f00a8c0@ziggy>

I'm using Win32 executables as CGI apps. So far
all of the routines execute in a few milliseconds, but
I have some routines to develop that will take longer.

Does Xitami serialize CGI requests, or does it load
a separate instance of the CGI exe? And can the
server continue to process other web requests
while a CGI is executing?

For example: say I have a complex CGI routine that
takes 5 to 10 seconds to complete. 1 second after
a 1st user launches such a routine, a 2nd user does
the same. Does Xitami respond to the 2nd user
immediately and launch another of instance of the
CGI exe?

I suppose I could bang together a quick test and
see for myself, but it would help if someone could
provide a quick description of how Xitami handles
CGI processing.

Thanks!

On which note, spammers have recently (within the last six months)
started putting the characters "[]" into their subject lines (usually
with nothing inside the brackets).  The current theory as to WHY they've
started doing this is that the spammers had become aware that a lot of
"potential recipients" were using their usernames only for mailing list
traffic, and that they had suitable mail disposal filters defined such
that traffic with "[somelist]" in the subject line was automatically
routed to a "somelist" folder.  Spammers not wishing to have their
traffic ignored started putting in the brackets to work around such
filters.  (Happily, since they mostly have the null string inside the
brackets, this itself makes a fine filtering rule :-)

This is personal project and personal expense which is why I have to be careful how 
much I spend.  $25-$45 for example would NOT to much to spend for something that will 
be really useful to me.  But it is personal my funds so I don't want to rush out and buy 
software that I will never be able to use.  $1000-$5000 I think can be easily seen as 
WAY out of range for a little "hobby at home pc web page".  Again this is why I am 
asking for advice.

My main goal right now is to get a "standard compatible"/Perl CGI up and running for 
users and for programs we would like to run in the future.

You -may- find that this is slow. And rather than fret about
webserver theory, it may be better to find (or even buy) a P-400.

I have a super-simple notice-posting script on a P-150. Even via
modem, the delays while WinPerl starts up and thinks are noticeable.
For one user, no big deal. For hundreds, using a full-featured
script, even considering the low duty rate, you may want more CPU.

BTW, AFAIK all "P-90"s were really P-100 chips sold at a lower
price. Not that "overclocking" from 90 to 100 will knock your socks
off....

My *favorite* forum (user-interface as much as content) uses UBB.
Very simple for users, and apparently simple to administer. It runs
with Perl; though it seems there is also a port to PHP/MySQL.

I am not sure where it really comes from. These people sell it for
$199 and up:

The subject lines look exactly like the messages from the list. In fact, 
they were sent to me as if they were continuations of subjects I saw on 
real e-mails from the list.. I thought possibly there was someone else 
on the list responding directly to me with these ads, except that the 
return addresses are all from different list members. One of the 
messages actually was sent to me from my OWN address, according to the 
e-mail... Strange. I'd like to change mail clients to get rid of all the 
other spam I get anyway, but I'll have to go through every website I've 
done since '99 and change all the e-mail links to my new addy.
(Sigh)

Thanks for the input, though, guys.

Sounds like a good idea - what filter do you use, and where could I 
download it (if you don't mind my asking?)

I've tried following the instructions in the FAQ for both changing the 
admin password and for making a new account. Neither seem to work. I 
already have a valid password for myself, but in order to view the CGI 
I've been working on, my boss has installed Xitami and I've been trying 
to help HIM get a valid password set up. In the FAQ it mentions that 
during install you can make a username and password, but he says that 
the option never came up. I wouldn't really need him to get his own 
password, except that because I was still learning CGI when I started 
working on our current project, all my CGI files are stored in 
C:/Xitami/cgi-src instead of cgi-bin, so I need him to change the 
default CGI directory in his settings to be able to view them. I would 
re-program the cgi files to look for cgi-bin, except that there are a 
prohibitively large number of files in our project, and I'll already 
have to go through them all once and change that when the project is 
finished and we put it online.

So maybe I'm misinterpreting what the FAQ is telling me to do. As far as 
I can tell, I need to edit the xitami.aut file so that where it 
currently says "Admin=-" it changes to "Admin=mypassword." Is there a 
step somewhere I'm missing? Is there an alternate way to change it? Even 
after changing it and restarting the program (even restarting the 
computer) Xitami will not accept my password with the username "Admin." 
Of course, on my computer I have admin access anyway with a different 
name, but I need to get my employer's computer to accept a password.

do you run an antivirus on your pc? some virii (such as the new klez virus)
will use addresses it finds as the from line - so you may get a message that
appears to come from some one else. it could be something similar with the
subject line.

i've never gotten spam from this list either.

Xitami does not serialize CGI requests.  This is partially why there is a
DoS/DDoS issue with it.  However, Xitami will continue to process
additional requests while a CGI is executing.  Basically, Xitami will start
a CGI request if it receives one without considering the consequences of
starting another CGI.  Many people on this list have solved this problem by
moving CGIs to a separate machine in production environments (2 PCs running
Xitami...one with CGI capabilities, the other with CGIs disabled).  So, if
one machine gets DoS'ed, the other can continue handling normal requests.

Well, immediately is somewhat relative.  CGIs on any web server take a very
long time to start up in relation to just dumping a file onto a socket
connection.  Each CGI operates in separate instances of the application
being run.  This means that the process list in, say, Task Manager will
have a 'mycgi.exe' (or whatever it is called) for each instance of the CGI
that is running.

Hope this helps!

As others have noted, I haven't seen spam messages on the list; and I've
just checked my spam folder to see if any Xitami list messages have
turned up there (no).

When considering this, beware that the Klez virus picks "random" subject
lines and to/from addresses that it finds on: someone's hard drive, the
web, etc.  The Xitami list is archived on the web, so it's entirely
possible that it may have been found and used as a source of subject
lines.  (I've definitely had mail where the subject lines has been taken
from the Xitami documentation on the web.)

I suspect that some spammers have also started emulating the same
technique.

One thing that you can do to determine where the messages are most
likely to be coming from is do "view all headers" and look at the
"Received" lines to see which machines the mail has been through.

Messages that have been through the Xitami mailing list will mention
"sxpublic.nxrda.imatix.net" (the mailing list server machine) near the 
middle of the list of "Received" lines (about half to get to the mailing
list server, and half to get out to you).

If the messages in question do not mention sxpublic.nxrda.imatix.net
then they definitely didn't come from the mailing list, but are instead
someone "imitating" the look of the mailing list messages to try to get
past spam filters.

(If someone does want to filter on this, I'd suggest not filtering
on that exact machine, because it's possible it could change at some
point in the future.  But "imatix.net" should always be somewhere in
the Received headers.)

I do run Norton systemworks (which includes antivirus) but I'm pretty 
sure that Klez got past it before I downloaded the appropriate virus 
definition/cure. No matter how many times I run the antivirus program, I 
still get messages "returned" to me that I didn't send out with copies 
of the virus attached. The program can't locate the virus on my hard 
drive. Unfortunately, I have no way to back up the work files I need to 
keep, so I can't do a clean reinstall until I finish this project. And I 
can't finish the project until I can change Xitami's password. (Ah, the 
interconnectedness of all things.)
Klez would definitely explain why I'm the only one experiencing the spam 
problem on this list, though.

Thanks,
  Greg

Check the returned e-mails for the return path and this will tell you where
they originated.

The e-mails are being returned to sender but the sender has emulated your
e-mail address so they do not appear to come from the actual sender.

This will almost certainly be someone you know.

I asked if you tried the methods given _HERE_. You reply that you
used the info from the FAQ. If you ask for help, then disregard any
help offered, all is futile.

You have more problems than can be addressed here. NO ability to
backup is like being on the freeway without a seatbelt. And Norton
is not the only (and possibly not the best) virus tool. See this
page for other Klez info, including semi-manual removal and free
Java-based scanning.

Sorry to get touchy, but I'm running out of time, and my job is at the

Open defaults.aut.  At the top there should be a [/Admin] section:

[/Admin]
  username=password

Stop and restart the server (I don't think I've read that you have done
this after editing the files...a _VERY_ important step).

Try connecting to:  http://localhost/admin/

Hope this helps!

I think you can do that in Admin.aut.

Answered twice, days ago. I got these through the List (and in light
of other issues, I verified that they truly came from
sxpublic.nxrda.imatix.net).

Did you get and read these or not?

hi,
try to change it in defaults.aut instead of xitami.aut.

i think xitami.cfg points to defaults.cfg (under [Server]), defaults.cfg 
points to defaults.aut (under [Security]) and defaults.aut should contain 
an entry like

[/Admin]
     cooluser="coolpassword"

where, you might guess it, _cooluser_ is the username and _coolpassword_

files) will over-ride xitami.aut

My xitami.aut has the "-" for admin password, yet I can get in with
my secret word, because I have this in defaults.aut:

#*END

[/admin]
    Admin=beetsugar
    Realm=Admin

I read your first post and it is not at all clear that your problem
has anything to do with admin password. However, if the admin isn't
working as it should, fix it. And remember that config files can
point to other config files until you get dizzy.

Also two more answers since your latest plea.

Has anyone ever created a script of batch file to automagically creat a site

Okay,

I'm an absolutelute rookie, but this works. Don't try anything else.

I opened Default.aut and saw this

[/Admin]
    jbailey="CurrentPassword"

I changed it to read
[/Admin]
    jbailey="NewPassword"

I terminated Xitami and restarted it. Then I went 127.0.0.1/admin, typed my
new password and presto, It was honored. If that is ALL you want to know,
this should make you happy.

Ok let me spell it out for you, a batch file or script that when run will
create your website directory(s) and create the cfg and aut file for you (at
the command line)? I have been working on such script but wondered if I was
re-inventing the wheel. While sitting at the server I think it would speed
things up a bit when creating a site. If no one has done that I will share
with you what I come up with.

it is about generating a script which generates a config file for this
new virtual host and adds this host to the default.cfg

not a serious job for a programmer, especially when you shrinked down
the config files for each VHost.

i'm only using a small rexx file to create the directory structure
which our system needs and copy, paste & change the few lines needed
for each new domain with an editor.

the xitami admin console is a masterpiece of work but since i worked
with xitami before thit feature existed there are a lot of thinks in
the files which aren't compatible to the Admin console.

Here is my donation, Hope it comes over alright. I'm sure I don't have my
Xitami set up like most people but it is working flawlessly for me. When you
take a look at this create.bat file you will see that my Xitami runs on F:
and all my sites are in a sub-directory called websites. Also I'm probably
putting in extra stuff in my defaults.cfg file that isn't needed but again
it works for me. You do need to have QBasic in your path. I ended up just
putting it in the Xitami directory because that's the only place I'm using
it. This creates the xxxx.com directory or xxxx.net directory in the
websites directory, and 2 sub-directories (control and cgi-bin) in that
directory. It creates a new xxxx.cfg directory and copies a blank xxxx.aut
file. And I update the defaults.cfg file for the redirects to the xxxx.cfg,
which is the last thing in my defaults.cfg file.

If this works for anyone fine if not then don't use it. Of course feel free
to modify it to suit your needs then send me 1 million dollars. (JUST
KIDDING)

My last jab.
You guys need to light up. You are so hard on some of these folks to the
point of being down right mean. (just my two cents) Otherwise this is a very
good forum and I find most of the information I see very useful.

like xiconfig?

that pretty much does all you're talking about, and there's nothing to stop
you from tweaking it.

unless windows xitami isn't like POSIX xitami.

Subject: [Xitami] Overhead of GSL vs JSP vs CGI vs SSI?
Message-ID: <3D50E1CD.6090106@freesbee.fr>

This is particularly directed at the imatix people on the list

I am in the process of developing something where I have some 
semi-dynamic content and I'm wondering what is the best way to handle it.

Essentially the pages I wish my users to see have static decorative bits 
(layout stylesheets etc) common to all pages, a part which is created 
once and then stored and some other bits which may change on a daily 
basis. As I see it there are three number of ways to combine the static, 
semi-static and dynamic bits into one page and I wonder which is the 
best for a Xitami server?

As I see it these are my choices:
Firstly I can serve up the pages using an external CGI app
Secondly I can use GSL to combine various XML pages and static content
Thirdly I can use SSI.
Fourthly I can use LRWP and the Sokrates JSP stuff

SSI is probably the least flexible because I have to keep the formatting 
of the original page and there may be cases where I wish to redisplay 
the data a different way. On the other hand xitami's CGI handling is not 
exactly its best part so I'm leaning away from a pure CGI version as we 
move to production. I'm interested in JSP but Java in general is not the 
worlds best performer so that option is also not that promising. Finally 
therefore there is the GSL option where I can use an interpreted script 
to combine things.

It seems to me that GSL and SSI are implemented in a similar fashion by 
Xitami and thus - assuming the script is fairly clean and tidy - GSL 
should perform almost as well as SSI but allow for a lot more 
flexibility? Is this the case? and is this going to be faster than a 
(compiled) external CGI program? I think it should be because as I 
uderstand it the server does not have to load XIXSSI and XIXXML whereas 
it does have to load the external CGI app, but I'd appreciate 
confirmation. Also given that the required actions are pretty straight 
forward am I wrong to fear the JSP alternative? When I run the JSP it 
seems to take up a lot of memory compared to xitami (but thats Java for 
you) but is it goign to be slower too? It seems to be a lot more complex 
but maybe it isn't? Also I now that Xitami's SSI has a bug in terms of 
the maximum page size it will deliver, does GSL suffer from the same 
problem? The external GSLGEN.exe doesn't seem to.

Any help or thoughts appreciated

You -may- find that this is slow. And rather than fret about
webserver theory, it may be better to find (or even buy) a P-400.

I have a super-simple notice-posting script on a P-150. Even via
modem, the delays while WinPerl starts up and thinks are noticeable.
For one user, no big deal. For hundreds, using a full-featured
script, even considering the low duty rate, you may want more CPU.

BTW, AFAIK all "P-90"s were really P-100 chips sold at a lower
price. Not that "overclocking" from 90 to 100 will knock your socks
off....

My *favorite* forum (user-interface as much as content) uses UBB.
Very simple for users, and apparently simple to administer. It runs
with Perl; though it seems there is also a port to PHP/MySQL.

I am not sure where it really comes from. These people sell it for
$199 and up:

I have used WWWBoard from Matt's Script Archives successfully under BSD and
Linux.  It requires Perl to run.  It sets up a fairly nice little forum, and
you can customize it so that the forum interface is consistent with the rest
of your site.  Out of the box, it isn't moderated, but I think that can be
done with a little fiddling.

It is, of course, free (the price is certainly right), and you can find it
at:  http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts.  This is actually an older link I
haven't visited in some time; if it doesn't work for you, let me know
privately, and I'll e-mail it to you.

Hope this is useful!

Cheers,
David

I was thinking the same thing today, but having nothing to really say, I
did not e-mail anything.

However, the following page is some quite interesting reading for anyone
managing a website (I think I've seen this link somewhere before but

Message-ID: <1C4845821B46D511866600A0C96070B62B7609@srt-6.srtelecom.com>

Hi,

I am using Xitami in Windows NT 4.0 (2.4d9). I have a few scheduled
background
tasks running on my server that slows down Xitami so I changed the task 
priority of xiwin32.exe from 'low' to 'high'. When that is done, the 
background tasks does not slows down Xitami anymore and everything is fine. 
If I check immediately after, Task Manager report this task has having
'high'
priority.

Few hours after when I check again, Xitami has returned by itself to 'low' 
priority and I did not restarted it. It happens to me every time I switch
it.

Is there a way to change Xitami's priority and making sure it will stay
'high'?

Thank you!

we had similar (but not so harsh) attacks in the last 3 years.

you have only one chance: your ISP must filter. if the traffic hits
your router, you're lost.

thats why i'm usually don't use special firewall settings (only as NAT
gateway): we block some traffic at the ISPs side and others in our
router.

Connection problem

Hi

I have run a Xitami Webserver for some time w/o problem. But since some 
time no one from outside can connect to me.
Some facts:
Windows XP
Zone Alarm Pro 2.6.362
Xitami webserver 2.4.D6

I normaly connect via a .tk domain through  DNS2GO to my dynamic IP address .

I have tried following with  NO  success:

Shout down the firewall.
Connect through DNS2GO address
Connect to my IP directly.
Reinstalled Xitami web server
Reinstalled DNS2GO

If I run my web browser on my one PC there is no problem to see my website.
Nor from the .tk domains, DNS2GO or directly to my IP for the moment.
But if anyone else try they can't connect.

Can anyone help me?

Med vänlig hälsning/regards

I have had that happen on occasion.  It usually occurs when the FTP server
is used.  Try disabling FTP and see if the problems go away.  If they do,
get a commercial-grade FTP server if you need FTP capabilities.

If your TCP/IP stack crashes, then your whole system will die (BSOD).
TCP/IP is generally implemented within a Virtual Device Driver (VxD) or
System Device Driver (SYS) and if it crashes, the whole thing goes with it
because drivers run in Ring 0 along with the OS.  Applications run at Ring
3.  If Microsoft bothered to do everything correctly, drivers would run at
most Ring 1.

If your stack is messed up, then it might be time to re-install Windows or,
this is a long-shot, get a different network card with better drivers (I
recommend a good PCI 3Com card).  Good drivers makes for a more stable OS.
A generic network card comes with, probably, sloppy/poorly written drivers
and will tend to not work well.

Hope this helps!

Yes, this may be so.
I do on occasion have situations where TCP/IP communication dies ... for whatever reason.
System still lives though, sans any communication.

This happens on my Win98 machine (desktop). 
Instead of figuring out why, I reboot every now and then.

My Zone Alarm recently "upgraded" to the new Zone Alarm (don't 
remember version).  Despite the fact I added Xitami into the program 
wizard after the second reboot Zone Alarm ALWAYS blocked all access 
to Xitami no mater what I tried.  Forced me to switch to Norton if I 
wanted to use a firewall and Xitami.  Hope others had better 
experience.  This problem showed on my Windows NT box running 
Xitami 2.4d9 running very stable until the new zone alarm.

Well depending on what you need you may have better luck with a 
older more mature version of Xitami.  I tried one of the 2.5 versions but 
was having to many problems on the OS/2 platform using CGI so I 
switched back to 2.4d until things clear up (and then I'll enjoy of the 
nice new features of 2.5 :).  I am currently running 5 Xitami servers on 
separate IPs currently.

For windows NT 4.0 I am running 2 Xitami servers for some Windows 
ONLY web apps I wanted. 2.4d9 NT service seems very stable and has 
so far (crosses fingers) been running with little intervention.

My track record with 3 OS/2 servers running Xitami as my primary web 
servers.  Running up to Xitami 2.4 with no problems for years on the 
OS/2 servers.  My systems are two Pentium 100s and a 133 are rarely 
over %5 CPU utilization on a full upstream pipe.  OS/2 is my preferred 
platform for Xitami.  I have had some servers run for over a year and 
never even need so much as a reboot.  The perfect load and "no 
worries" web combo in my experience.  

I hope I can keep using OS/2-Xitami as my primary servers.  Who 
knows maybe in the future m$ will make things proprietary enough 
you'll need a licenced copy of windows just to use the net. :P

Talking about FireWalls - I used ZoneAlarm and experienced such 
problems, then I moved to Sygate Personal Firewall, which then wasn't 
very mature and took a lot of configuring, but now is a lot better and 
much more powerful.

The drawback - It's heavy. Now it takes 30 megs total (Phycival+Virtual) 
memory and I saw it get up to 40+.

I definetly recommend it for usage on servers.

Hi

I have run a Xitami Webserver for some time w/o problem. But since some 
time no one from outside can connect to me.
Some facts:
Windows XP
Zone Alarm Pro 2.6.362
Xitami webserver 2.4.D6

I normaly connect via a .tk domain through  DNS2GO to my dynamic IP address .

I have tried following with  NO  success:

Shout down the firewall.
Connect through DNS2GO address
Connect to my IP directly.
Reinstalled Xitami web server
Reinstalled DNS2GO

If I run my web browser on my one PC there is no problem to see my website.
Nor from the .tk domains, DNS2GO or directly to my IP for the moment.
But if anyone else try they can't connect.

Can anyone help me?

Never tried Sygate but I hear users like it.  Norton for me is actualy 
really nice, not a CPU/system hog, and fast to configure/update.  I'm 
always scraping by on pennies so I can't afford it on  every PC I own.  
Zone alarm is cheaper and I use it on my personal PC.  Shame it has 
problems with Xitami.

The latest Zone Alarm (3.1.xxx) appears not to work very well under W2K (my
personal experience was, it stank) and XP.  It hogged CPU cycles like there
was no tomorrow (up to 99% on my machine) and continually forgot the
settings; I suspect this may be why it wouldn't allow Xitami to connect. 
Also, in spite of what the Zonelabs online documentation said, apparently,
you should have completely uninstalled your old Zone Alarm before upgrading,
and _not_ imported any previous settings to the new version.  I understand
this helps performance somewhat (not enough, IMO).

If you like Zone Alarm (and I've been a fan for some time, using 2.6.xxx
releases), and haven't migrated to something else (Tiny, Sygate), do a
complete uninstall of 3.1.xxx (select "custom" instead of "automatic",
because "automatic" leaves registry keys, etc.), reboot, reinstall your old
Zone Alarm, reboot again, and you should be OK.

If you've gone to some other firewall, you should visit the Zonelabs site at
http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/support/znalmInstallFAQ.jsp for
instructions on how to do a full uninstall, since the old Zone Alarm
settings may interfere with your new firewall.

For more info on Zone Alarm and its problems, visit http://download.com.com
and do a search on "zone alarm"; I understand from reading the posts there
that people have had problems with both the free and premium 3.1.xxx
releases.

Hope this helps!

Subject: [Xitami] EU: OpenSSL Security Update
Message-ID: <3.0.6.32.20020814111107.009a00a0@mail.shininglightpro.com>

This EU (Emergency Update) is being released in relation to OpenSSL
courtesy of Shining Light Productions.

Affected Software:  ProtoNova v1.0-v1.1.  Xitami/Pro - all versions.
Apache (mod_ssl) - all versions.

Security Issues:  A buffer overrun in the distributed OpenSSL binaries can
enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the local machine.  Other
serious security issues are also present in 0.9.6f and lower.

Fix For Windows Users:  Install the Win32 OpenSSL project (0.9.6g) and
rename the old libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll files to libeay32b.dll and
ssleay32b.dll in the directory where the web server is installed.  Restart
the web server.  If the web server crashes complaining about one of the
OpenSSL DLLs, then rename the files back and wait for an official fix for
the web server.  If local, state, or country laws affect the default build
of OpenSSL, then OpenSSL will have to be built from the ground up.

Alternative Fix:  Download the source code to OpenSSL 0.9.6g from
<http://www.openssl.org/source/> and build it from the ground up.  Takes
approximately 5-30 minutes to build depending on hardware capabilities and
software installed.

Additional Notes:  The Win32 OpenSSL project can be found here:

Message-ID: <003701c243e0$b360dc40$0100a8c0@celeron2k>

Hi,

	I'd like to FTP files to the server where Xitami is, but using a secure
connection. So, I want to FTP via an SSH tunnel, so that I can use a regular FTP
program and still benefit from encryption. So far so good.

	Problem is, I am not root on the remote machine (which does not run an FTP
server), so I'd need a simple FTP server that takes connections from localhost
only and can be installed on non-standard FTP ports. I'd then launch it form a
console, do teh file transfers, and then exit it.

	Any ideas ?

	thanks,

marcio

uh... we had a discussion about ProtoNova (2002/07/31), an announcement

Then complain to them: perhaps they've put into place an "over-
aggressive" spam filter that is mistakenly filtering out posts to the
list.  (Many ISPs are so incompetent as to do this: witness the AOL and
the Harvard course acceptances.)

FYI, since 1st August, I have filed a total of 80 messages to the xitami
mailing list (and that was whilst discarding those which were "just
conducting a test").

You missed yesterday's (08/14/2002) security issue dealing with Xitami/Pro
and basically anything using OpenSSL (ProtoNova is mentioned, but Apache is
also vulnerable).

For those who missed the message, there are 4-6 very serious security
issues (all documented somewhere on bugtraq) and anything from 0.9.6f and
lower is vulnerable to some sort of DoS/DDoS/Buffer Overflow attack.
Anyone running Xitami/Pro *MUST* upgrade their OpenSSL libraries to avoid a
hostile takeover and/or DoS.

I forgot to mention that this affects ALL users of Xitami/Pro (not just
Windows users).

Hope this helps!

Message-ID: <3D5C476F.6697.831F535@localhost>

Well I tried the e-mail in the program and it bounces.  I'm hoping someone here can help 
me in their experience with (mailto.zip) off the Xitami add on page?  If not that's ok as I 
know it's a long shot.  But hopefuly someone may know something?  

I downloaded the util mailto.zip off the xitami web page and was trying to get it running 
as a CGI app. First off mailto works just fine from the command line perfectly.  I have 
sent several e-mails using the command line already.  The problem is when I try to use it 
as a CGI I get "Mail failed to send.  Error on connect."  

I have spent two days trying to use the example programs and I think perhaps I am 
missing something?  I have callmailto.html uploaded to the webpages directory.  The 
other files uploaded to the cgi-bin directory.  mailto.exe loads the sendmail.html and 
register.html .  But when I get send I get the error.

Bellow is a minimal alteration to the mailto.cfg file with the settings that worked on the 
command line.  

[MAILTO]

Messages SHOULD be going to your HotMail mailbox. Look to see if
HotMail has "spam filters" which may assume that list-mail is often
spam. This may be a user-option, or it may be that HotMail is tired
of being a dumping ground for the world's spam. If you have a more
conventional email box, subscribe with that.

Are you getting a message from the Xitami list administrator around
the first day of each month, reminding you of how to access your
list settings?

Yes, HotMail has a *Junk Mail* filter (in options), that can be set
to OFF, LOW, HIGH or EXCLUSIVE. The HIGH setting will
occasionally identify wanted email as junk. There is a separate
setting, *Junk Mail Deletion" which can be set to either
IMMEDIATE or DELAYED (which gives you 7 days to check
your Junk folder for any wanted email). So when set to High
and Immediate there's a good chance one would never see
any xitami list posts.

The easiest way to keep the Junk Filter in place, but get mail
from known sources is to add it to the *Safe List* -- just put
xitami.org there and it will not filter Xitami List messages.

What exactly are you trying to accomplish with Xitami and MySQL?  If you
want to do script-based stuff, try Nuclear Vision, PHP, ColdFusion, Perl,
or a number of others.  If you want to do something like database logs,
Xitami doesn't have that type of support.  You will have better luck with
Apache or ProtoNova or some other such server (IIS, maybe via ISAPI?).

If you clarify your intentions, then this list can help you out much
better.  A web server generally doesn't magically just know how to talk to
a database.

Hope this helps!

Ok i want to use PHP to connect to the MySQL server to read a database that

and that runs fine. I have a PHP script that was wrote to use a MySQL
database but when i try to connect i get the error: MySQL Connection Failed:
Can't create TCP/IP socket (10106).

You need to install MySQL as a service (just installing the software isn't
enough).  From the command line under NT (default install):

C:\>_
C:\>cd\mysql\bin

C:\mysql\bin>mysqld-nt --install
...Something about installing as a service...

C:\mysql\bin>_

Then try the PHP script again.  Note that this is an off-topic issue and
the request should have been placed elsewhere (hence the reason for the
initial confusion).

If you are running under 95/98/Me, then there is some way to run it in the
background, but I've never done it.

Hope this helps!

Is this not more ot do with your net connection or IP? I've had people resume 
from my Xitami server with no problem, or so I'm told.

I am not sure.  I have been told before the web server doesn't support resuming.  But 
perhaps it is from errors users are getting?  I'm hoping someone may know why these 
errors are occurring and if there is a Xitami setting to correct this?

  I'm sorry for just now responding to your reply.  Hopefully, I will soon 
be able to work the list properly~

  niall,

  I'm not sure what the robots.txt is, but I'm running a chronic pain 
support group to help sufferers find doctors not afraid to use narcotics to 
control pain, it's http://www.sorcep.com ; Sorce-P

  I still can't figure out why it will not list ANYWHERE?   At this point, I

  Hello all,

  I am having problems getting my site listed in the major search engines.
Even with free sites like Geocities, I was able to at least be listed in
Google.  Is it because the search engines look at sites hosted on your own
computer (with Xitami), differently than sites hosted in other ways?  Any
help or advice would be appreciated!  I have gone to great lengths to
compile meta tags, and title indexes.  I know of people who don't even use
meta tags, or go to any effort to list their sites, yet they are listed way
up in them, and it has just gotten frustrating to me.. Thank and I hope
everyone is doing well!  have a good day.

  PS:  Would someone send (to my email address), the exact link that I need
to use to come read, and post to this list online, without reading and
posting through my email service?  I "just" now realized that I do not get
many posts to my email, like other lists!  Only very few actually come
there!  Thanks all!

   John - {dummy}

  Is there a way to set up separate u/names and p/words for different

have it so that the u/name and p/word for one, will "NOT" work on the other?

o, definitely.

you can already see this in action if you're using xitami for a
POSIX-compliant system (i can't speak for windows).  /admin/ is a separate
folder from /private/ but both are username/password-protected.  UNIX/BeOS
users would see this in defaults.aut - 

[/admin]
    adminUsername = "password"

[PrivateDirectory1]
    guestUsername = "password"

[PrivateDirectory2]
    guestUsername2 = "password2"
    guestUsername3 = "password3"
    guestUsername4 = "password4"



you can go on with this forever.  all of them should be editable from the
adminisrative webpage (but i dunno if you can actually create the dir from
the admin page).  hope this helps.


robots.txt is a file that tells webspiders not to catalogue your site for
search engines like google, yahoo, et cetera.  it looks like that's not on
your site, so i'm not sure what to tell you.  when i don't use it, google
spiders the hell out of me.

Hi

I have now uninstalled Za and replaced it with Tiny Personal Firewall. But

Hi
I might have missed it, But how do you connect to the Internet. ?
When you do a service scan with your dns2go name  @
http://domainwhitepages.com/  what are the results.

	Have you tried a packet sniffer ? You can see what is going on, and easily
diagnose the problem.

That's not the IP I see for that hostname:

amenti> host h214n2fls33o846.telia.com
h214n2fls33o846.telia.com has address 217.208.109.214

Also it has an odd error when I try to ping it:

And when I ping the IP that you think you are, no go:

Is an update going to be released for Xitami/Pro? Or is there
some way to patch this ourselves? The fix described above
does not seem to apply to Xitami/Pro -- I cannot find any of
the files listed in the xitami directory, or anywhere on the

Hi

Thanks all for Your help.

The problem was as follows.

An installation of a game cased some problem to my OS (win XP).
I then repaird the OS be installing it again over my previus.
As a default the XP firewall is enabled, something I did't realised.

After disableing the XP firewall everything was OK

Sounds like you don't have ActivePerl installed.

http://www.activestate.com/

You'll probly have to download a 2 meg generic installer unless you have 
Win2k or WinXP.
Then you'll have to download the actual Perl package (8-16 megs).

If it is downloading you may have your cgi your "webpages" directory which is incorrect.  
Under the Xitami directory make a folder called "cgi-bin" and put your cgi files/s there.  
Then install Active Perl.  When you call your cgi from a web browser it should look like 
this:  http://yourdomainname-or-yourip-address/cgi-bin/your.cgi  Follow those steps and 
it should work.  If you want to make certain you can go into your Xitami Admin setup and 
make shure CGI is enabled (I think regular non SSI is enabled).  

As far as other users laughing at you.  I have never never seen anyone be rude here.  
Though sometimes it can be hard to get a responce.

1) For free DNS service try www.granitecanyon.com.
2) www.gandi.net - A registrar that offers free DNS for their clients.
3) There is Bind for NT, I don't know how good it is, but you can try it 
(And tell me. :) )

Hope I helped! :)

If you want a quick and easy fix having someone else host (you would run a little 
windows update program) I have heard DNS2GO is good.  Myself I use 
www.dyndns.org.  Also some registrars like Joker offer free DNS services.

dito... zoneedit in tandem with directupdate.com (an app that tells zoneedit
when the cable guys change my IP address, which, btw, has not happened in 6
months). Both are freefreefree.

This question get's asked alot, and gives us hobbiest guys something to
chime in about, but should be posted to a xitami FAQ or something.

Good luck, and have fun.

You are absolutely right about this.  It appears that the Xitami/Pro server
is statically linked with SSLeay - an ancient OpenSSL implementation -
v0.9.0 to be exact (according to the hex dump I have before me).  There is
no way to patch this yourself.  iMatix should dynamically bind this library
for future releases of their SSL-capable server.

I'm sorry that I can't help you beyond this, but it is now imperative that
iMatix get a fix out for the problem ASAP as well as dynamically linking to
OpenSSL to avoid future hassles.  If you want to read more about it, you
can find the Security Advisory here:

<http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20020730.txt>

Note that it says that SSLeay is "probably also affected."  I would
consider anyone running an unpatched/unfixed production server to be
walking in dangerous territory and should take down any production
Xitami/Pro servers until iMatix fixes this.  It was serious enough to
generate a panic attack across the entire _world_ and generated THREE
different OpenSSL releases (two occured within 24 hours of each other) to
finally fix the problems.  0.9.6g is the latest, stable release.

Exploits exist for one of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities, but the code
is claimed to be "unreleased."  The fact that such code exists should send
everyone into hiding.  I suspect that in the next couple months we will see
unpatched/unfixed servers being changed remotely via malicious scripts.

iMatix, what is the status on this issue?

Hope this helps!

I've used BIND on Windows NT and even Windows 98. Setup was 
somewhat involved, but it worked better than the DNS Server that 
comes with NT. One reason I tried it was that we had customers 
who couldn't access certain websites, yet they could when 
connecting to another ISP. Turns out it was a combination of poorly 
set up DNS zones and the poor operation of NT's queries. 
Apparently it wouldn't query secondary name servers like BIND 
would. I can tell you, however, that there is a distribution of BIND 
for Windows NT.

Message-ID: <000101c24922$a8591000$0100a8c0@celeron2k>

Hi,

	I am trying to run a specific CGI program which needs a specific environment
variable. This variable is set, and I can see it if I go to the shell.

	Problem is, Xitami is not passing the variable to the CGI script. I tested it
by using phpinfo.php, like this:

<html><header><title>PHP Info</title></header>
<?phpinfo()?>
</body></html>


	Anyway, some vars are passed, others are not. I run Xitami as a service.

	I went to teh environment vars in WIndoes 2000 and made sure teh var is defined
system-wide, and not just for my user (because Xitami runs as a service). Still
no good.


	Maybe I have too many env vars and they are being truncated perhaps ?

	Any ideas ?

	Thanks,

marcio

	Got it.

	After moving the environment variable from user-specific to system-wide I had
to stop/start the Xitami service (had done that) *and* make sure the browser was
not showing me the old cached result from a previous run of phpinfo.php (had not
done that).

DOS and pretty-DOS (Win9x) can do that. There are ways to specify a
larger environment.

NT (including W2K and XP) have an essentially infinite environment.

Message-ID: <3D64CA07.27743.56453A5@localhost>

Ok this is getting rather bad.  I have posted about 5 questions and have got no 
responses.  I have written Xitami help after waiting a couple weeks here for a response 
first and got no reply there either.  If anyone has any information someone PLEASE help 
if you know anything?

First Mozilla reports Xitami web server doesn't support resuming.  Does anyone know 
why this error is reported and is there a setting in Xitami for this?

Second my Xitami used to almost never crash (2.4d7 for OS/2).  I have a cmd file to loop 
it.  But recently it has been crashing several times a day.  The more vhosts I add the 
more often it seems to crash.  My fan art server has grown recently and there is about 
40 virtual hosts now defined.  Sometimes a user accesses a directory or even I look at a 
virtual domain from my browser and Xitami drops it's core and reloads.  I can try to 
access the same vhost  3 times in a row and it will drop it's core three times and then 
perhaps on the forth work just fine (for a while).

My memtrace.list is here:  http://www.dragoncity.net/memtrace.lst  Some common errors 
are:

smthttp.c  (1052)  [0x3fa020]
sflsymb.c (561)    [0x1a7da0]

The web server is running on a Pentium 100 with a intel TX (I think) chipset.  My original 
reasoning to leave it on my pentium 100 was that CGI was being run on a different 
machine.  My pemtium almost never goes over 8% CPU usage and the Pentium seems 
(to me) to be very stable.  However it seems to me the more apps that are running the 
more often Xitami is to crash.  However "only" Xitami crashes everything else runs fine.  
Again it is not speed I am woried about.  I have a K6-2 550 system I can put Xitami on if 
needed.  The reason it's on the Pentium is it seemed very stable and it seemed to run 
Xitami as quick as my faster boxes.  Would a newer version of Xitami help?  Would a 
faster system help?

Any insight to this problem would be greatly appreciated as I badly need to get my 
Xitami server stable again.

  Thanks!  Gene Angel

Xitami reports itself as HTTP 1.0. Resume was not an HTTP feature
until 1.1. Xitami actually does support many HTTP 1.1 features. I do
not know if Resume is one of them.

> Second my Xitami used to almost never crash

What operating system??? How much RAM you got in that box?

I have several dozen v-hosts running on a P-150 with 32Megs under
NT4. Except the FTP service, it never falls down. Including rare
large FTP sessions, it goes down maybe 4 times a year.

So I would wonder about your O/S, corrosion on RAM sockets, drive
volume corruption, or using the Xitami FTP service (which is
admitted to be lightweight and known to crash).

Recent releases of Win-Apache are actually quite good. I ended up
having to use it to work-around a stupid bug in an otherwise
excellent script (later I did find the Xitami fix but it was not
worth taking the machine down to dump Apache). Apache still has that
monster config file instead of the sweet GUI in Xitami; otherwise I
think modern Apache may be the better tool for heavier sites. Xitami
is still faster, but that is not an issue even with your load on a
P-100.

I got this reply.  As far as your other questions on the previous post.  I 
am running OS/2 4.0 (fixpack 15 I think).  I am running Xitami for OS/2 
2.4d7 on a pentium 100 with 64mb of EDO ram (on this machine). Sys 
info reports 32.2 megs ram free after everything is loaded.  I have hard 
of the FTP in Xitami being lightweight and run a external FTP with the 
Xitami FTP server turned off.

Hi,
I have just downloaded xitami and ActivePerl5.6.1.
I am hoping to be able to set up my website on my local computer
(running win2000) to try to get a message-board script working and
to change the HTML templates without having to go online all the
time to see if my changes work (which is very slow, expensive and time
consuming editing the files remotely or uploading all the time).

I am fairly intelligent, and not scared of computers or reading alot
of material, but I have not done anything like this before.

Before I waste 40 hours of messing about and ending up no better off
than when I started, can anyone tell me whether Xitami is capable of
supporting CGI/Perl scripts on a Windows machine, and also whether
trying to get Perl to work on my computer is a realistic goal for
someone who is not a computer expert or a system administrator.
Cheers.

Well I was using... 2.4d7 I think on Windows. Thought that mahcine has 
since died and I'm using Linux and apache exclusively now. So I can't 
check my settings.

As was said in another respose I think it's the version of http used 
1.1. where resume is enabled.

Thanks everyone for the info and responses.  I have upgraded my server to the OS/2 
2.5 beta 5 now.  Perhaps that will let me know if it's a hardware or software glitch.  I 
would of thought the 2.5 would of been slower being it's a larger program and seems to 
use more memory.  But it without a doubt "feels" much faster over the local LAN (faster 
response to page loads from the browser).

Thanks! How easy is it though? This morning I have started reading
about environment variables, as one of the scripts I tested asked for
the PATH_TRANSLATED to be set properly... I have no idea at the moment
what that means, but I'm working on it. But I have a feeling that after
environment variables, it will be a hundred other things I have to do,
each one taking me many hours of figuring-out, reading, testing, etc.
Is this assumption right, or once I've done the environment variables,
is that more or less it do you think?

Well aside from some of the improvements I've seen.  I've run into a problem with the 
new beta.  In order to keep the web server I have a batch-cmd file that looks like this:

:xitami-start
reloadc <--- Just a reload counter.
xitami
goto xitami-start

In the past if Xitami crashed it would just reload and keep going.  After Xitami 2.5 is 
installed when it crashes it brings up a PM window (The application has encountered a 
problem and cannot continue. Press "OK").  Xitami will not reload untill you click the 
"OK" button with your mouse.

Is there a setting that will allow it to "not" wait for a mouse click of "OK" and just report 
the error to the console so it will reload?

Thanks Gene

Thanks! How easy is it though? This morning I have started reading
about environment variables, as one of the scripts I tested asked for
the PATH_TRANSLATED to be set properly... I have no idea at the moment
what that means, but I'm working on it. But I have a feeling that after
environment variables, it will be a hundred other things I have to do,
each one taking me many hours of figuring-out, reading, testing, etc.
Is this assumption right, or once I've done the environment variables,
is that more or less it do you think?

Don't look for problems until they bite you. Xitami generally sets
PATH_TRANSLATED to a workable value before calling the script.

Install Xitami. Open http://localhost in a browser on the same
machine and see if you see "Welcome To Xitami". Open
http://localhost/admin, give the secret word you gave when you
installed Xitami, and look at the many options. Under Configuration,
CGI, be sure "CGI Enabled?" is checked. Save back to main Admin
screen. Under Configuration, MIME, add an entry saying that ".pl" is
"text/html". Save back to main Admin screen.

Install Perl.

Create a folder C:\Xitami\cgi-bin

Unpack your script there. Figure out which file is the main script,
probably with a "/pl" extension. Let us say it is yak.pl

Wait a second. ShoppingCart and MessageBoard scripts are maybe the
WORST things to start with. First we will just see if Perl works.

Use NotePad to create a file C:\Xitami\cgi-bin\hello.txt The
contents of that file should be:

#! /fee/foo/perl
print "Hello, world!";

Save it, close NotePad, rename the file to "hello.pl", ignoring
Windows whining about changing file extensions. (Uh, you really
should not have Windows "hiding known file extensions"; that is one
of Gates' dumbest ideas.)

Reboot Windows. There are ways to avoid this, but I think it is best
when the server isn't in 24/7 heavy duty. Rebooting picks up some
changes to PATH that Perl added. You can add them manually for one
boot, but Perl sets it up to be set on every boot, and you may as
well find out if it worked.

Open a browser to http://localhost/cgi-bin/hello.pl If all is well,
you should see "Hello, world!" If not, write back with exactly what
happens.

With the simple Hello Perl program working, try
http://localhost/cgi-bin/yak.pl Maybe it works, maybe it starts in a
SetUp mode, and maybe it chokes. Write back if it fails, and say
exactly what happens and which script you are using with a link to a
website where you got it.

in config.sys search & update or append this command(s):

AUTOFAIL=YES

will write the error into c:\popuplog.os2

depending on your warp version you may need to add

SUPPRESSPOPUPS=C (C is a drive letter)

also.

a good idea is to add 

REIPL=ON

also. instead of displaying the trap screen and hang the machine will
reboot now.

you have to reboot after you change the config.sys

Well, for it to work in a web browser, this should be:

-------------------------------------
#!/fee/foo/perl

print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "Hello, world!";

Hope this helps!

Visual Basic has a function to set the errorlevel = 0.
This removes any previous errors reports in the VB kernel.

Prevoiusly, it was stated on this list that Valentina error
goes to 0 on the next success.

I would like if Valentina offered a set error = 0 also.

Valentina currently keeps the last error, and this is ok.
But the only way to get rid of the error message is for
success on the next command. 

set error = 0 , if implemented in Valentina, should clear
all errors from the kernel.

Thanks.

Unfortunately, due to the way SSL works, this is practically impossible.
VHosts are only accessible after the server certificate is sent to the
client.  For that reason, the only way to select certs. is based on IP
address.  You will have to get another IP address into Xitami to make it
work.  Another solution is to get a wildcard cert.  It is less secure, but
will allow you to make multiple VHosts under a top-level domain work with
just one cert.

To see an example of a wildcard cert., Shining Light Productions
(www.shininglightpro.com) issues 2cah.com a wildcard cert. every 395 days.
2cah.com is the primary host for Shining Light Productions.  A wildcard of
*.PrimaryDomain.com will allow you to use SubDomain.PrimaryDomain.com, but
not Whatever.Subdomain.PrimaryDomain.com.  Read up on the specifications
for SSL and HTTPS for more details on this.

You are, unfortunately, hitting one of the major limitations of the SSL/TLS
protocols and the difficulty you are having with configuring Xitami is not
iMatix's fault, but rather the weak protocol definition for multiple server
certificate selection AND the generic interface that OpenSSL/SSLeay provides.

Your best bet on a single IP address is to provide wildcard cert. VHosting.

Hope this helps!

Recently I downloaded & installed Xitami Webserver on my Linux =
2.4.19/KDE 3.0 (reiserFS) machine.
I am trying out CGI scripts but always get :

Error 500 : internal error=20
can not create CGI process - program not found.

My setup is as follows:
HTML dir : /mnt/hdc1/webpages
Cgi-bin dir : /mnt/hdc1/cgi-bin
(Both directories on WIN95 (vfat) partitions)

My web pages are getting loaded perfectly. But CGI scripts gives error =
500.
Xitami documentation/FAQ says that error 500 is mostly because of wrong =
header or syntax error.

Following is the script "server_info.cgi" in cgi-bin directory, I am =
trying to execute:
#----------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use CGI;

print <<END_OF_HTML;
Content-type: text/html

#-----------------------------------------------

I have perl 5.7.0 (perl+base+devel+.....many more libs) installed on my =
system and /usr/bin is where perl can be found.
I have enabled CGI and SSI on my server and made my scripts executable =
using chmod.

I could compiled my script using
#perl -wcT server_info.cgi
which gave "syntax OK" message.

The so called magic first line "#!perl" also does not work. It simply =
lists the contents of the file.
I tried to rename the script with .pl extension to overcome the problem =
but with no result.
Also tried to set filters for .cgi and .pl extensions with perl but that =
too did not work.

Xitami's "testcgi?" programs work OK, but they all seem to be C =
programs, not perl scripts.

Do I have to install any other perl libs specific to CGI on my system or =
I have missed out any settings?
I would appreciate If anybody can help me out in getting started with =
CGI.

Thanks & Regards,

Thanks for your detailed emails.

OK, so I don't think that's happened/happening correctly.
But, let's back-up a bit first. This is what I've done so
far (in the order I did it):

Installed ActivePerl_5.6.1 in c:\perl
Installed Xitami in c:\archivos de programa\xitami

(One of the main problems I am trying to deal with is that I have
recently emigrated to Spain and so the OS is in Spanish; I only
understand English. Also, Win2000 is completely new to me anyway,
having upgraded from Win95).

In Xitami, I defined the following:
Main HTML directory = c:/website
Main CGI directory = c:/website/cgi-bin
CGI URLs start with = /cgi-bin
.pl extension MIME-type = text/html.
I haven't made any other changes to Xitami.

I have successfully tested this script...

#!/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "Hello, world!";

However, this works whatever shebang I use, even if I purposely
write a totally incorrect one. I don't know if this is a good or a bad
thing (?). Also, I don't know if the above shebang is correct?

Next I tried to install my message board script. I have successfully
done this before on my domain-host's server.
I am using a variation of Matt's wwwboard script, revamped as
'Talkshop', from www.spiceisle.com/talkshop

There is an Administration/set-up script which
unpacks the rest of the package after confirming some directory paths
using an HTML interface.
However, I don't get as far as being able to define directories or
unpack the scripts. The Admin script tells me that "The value for the
PATH_TRANSLATED environment variable [c:/website] is incorrect. Please
enter the correct value below".
I've tried entering many different directory paths, but all are
rejected, and I get the same message each time.
Having read about fifty pages on the Internet about PATH_TRANSLATED,
I am none the wiser about how to set it, or what it should be! All the
reading material is Sys Admin stuff, and way over my head.

Thanks again for your help.

OK. Got it working through Localhost setup using /home/cgi-bin path.

But what I want to do is, point the localhost to my actual =
/mnt/hdc1/webpages and /mnt/hdc1/cgi-bin directory and access cgi =
scripts under it.

I tried it by defining "127.0.0.1    hexa-tech.localnet    hexa-tech" =
entry in /etc/hosts file, and
under Xitami Web-Admin, Defaults:Vhosts, I defined "127.0.0.1    =
hexa-tech.cfg". Also generated hexa-tech.cfg giving all the required =
paths for webpages and cgi-bin.

This setup correctly accesses my webpage directory, but fails to execute =
CGI scripts from /mnt/hdc1/cg-bin giving the error 500 as explained =
before.

Is it possible to set up such a scenario? If yes, how? Please advice.

Thanks & Regards,
Rajesh Deshpande.

  Recently I downloaded & installed Xitami Webserver on my Linux =
2.4.19/KDE 3.0 (reiserFS) machine.
  I am trying out CGI scripts but always get :

  Error 500 : internal error=20
  can not create CGI process - program not found.

  My setup is as follows:
  HTML dir : /mnt/hdc1/webpages
  Cgi-bin dir : /mnt/hdc1/cgi-bin
  (Both directories on WIN95 (vfat) partitions)

  My web pages are getting loaded perfectly. But CGI scripts gives error =
500.
  Xitami documentation/FAQ says that error 500 is mostly because of =
wrong header or syntax error.

  Following is the script "server_info.cgi" in cgi-bin directory, I am =
trying to execute:
  #----------------------------------------------
  #!/usr/bin/perl

  use strict;
  use CGI;

  I have perl 5.7.0 (perl+base+devel+.....many more libs) installed on =
my system and /usr/bin is where perl can be found.
  I have enabled CGI and SSI on my server and made my scripts executable =
using chmod.

  I could compiled my script using
  #perl -wcT server_info.cgi
  which gave "syntax OK" message.

  The so called magic first line "#!perl" also does not work. It simply =
lists the contents of the file.
  I tried to rename the script with .pl extension to overcome the =
problem but with no result.
  Also tried to set filters for .cgi and .pl extensions with perl but =
that too did not work.

  Xitami's "testcgi?" programs work OK, but they all seem to be C =
programs, not perl scripts.

  Do I have to install any other perl libs specific to CGI on my system =
or I have missed out any settings?
  I would appreciate If anybody can help me out in getting started with =
CGI.

  Thanks & Regards,
  Rajesh Deshpande.

i get this from time to time when the machine has to bear some extra
load.

no idea how to fix this because its probably a race condition
somewhere.

simply put Xitami in a batch and run in an endless loop.

I have been noticing.  If I am running any program (especially my net in/out monitor) 
other than Xitami it increases the chances of a crash 10 fold.  Also when another server 
is accessing (backing up) the web directories over the lan it crashes a lot.  Would a 
faster processor help with the crashes or would any load likely set it off?

this is very strange because this error occurs on high http traffic
only.

are you sure that you're on the latest fixpacks ?

I'm on Fixpack 15 the last before software choice.  My net connection is a 768 SDSL.  
However the internal network here at home can access the site at 100mbps.  I do run 
FTP Server .94.  It seems to have no problems at any time.  Lately my servers hit rate 
has jumped.  But it is  clearly more a problem if other things are running/accessing the 
net.  

I download SMBAR31 from hobbes to watch my net usage (very handy util) and had to 
stop using it as Xitami crashed much more often (average twice per 12 hours).

If this helps figure things out here is my current config after swapping out all my 
memory.  My primary web server is now running OS/2 4.0 FP15 with Xitami, and FTP 
Server.  The system has 32 megs (my other simms were smaller) of RAM, Realtek 
10/100 (latest OS/2 drivers).  There are two hard drives 2.1GB and 10GB both formated 
with HPFS.  I have a second OS/2 system that runs the CGI and OS/2 infozip to back up 
my web server using the LAN once a day. The second OS/2 box runs the zip backup 
software and not my primary web server.

hmm.. my xitami is crashing about 3-4 times per day. shit happens.

maybe Xitami v3.0 (if it ever hits the marked and i have a chance to
create an OS/2 version) will help.

if you simply want to run your website, you should give Web/2
(http://dink.org) a try.

i heard from various sources that it is a powerful webserver.

there are steps... 

if i had a good testcase where i can reproduce it on demand on my
machine i can spend some hours for debugging and changing the xitami
sources.

but i never got this "golden testcase" :-)

> Installed Xitami in c:\archivos de programa\xitami

Arg. Do yourself a favor and put Xitami in C:\Xitami.

"Program Files", even in Spanish, has spaces in the file
spacification. While Xitami can work through a file system with
spaces in file specifications, there are a lot of quirks. The
easiest answer is to avoid spaces in folder or file names, at least
at first, so you see it all work.

With Xitami-Win, I usually use #! fee/fie/foo/perl. Really.

Windows isn't unix. Normally the shebang would be ignored. This
would break all unix-inspired Perl scripts. Xitami's clever
workaround is: if there seems to be a goo-looking shebang, but the
specific folder isn't found, then it trawls PATH trying to find the
program. This works on Windows, with the usual Perl setup, without
forcing you to edit every script or maintain an odd unix-y directory
on your windows machine.

> Main HTML directory = c:/website
> Main CGI directory = c:/website/cgi-bin

Usually a BAD idea to have the CGI folder below the public HTML
folder.

Yes, that sounds familiar. Try forcing a trailing slash (I think
Xitami omits it, some popular server adds it, and some scripts
assume something that isn't clearly specified).

Open talkadm.cgi in NotePad and look at these lines:

# For environments where $ENV{'SCRIPT_NAME'} is not defined by the webserver,
# uncomment the line below, after modifying it to suit your environment
#
#$ENV{'SCRIPT_NAME'} = "/cgi-bin/talkadm.cgi";
#
# For environments where $ENV{'PATH_TRANSLATED'} is not defined by the webserver,
# uncomment the line below, after modifying it to suit your environment
#
#$ENV{'PATH_TRANSLATED'} = "../cgi-bin/talkadm.cgi";

A sample Xitami output I have here shows PATH_TRANSLATED as "C:/mw",
without trailing slash or script name. The above seems to want a
full file specification. I hate to hard-code file specifications,
but try editing as the comments say.

Here's another one.

I have some links to files in my site but people can only download them
with standard internet explorer manager (i guess netscape also works).
But if they try to download with another manager, like "Download =
Accelerator Plus", it hangs.
Does someone know why??

Subject: [Xitami] Installing PHP in Xitami
Message-ID: <3D6E3A08.12789.66B6CDB@localhost>

I've been working on installing PHP into Xitami under OS/2.  So far I have found almost 
no documentation to do this (the php web site only talks of Apache on OS/2).  

To date I have followed the windows instructions and just used the PHP 4.2 CGI.EXE for 
OS/2.  However the "mail" command in a PHP file always fails.  So I figure there may be 
a config setting I don't know about?

Does anyone know of a good online FAQ for installing PHP under Xitami OS/2 or 
perhaps have some steps/examples to share?  

Thanks!  Gene

unix machines traditionally have a full mail server. Windows
machines traditionally do not. If they do, it is used so differently
than unix mail that it isn't going to work the way unix-oriented
scripts and script handlers expect.

I was shocked when a perl script on NT4 found my copy of
Communigate Pro (which has a unix-like interface) and sent mail.
Mostly I do NOT expect unix-mail calls to work under Windows,
without extensive script-hacking.

	It *is* possible to send email from PHP under Windows. All you need to
configure is the SMTP server in the PHP.ini file which sits in the Windows
folder.

notepad c:\winnt\php.ini
Edit->Find , SMTP


[mail function]
; For Win32 only.
SMTP = smtp.server.com



	You should also configure sendmail_from. It is the From field when PHP sends
email.


; For Win32 only.
sendmail_from = my@email.address.com

Well it stands to reason that if PHP has worked and your using the 
Windows instruction then editing the php.ini file to point to an 
external mail server would work.

One thing about most mail servers, they don't allow open relays.  That 
means you have your machine log in and check your e-mail within 10 
minutes.  You mail server logs your IP for 10 minutes and them allows 
you to e-mail from that server for then next 10 minutes.

Try installing a small e-mail program that checks your e-mail 9 minutes.

I actualy do have that line installed.  SMTP = my.mailserveraddress.net

But there is another line for unix and was wondering if the OS/2 PHP required that 
instead ss the "mail" still command fails.

	Can you telnet to port 25 on that server ? If you can't, neither can PHP.

	Have you tried running a Network Packet Sniffer watching traffic to/from port
25 while PHP is trying to send the email ? What happens ? ( I use

I have my mail server set to display all connections to the screen.  The PHP never 
initiated a connection to the server.  I will play with the php.ini file some more.  Anyone 
have any examples on how they got it to work under OS/2?

The SW is not present in the Xitami download, nor on the Internet,
not even on http://www.createxe.com/~z/wmkill.zip, as indicated by a past

I badly need such a utility.

hi,

in my opinion this is none of a business to the webserver in use. It's the 
business of your scripting language.

For example with php your tasks could be done like this:

<?
...
$myCommand = exec("chmod 777 myfile");

...
?>

Complete synopsis of exec is exec(string command, array output, integer 
return), latter to params being optional and useful for debugging.
In perl its quiet similar.
Warning; Don't directly put user supplied data into command, escape it 
appropriately first if necessary.

Of course, standard unix security applies, i.e. you can only change 
permissions of files where the credentials/privileges of the user (php 
process) and  the respective file match (this is certainly the case for 
files created via php).

If you try to run perl- or other shellscripts from within php and run into 
troubles review the purpose of the safe_mode_exec_dir" and "safe_mode" 
directives in php.ini and check your settings.

hope this serves as a starting point.

hi,<br><br>
in my opinion this is none of a business to the webserver in use. It's
the business of your scripting language.<br><br>
For example with php your tasks could be done like this:<br><br>
&lt;?<br>
...<br>
$myCommand = exec(&quot;chmod 777 myfile&quot;);<br><br>
...<br>
?&gt;<br><br>
Complete synopsis of exec is exec(string command, array output, integer
return), latter to params being optional and useful for debugging.<br>
In perl its quiet similar.<br>
Warning; Don't directly put user supplied data into command, escape it
appropriately first if necessary.<br><br>

WHY????  Its faster to just use the GUI, I do not understand whats so
difficult about adding 3 colums of information and restarting the server??

Has anyone ever created a script of batch file to automagically creat a site
>rather than go through the GUI?


huh? what? Very magic. No clue what this question is all about.

Hello,
My name is Jeff and I was reading your article about how to get one static
IP address to go to multiple webpages. I was wondering if you could tell me
how to get multiple IP addresses to direct to one single website. for
example;
www.xxx.com; www.yyy.com; and www.zzz.com would all go to the same website.
How is this done?
your help will be great. thanks,
Jeff

Message-ID: <3D5A23FC.5008.1FAA5500@localhost>

Just to add my two cents worth, have been running the latest Zone
Alarm Pro on my two Windows 98 servers, one of which runs Xitami, and
have had no issues at all.  The only issues I've experienced with 
Zone Alarm is that it got into a major cat fight with EScan from 
MWTI.

One thing to look for:  If you move your "webpages" and "cgi-bin" folders 
from their default locations, make sure that the paths do not have any 
spaces in the names of the files or folders.  I was having problems such as 
you described after I decided to move my work to a folder with a name like 
"my site"

There's nothing in the Xitami documentation about this.  I would have been 
tearing my hair out if I had any.  A search of this list's archives saved me.

hehehee   ok relax man, people can live with half a brain......
Ok to change your password is a very simple thing.  Go to the directory that
you installed Xitami and you will see a file in there called xitami.aut, if
you open this file with notepad you will see where you put your default
password.

Ok, then, how about someone answers my one question then? How do I 
change admin passwords? I only wanted to e-mail that question to Xitami 
tech support in the first place. I don't need to know anything else 
about Xitami. I need this one and only this one question answered. I'm 
assuming everyone is ignoring it, thinking I haven't read the 
instructions in the FAQ. I have. I've gone over them backwards forwards 
and sideways. I've tried many different ways of interpreting those 
directions. I've tried reinstalling the darn thing. If someone who knows 
what they're doing will answer this simple freaking question, I will be 
forever done with this list. But asking me"did you read the FAQ" or 
repeating that I edit the Xitami.aut file does me absolutely no good. 
Please assume that I have at least half a brain, and that I tried 
everything in the FAQ and on the Xitami help pages BEFORE signing on to 
this list.
Sorry to get touchy, but I'm running out of time, and my job is at the 
moment dependent on this question being answered.
