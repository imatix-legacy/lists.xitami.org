Thanks, Paul, that _is_ what I meant. A how to, both with respect to 
setting it up and how to use it. But as you say isn't FTP better for the 
large upload/download figures that I'm going to be creating?

Subject: [Xitami] Configuring your Web server to handle the DjVu MIME Types
Message-ID: <200201010822640.SM00191@there>

DjVu is a new file format becoming popular for posting scanned documents to 
web sites.  For example one document I just dealt with was 520K as DjVu and 
3.6 Megs as a PDF.

Check out:
http://www.djvuzone.org/

http://any2web.djvuzone.org/

http://openlib.djvuzone.org/

Now my question is how do I get xitami to serve these DjVu file types?

I added these to xitami.cfg:
    #   Image MIME types
    djv=image/x.djvu
    djvu=image/x.djvu

Can I put those in default.cfg or must mime types be in xitami.cfg?

However they don't seem to show up when I restart the server from the /admin 
screen.  I did back all the way up to the first screen like one of the 
recent messages said to do.

Xitami wants to download rather than serve the files.

Info on how to do this for Apache:

If you get garbled output when attempting to view DjVu documents
from your web page using Netscape, it means your web server
software is not configured to serve the DjVu mime.types.
The bib2web server automatically includes a hidden file named .htaccess
in the output TAR/ZIP file. This hidden file tells your web server
to serve .djvu files with the image/x.djvu mime.type.
However, certain types of web servers do not recognize this file,
in which case you must ask your system administrator to
configure your web server to serve DjVu files properly.

If your Web server runs the Apache web server, please follow the instructions 
below. If your server runs another Web server than Apache, please visit  
http://djvuzone.org/support/tutorial/chapter-serving.html#mime2
for instructions on how to configure it to serve DjVu documents.

Using a text editor, edit the file mimes.types file 
     used by your Web server (generally /etc/mime.types)

On which point, could you possibly configure your "at home" mailer the
same as the one you have there at work?

Everything you send to the list from "home" is duplicated, in that it's
sending in both plain ASCII (good) and HTML (bad).

(Of course, the ideal would be for the mailing list exploder to reject
anything that contains HTML, or a MIME type of multipart/alternative.)

I'm making these remarks in public, rather than in a private e-mail to
SandMan, because there are other posters to the list that also dual send,
or write in HTML (yeuck).

Apart from the more-firewall-friendly aspect, I feel that you are being
more than a little unfair on both FTP and its implementors.
(Particularly in referring to Jon Postel as a "grad student".)

Might I remind you of the following (from RFC-1123, dated October 1989)?

         The File Transfer Protocol FTP is the primary Internet standard
         for file transfer.  The current specification is contained in
         RFC-959 [FTP:1].

         FTP uses separate simultaneous TCP connections for control and
         for data transfer.  The FTP protocol includes many features,
         some of which are not commonly implemented.  However, for every
         feature in FTP, there exists at least one implementation.  The
         minimum implementation defined in RFC-959 was too small, so a
         somewhat larger minimum implementation is defined here.

         Internet users have been unnecessarily burdened for years by
         deficient FTP implementations.  Protocol implementors have
         suffered from the erroneous opinion that implementing FTP ought
         to be a small and trivial task.  This is wrong, because FTP has
         a user interface, because it has to deal (correctly) with the
         whole variety of communication and operating system errors that
         may occur, and because it has to handle the great diversity of
         real file systems in the world.

It was RFC-1123 (aka STD-3), incidentally, which first standardized
certain extensions to FTP, such as PASV.  There are also more recent RFCs
which amplify 959, including at least three which have the status of
"proposed standard".

Well he was a grad student :-)  (At least in the early 1980s when FTP
was first being invented; the later RFCs/standards simply consolidated
things somewhat.)

Some of the generality of FTP was useful once (such as translating from
old IBM mainframes to ASCII based systems and such like), but much of it
has outlived its usefulness.  That combined with the fact that FTP and
firewalls badly disagree with each other means that I'd be pretty happy
to see FTP go away for good.

I think it would be correct to say your _browser_ wants to
download the file. Either way, Xitami is offering to serve the
file... your browser either knows what to do (and most browsers
don't know what Djvu is) or save it for you to deal with later.

Have you installed a Djvu reader in your browser? Do you expect
all your surfers to already have Djvu support? 

The standard technique seems to be to use EMBED to force download
of a reader that knows what Djvu is; see:

Your right.  Just tried Netscape and it did The Right Thing.  Seems the 
plugin for Opera under Linux didn't work for some reason, and I always use 
Opera. :-(

If they want to see what I have they will get it, I supply links to the 
places that they get the plugins from.

The format looks very useful so I installed the plug-in. 

Argh.

"Auto-install" ran around in circles. I installed manually,
verified that DjVu was showing in Plug-Ins.

Even so, it is VERY hard to find a "working" DjVu page. Most of
them, on various servers, come up as gibberish. Yes, those
extensions are set in my browser. Are ALL these webmasters
posting bigabytes of files that don't work because of server
configuration?

The djvuzone page has some hard to find links to samples. The
Franklin catalog works GREAT: this blows-away PDF. 

But most sites just make my browser want to download. So I saved
a DjVu file to my machine, then forced NetScape to look at the
file. Interestingly, now it opens the viewer, but the document is
blank.

I dunno. I see rave reviews and lots of stuff posted in this
format, but it mostly don't work for me.

Under Windows I've never had a problem with Auto, but under Linux it has 
never worked right.

Alas your right.  Even my own current web site tells you that you must 
download them to view them.

In my case my ISP controls the server, and I control the web site.  I've 
asked them many times to fix the problem, but they never even respond.

Did you check out the "Digital Library"?

If running under Windows download DjVu Shop from http://www.lizardtech.com/ 
if running under Linux build djview from the Source Forge site.  They you can 
tell if it is a bad djvu document or a plug-in problem.

Are you using virtual hosts? Is favicon.ico in the root directory for that
virtual host?

Yes and yes. Nevermind, I got it to work a few minutes ago. I had to flush the

There are settings in Netscape and Opera that allow you to always
go to the server and avoid cache. These are great for when developing.
I think IE does the same.

For escape characters:

"\n" is not recognized by any browser because it is perl-syntax, not html.
The same applies for other escapes.

If you use

print "I want this\nand another line";

you will get one line in the browser but two lines in the source code (as
seen from the browser).

In order to have two lines, you have to use

print "I want this<br>and another line";

which will be one line in source code but two lines in the browser.

Hello Folks,

Why is it that the "\n"  and other escape characters in my Perl script are
not being recognized in the IOExplorer browser?? I start the html code with
the prescribed  .....print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";..... I'm running
Win NT 4.0 and perl5 and IOExplorer 5.5.

By the way, after much pain and suffering, I discovered from this Q&A list
that I had to include the ".pl=application/x-http-perl" statement in the
Mime section and "pl=C:\perlpath\perl.exe" in the Filter section of the
Defaults.cfg file in order to get my NT 4.0 to execute the Perl5 script.
Thanks for that.

Subject: [Xitami] HTML using Perl


Hello Folks,

Why is it that the "\n"  and other escape characters in my Perl script are
not being recognized in the IOExplorer browser?? I start the html code =
with
the prescribed  .....print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";..... I'm running
Win NT 4.0 and perl5 and IOExplorer 5.5.

By the way, after much pain and suffering, I discovered from this Q&A list
that I had to include the ".pl=3Dapplication/x-http-perl" statement in the
Mime section and "pl=3DC:\perlpath\perl.exe" in the Filter section of the
Defaults.cfg file in order to get my NT 4.0 to execute the Perl5 script.
Thanks for that.

Regards to all!

Forget the "favicon.ico". Apparently, the "favicon" part is just for

I am serving an intranet via 100 mbps ethernet. 
Am connected to internet via 300 kbps SDSL.
Static IP's.

I'm developing Shockwave. I need to test how my
stuff will work on a 28kbps modem.

Is there a way to throttle Xitami ... to slow it down
so that I can gauge performance on slower modems?

I was really wanting to avoid having to purchase a 
dial up account for this purpose only.

Any ideas ?

Thanks !

Well, if all else fails, net-zero still provides free dial-up connections.
And even with all its banners, its still faster than AOL.

Good luck,

I believe that the FP extensions work in IIS only.
IIS is risky business, which makes Front Page pretty 
much obsolete.  I took one look at FP and spend
the $ on Macromedia Dreamweaver.

Well, it was what I had and I got it free after giving Microsoft hell on
their lousy support of their crappy software ;')

How does Dreamweaver handle essential server side stuff like forms
processing? Do you write or borrow your own scripts or does Dreamweaver
autogenerate a perl script and you have to upload to the cgi-bin and
fiddle permissions? It would be nice if they generated php scripts now,
since you don't have to mess with those annoying permissions with php.

I program Visual Basic and Macromedia Shockwave Director. 
I used to use ASP for stuff. 
Now I'm doing more CGI for communication when I want to read the server.
For posting to the server (from Shockwave)  ... I send an email to the server with the data encrypted.
A robot on my mail server unencrypts the email and posts data accordingly.
I like this because I can buffer a lot of heavy traffic on the email server,
and take my time doing the post. Plus I know I can't get hacked.
The robot has permissions into the database, but the email server can't see it.



I don't know a thing about Perl.
Dreamweaver is going to build your front end. I don't know about it's ability to build CGI scripts.

To build forms and corresponding CGI scripts in PERL, I saw this site. Haven't checked it
out ...

Is it normal for Xitami to randomly delete all your old log files?  If so is
there a way around this?  Seems that after a week of activity..it wipes all
the old and starts new.  I have it set to change everynight to a new file.
The logs are very imp. to me as it let's me know if my site has been

Assuming you are on a windows platform (I think so) then the only thing 
you need is Perl itself. I use activestate perl latest whatever version 
and xitami on both Linux and windows and it all works wonderfully.

Occasionally you will find a perl script that barfs, generally because 
it has an expectation of Unix/Linux and/or Apache (e.g. I saw one that 
tried to look for .htaccess files), but they are rare and generally 
there are alternatives that aren't so badly written.

What do you mean by "ALL"?  It doesn't have half a dozen language
interpreters built in if that is what you are getting at.

Xitami does support most common CGI programs, although it has onlimited
non-parsed-header support, and it doesn't support flushing output to the
client before the end of the CGI run.  There are also reports that some
variable definitions are different from what is expected.

CGI is just a thin specification for an interface between a webserver and an
external program. It does NOT specify what that external program IS, so the
answer to your question is "No". 

I have CGI scripts written in DOS BAT file, and Visual Basic. unix shell
scripting is popular, but only on unix machines. There's also REXX and AWK and
one that sounds like a snake. 

The most popular tool for scripting today must be Perl, which as Francis said
you'll have to get and install. (Perl is much bigger and more often updated
than Xitami so it makes no sense to include Perl in an Xitami download.)

   Yeah, so is everybody else. I saw their memo on thier website.
I figure If I ask the write questions, maybe somebody would copy

What about the VB kernal, does it need to be in the path
in order for Xitami to run a CGI script written in VB? Or are
U saying Xitami will handle the routines by itself?

   I'm just trying to find out what options already
come with xitami, if I don't absolutely need Perl,
I'd like to know what my other options are. I'm NO
expert on computer languages (scripts), and the

Do other webpages work with your domain?  If not, you probably need to
check your domain is properly configured in the DNS.  If so and you are
doing virtual hosting, check your virtual hosting settings.

With Delphi you can create CGI exe files that Xitami handles just fine.
Of course, you have to have Delphi to compile with (a couple of hundred
$) and the shareware CGI-Xpert component makes life easier, but since we
develop everything in Delphi it was a cost effective way for us to go.

Basicly, xitami can run with any scripting language you want so comes
with all options. The catch is: you have to install the tool of your
choice yourself.

For example for the scripting language PHP (which you can get for free
at  www.php.net), you would just need to explain xitami to run php.exe
with all files which end with '.php', but only after you installed the
php.exe, of course...

Installing computer(scripting)languages is out of the scope of the
xitami manual. Refer to the computerlanguage of your choice to find
out how to install it on your system.

I have serveral name-based v-hosts and I want to create an alias so
http://myvhost/music goes to a directory on another dirve. I tried setting

protect this folder, if possible, and how to protect other folders as well,
assumming this is the same process.

if anyone can tell me how to do this, I'd appreciate it.

CGI written in VB (visual basic i suppose) don't need a VB kernel, since 
the code is compiled (resulting in an exe file)
When a normal script (like a dos batch file) executes the command processor 
has to be loaded first, the source compiled line per line (every time your 
script is called) and the resulting commands executed.

btw vb is not that efficient when it comes to handling cgi: vb is written 
with forms and user interaction and other visual stuff in mind. When vb 
loads, a lot of unnessary ballast is loaded altogether. cgi handling is 
actually just plain text processing, no visual effects (that part is done 
by the client browser). Should try Power Basic Console Compiler.

I write in both C++, Delphi and VB and really have no preference in 
regards to CGI.   All use about the same amount of memory and 
resources.  VB uses standard nonvisual modules for this. There's 
excellent FREE code out for all.  Particularly for VB there's 
CGI4VB (search Google ~ it's everywhere) which offers an easy 
"out of the box" experience.

Never mind - I figured it out.  I am running Naviscope on port 81 to block
Ads etc.

-----Original Message-----
When I start Xitami it immediately turns Red.

console.log says:

2002/01/09 11:53:39: xilrwp: Could not open LRWP port 81

2002/01/09 11:53:39: smtftpc: closing FTP connections on port 21

I am not aware of any app's using port 81 on my system, but assuming there
are, can someone suggest a port probe or something to tell me what it might
be?

Thanks

Message-ID: <200201092018.VAA21773@sxpublic.nxrda.imatix.net>

By removing any and all forms from the VB project and using modules and classes ... you can get an EXE down to 28 - 32k that loads in a flash.

Yes, the VB virtual machine must also load. There are tools that allow you to keep these DLL's in memory, along with ADO.

This will provide even better response.

I only prefer VB because I've been programming in it for years. Of course ... there are other solutions, and VB is a Windows solution.

I'm not a MS freak, quite the contrary. I do Front end work in Shockwave. But for back end work, VB on an NT machine
running Xitami is quite nice.

Furthermore, I use VB and Director Shockwave EXE's as robots to read incoming emails.

I only use CGI for 'insecure' stuff ... stuff I don't care who sees.  For security, I encrypt emails and have robots read and decrypt the email content.

Very nice, all works quite well on the same server.  A 166 mhz Cyrix !

As I get bigger, I will put email server on another box, mySQL on another box and yet another box for the robots to execute.

ps. NT must be secured. Out the box it's insecure.

Subject: [Xitami] PHP
Message-ID: <000301c1994c$bd4674c0$0801a8c0@alexd>

In c:\xitami\xitami.cfg I have the following section:

[Filter]
    .ssi=perlssi                        #   Pass *.ssi to PerlSSI
    .shtm=perlssi                       #   Pass *.shtm to PerlSSI
    .shtml=perlssi                      #   Pass *.shtml to PerlSSI
    .php=C:\PHP\php3.exe

I have php3.exe in C:\PHP.

When I go to a php document I get the following error:
Internal error: your request was unsuccessful
Cannot create CGI process - program not found

It seems to be saying it can't find php.exe!

Any ideas what I have missed?  I tried changing the reference to
c:\php\php3.exe in case there is case thing going on but it made no
difference.

Thanks,
Alex Davidson

I apologize for the long email but I wanted to include as many details as
possible upfront.

 I am running a website (www.hanleytime.com) and am very happy with it
except for the fact that not everyone can connect. (view the website). It is
a family tree website so my traffic is very limited. I was using PWS but
didn't like the way it ran so I switched  to Xatami . My brother said it was
much faster using your software when he connected to my website.

The following can connect at will.

1. Friend using Roadrunner
2. Mother using dialup
3. Brother using dialup
4. Myself locally
5. From work using dialup

The following cannot connect at any time. Ping and tracert do not work to my
site either.

1. Friend using Roadrunner
2. Sister using dialup
3. From work using a T1
4. Aunt using (not sure)
5. TZO Tech Support

I had people from the first list be able to view the website at the same
time that some people from the second were not getting anything.

System details

1.333 Ghz Althlon
512 mb ram
40 gb hard drive
DSL connection through Earthlink/Mindspring. Handled by Covad.
Linksys router (forwarding port 80 tcp to 192.168.1.5) I use Wallwatcher to
view the router log files.

Windows 98 SE with all patches/updates from Microsoft site.
IE 6.0 128 bit encryption with all patches/updates from Microsoft site.
Norton Personal Firewall 2.0 with the latest and greatest.
Norton Antivirus 2000
TZO client
Various family tree software

Network settings. IP 192.168.1.5 subnet mask 255.255.255.0 - Gateway
192.168.1.1 (Linksys router) - DNS 207.69.188.186 and 207.69.188.185
(Mindspring DNS) Hostname - pongboy (my computer name)

I have tested it with the firewall disabled and also uninstalled. Right now
it is installed since it didn't make any difference.

I have uninstalled and reinstalled the Xitami software. It is a very easy
setup but not 100% sure that it is correct. I kept most of the defaults but
turned things off such as FTP etc.

I do show them in the Wallwatcher log as an incoming connection and I do see
them as an active connection in the Xitami icon.

But for some reason the people on the second list do not get any pages
served to them.

I am by no means an expert in running a webserver but I do know a little. My
friend is an MSCE + Internet + a few others and he is stumped as to why this
is happening.
I have had someone at TZO try to do some testing remotely but they can't hit
the site or my computer either.

Any insight or a push in a certain direction to help me figure out the
problem will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for any help/direction you can provide.

  Subject: [Xitami] FW: Website using Xitami


  I apologize for the long email but I wanted to include as many details =
as possible upfront.=20

   I am running a website (www.hanleytime.com) and am very happy with it =
except for the fact that not everyone can connect. (view the website). =
It is a family tree website so my traffic is very limited. I was using =
PWS but didn't like the way it ran so I switched  to Xatami . My brother =
said it was much faster using your software when he connected to my =
website.  =20

  The following can connect at will.

  1. Friend using Roadrunner
  2. Mother using dialup
  3. Brother using dialup
  4. Myself locally
  5. From work using dialup

  The following cannot connect at any time. Ping and tracert do not work =
to my site either.

  1. Friend using Roadrunner
  2. Sister using dialup
  3. From work using a T1
  4. Aunt using (not sure)
  5. TZO Tech Support

  I had people from the first list be able to view the website at the =
same time that some people from the second were not getting anything.

  System details

  1.333 Ghz Althlon
  512 mb ram
  40 gb hard drive
  DSL connection through Earthlink/Mindspring. Handled by Covad.
  Linksys router (forwarding port 80 tcp to 192.168.1.5) I use =
Wallwatcher to view the router log files.

  Windows 98 SE with all patches/updates from Microsoft site.
  IE 6.0 128 bit encryption with all patches/updates from Microsoft =
site.
  Norton Personal Firewall 2.0 with the latest and greatest.
  Norton Antivirus 2000
  TZO client
  Various family tree software=20

  Network settings. IP 192.168.1.5 subnet mask 255.255.255.0 - Gateway =
192.168.1.1 (Linksys router) - DNS 207.69.188.186 and 207.69.188.185 =
(Mindspring DNS) Hostname - pongboy (my computer name)=20

  I have tested it with the firewall disabled and also uninstalled. =
Right now it is installed since it didn't make any difference.

  I have uninstalled and reinstalled the Xitami software. It is a very =
easy setup but not 100% sure that it is correct. I kept most of the =
defaults but turned things off such as FTP etc.

  I do show them in the Wallwatcher log as an incoming connection and I =
do see them as an active connection in the Xitami icon.

  But for some reason the people on the second list do not get any pages =
served to them.

  I am by no means an expert in running a webserver but I do know a =
little. My friend is an MSCE + Internet + a few others and he is stumped =
as to why this is happening.
  I have had someone at TZO try to do some testing remotely but they =
can't hit the site or my computer either.

  Any insight or a push in a certain direction to help me figure out the =
problem will be greatly appreciated.

  Thank you in advance for any help/direction you can provide.

   I got two suggestions.. 

1) ditch the firewall, you don't need it with Xitami, I tried using
sygates firewall, and all it did was get in the way.

2) Sprint will hook U up with a static IP, for $10 more a month plus
a small connection fee.

You might also wanna verify that your telephone lines are properly
grounded.



Best wishes

Sorry, I should have stated. I am on a DSL so my public address constantly
changes. My current address is 66.32.68.16

The 192.168.1.5 is my internal address.

You seem to have more than one problem. Checking your DNS record I find your
site listed at 66.32.68.16 which is not correct from what you state. Also
when I ping the 192.168.1.5 I get returns from 207.218.53.201 and cannot
resolve the name through DNS of that IP. I am an ISP connected direct to the
internet through a T1 connection.

  I apologize for the long email but I wanted to include as many details as
possible upfront.

   I am running a website (www.hanleytime.com) and am very happy with it
except for the fact that not everyone can connect. (view the website). It is
a family tree website so my traffic is very limited. I was using PWS but
didn't like the way it ran so I switched  to Xatami . My brother said it was
much faster using your software when he connected to my website.

  The following can connect at will.

  1. Friend using Roadrunner
  2. Mother using dialup
  3. Brother using dialup
  4. Myself locally
  5. From work using dialup

  The following cannot connect at any time. Ping and tracert do not work to
my site either.

  1. Friend using Roadrunner
  2. Sister using dialup
  3. From work using a T1
  4. Aunt using (not sure)
  5. TZO Tech Support

  I had people from the first list be able to view the website at the same
time that some people from the second were not getting anything.

  System details

  1.333 Ghz Althlon
  512 mb ram
  40 gb hard drive
  DSL connection through Earthlink/Mindspring. Handled by Covad.
  Linksys router (forwarding port 80 tcp to 192.168.1.5) I use Wallwatcher
to view the router log files.

  Windows 98 SE with all patches/updates from Microsoft site.
  IE 6.0 128 bit encryption with all patches/updates from Microsoft site.
  Norton Personal Firewall 2.0 with the latest and greatest.
  Norton Antivirus 2000
  TZO client
  Various family tree software

  Network settings. IP 192.168.1.5 subnet mask 255.255.255.0 - Gateway
192.168.1.1 (Linksys router) - DNS 207.69.188.186 and 207.69.188.185
(Mindspring DNS) Hostname - pongboy (my computer name)

  I have tested it with the firewall disabled and also uninstalled. Right
now it is installed since it didn't make any difference.

  I have uninstalled and reinstalled the Xitami software. It is a very easy
setup but not 100% sure that it is correct. I kept most of the defaults but
turned things off such as FTP etc.

  I do show them in the Wallwatcher log as an incoming connection and I do
see them as an active connection in the Xitami icon.

  But for some reason the people on the second list do not get any pages
served to them.

  I am by no means an expert in running a webserver but I do know a little.
My friend is an MSCE + Internet + a few others and he is stumped as to why
this is happening.
  I have had someone at TZO try to do some testing remotely but they can't
hit the site or my computer either.

  Any insight or a push in a certain direction to help me figure out the
problem will be greatly appreciated.

  Thank you in advance for any help/direction you can provide.

Thanks.

1. I tried uninstalling it but got the same exact result.

2. Is a static ip necessary? I use TZO to update the DNS records with my
current ip. It checks it once a minute.

   I got two suggestions..

1) ditch the firewall, you don't need it with Xitami, I tried using
sygates firewall, and all it did was get in the way.

2) Sprint will hook U up with a static IP, for $10 more a month plus
a small connection fee.

You might also wanna verify that your telephone lines are properly
grounded.



Best wishes

In running a tracert on that address it gets stopped in Mindsprings =

your DSL hookup. This is common with a lot of DSL providers.

    Any insight or a push in a certain direction to help me figure out =
the problem will be greatly appreciated.

    Thank you in advance for any help/direction you can provide.

> Is a static ip necessary? I use TZO

Nice but not necessary. Using TZO to associate your name address to your
hopping IP number will give momentary glitches, but works well for many
people. 

In particular: if someone hits right after your IP number changes, they won't
connect until TZO gets updated. Since you say "checks it once a minute", that
should never leave you invisible for long.

A bigger issue, and I am not sure how this works, is that various ISPs may
cache DNS records on their own DNS servers rather than keep going to a DNS
server in authority. That's standard practice, the authoritative DNS record
can give a suggested time of updating, and I suppose TZO must be setting their
update suggestion shorter than a DNS system full of hard-wired "permanent IP"
machines like mine. But other ISP DNS servers are free to ignore it, and use
cached DNS records as long as they want. 

>  Ping and tracert 

By name, I assume. What happens if you call them on the phone, tell them the
IP number you are on at that moment, and they ping that number? i.e. is it a
DNS issue or is your IP number just not reachable? 

FWIW: ping 66.32.68.16 at 7:10 PM EST fails for me; tracert stops tracking
after three hops inside MindSpring. Omitting known route through my campus
routers and my usual ALTER.NET backbone routers:

But the people that can hit it are able to run a tracert.

And the people that can't do get logged in the router log and show in the
Xitami log. Doesn't that mean that they are getting through Mindsprings
network?

Could this still be an ISP issue? I haven't brought it up with them yet. I
started with TZO, then here.

In running a tracert on that address it gets stopped in Mindsprings Network
and does not proceed. It looks like Mindspring has a block on your DSL
hookup. This is common with a lot of DSL providers.

  Sorry, I should have stated. I am on a DSL so my public address constantly
changes. My current address is 66.32.68.16

  The 192.168.1.5 is my internal address.

  You seem to have more than one problem. Checking your DNS record I find
your site listed at 66.32.68.16 which is not correct from what you state.
Also when I ping the 192.168.1.5 I get returns from 207.218.53.201 and
cannot resolve the name through DNS of that IP. I am an ISP connected direct
to the internet through a T1 connection.

    I apologize for the long email but I wanted to include as many details
as possible upfront.

     I am running a website (www.hanleytime.com) and am very happy with it
except for the fact that not everyone can connect. (view the website). It is
a family tree website so my traffic is very limited. I was using PWS but
didn't like the way it ran so I switched  to Xatami . My brother said it was
much faster using your software when he connected to my website.

    The following can connect at will.

    1. Friend using Roadrunner
    2. Mother using dialup
    3. Brother using dialup
    4. Myself locally
    5. From work using dialup

    The following cannot connect at any time. Ping and tracert do not work
to my site either.

    1. Friend using Roadrunner
    2. Sister using dialup
    3. From work using a T1
    4. Aunt using (not sure)
    5. TZO Tech Support

    I had people from the first list be able to view the website at the same
time that some people from the second were not getting anything.

    System details

    1.333 Ghz Althlon
    512 mb ram
    40 gb hard drive
    DSL connection through Earthlink/Mindspring. Handled by Covad.
    Linksys router (forwarding port 80 tcp to 192.168.1.5) I use Wallwatcher
to view the router log files.

    Windows 98 SE with all patches/updates from Microsoft site.
    IE 6.0 128 bit encryption with all patches/updates from Microsoft site.
    Norton Personal Firewall 2.0 with the latest and greatest.
    Norton Antivirus 2000
    TZO client
    Various family tree software

    Network settings. IP 192.168.1.5 subnet mask 255.255.255.0 - Gateway
192.168.1.1 (Linksys router) - DNS 207.69.188.186 and 207.69.188.185
(Mindspring DNS) Hostname - pongboy (my computer name)

    I have tested it with the firewall disabled and also uninstalled. Right
now it is installed since it didn't make any difference.

    I have uninstalled and reinstalled the Xitami software. It is a very
easy setup but not 100% sure that it is correct. I kept most of the defaults
but turned things off such as FTP etc.

    I do show them in the Wallwatcher log as an incoming connection and I do
see them as an active connection in the Xitami icon.

    But for some reason the people on the second list do not get any pages
served to them.

    I am by no means an expert in running a webserver but I do know a
little. My friend is an MSCE + Internet + a few others and he is stumped as
to why this is happening.
    I have had someone at TZO try to do some testing remotely but they can't
hit the site or my computer either.

    Any insight or a push in a certain direction to help me figure out the
problem will be greatly appreciated.

    Thank you in advance for any help/direction you can provide.

By name or number. I had them try both.

I have had a few people try and hit the site since I sent the first email
and no one has successfully connected.

They are showing up in the Wallwatcher log and in the Xitami access log.

I usually keep the same ip for approximately two-three days. I haven't kept
full track. Only the one minute check time is when the server is not
available during this change. One of the people that can connect hit during
that minute once but waited and was able to get in right after TZO actually
updated.

> Is a static ip necessary? I use TZO

Nice but not necessary. Using TZO to associate your name address to your
hopping IP number will give momentary glitches, but works well for many
people.

In particular: if someone hits right after your IP number changes, they
won't
connect until TZO gets updated. Since you say "checks it once a minute",
that
should never leave you invisible for long.

A bigger issue, and I am not sure how this works, is that various ISPs may
cache DNS records on their own DNS servers rather than keep going to a DNS
server in authority. That's standard practice, the authoritative DNS record
can give a suggested time of updating, and I suppose TZO must be setting
their
update suggestion shorter than a DNS system full of hard-wired "permanent
IP"
machines like mine. But other ISP DNS servers are free to ignore it, and use
cached DNS records as long as they want.

>  Ping and tracert

By name, I assume. What happens if you call them on the phone, tell them the
IP number you are on at that moment, and they ping that number? i.e. is it a
DNS issue or is your IP number just not reachable?

FWIW: ping 66.32.68.16 at 7:10 PM EST fails for me; tracert stops tracking
after three hops inside MindSpring. Omitting known route through my campus

Are you sure you're using php3 ??? php3 has been out of date for a LONG time
now; if so maybe you should download & install php4 (php.exe & friends) from
www.php.net. Also make sure that your system PATH variable contains the path to
the php.exe, perferably at the very beginning as Xitami seems to occasionally
have difficulty locating the main php dll if it is not on the path.

Paul


In c:\xitami\xitami.cfg I have the following section:

[Filter]
    .ssi=perlssi                        #   Pass *.ssi to PerlSSI
    .shtm=perlssi                       #   Pass *.shtm to PerlSSI
    .shtml=perlssi                      #   Pass *.shtml to PerlSSI
    .php=C:\PHP\php3.exe

I have php3.exe in C:\PHP.

When I go to a php document I get the following error:
Internal error: your request was unsuccessful
Cannot create CGI process - program not found

It seems to be saying it can't find php.exe!

Any ideas what I have missed?  I tried changing the reference to
c:\php\php3.exe in case there is case thing going on but it made no
difference.

Thanks,
Alex Davidson

Forgive my ignorance Gunner, I'm a veteran C++ / Database & embedded systems
programmer but I've only been doing web programming (mostly with php) for about
12 months. I'd like to know more about robots, what they can do, their
architecture & implimentation. Are there any web refererences you can give me
that explain more ???

Paul



By removing any and all forms from the VB project and using modules and classes
... you can get an EXE down to 28 - 32k that loads in a flash.

Yes, the VB virtual machine must also load. There are tools that allow you to
keep these DLL's in memory, along with ADO.

This will provide even better response.

I only prefer VB because I've been programming in it for years. Of course ...
there are other solutions, and VB is a Windows solution.

I'm not a MS freak, quite the contrary. I do Front end work in Shockwave. But
for back end work, VB on an NT machine
running Xitami is quite nice.

Furthermore, I use VB and Director Shockwave EXE's as robots to read incoming
emails.

I only use CGI for 'insecure' stuff ... stuff I don't care who sees.  For
security, I encrypt emails and have robots read and decrypt the email content.

Very nice, all works quite well on the same server.  A 166 mhz Cyrix !

As I get bigger, I will put email server on another box, mySQL on another box
and yet another box for the robots to execute.

ps. NT must be secured. Out the box it's insecure.

   The simple fact is, the fewer redirects you have, the better.

One other thought occurred to me. Do you have power saving
features turned on? If you do, you might wanna turn them off.
My experience, and the experience of others is that all they do
is get in the way.

   Like the other person says, it sounds like you have multiple
problems.

   Also, if your server isn't dedicated, you might wanna make
it so. Strip it down software wise, don't put anything on it
that isn't necessary for WEB management.

   Xitami is fast, there is NO reason to use such a powerful
machine as you describe. It's a waste really,  all you really
need for top performance is any computer capable of
handling a PCI NIC. I run mine on a 586 dx4 100, it just putts
along in my backroom. I then use another computer for my 
personal use.

Hope this helps..

Thanks. Why would the redirects bother some and not others? The two on
roadrunner have the exact same setup but one can hit and the other can't.
(same computer, same everything) I don't want to get a static ip address
unless I know it is the fix for my problem. I'm inclined to think it is
something on my end but I could be wrong. That is why I am using this avenue
to see.

No, I turn all the power saving features off. I only have a screen saver.

It's only on this computer because it is the only one I have at the moment.
I do want to get a dedicated one but I need to work through these issues
first. I have plans of hosting another virtual site and want to get the
kinks out first.

Sure. I use  IA mail server (on same box as Xitami) ... www.tnsoft.com
I write an EXE that can accept command line parameters, explained in a moment.
When a mail comes into a specific 'robot' email account, the mail server writes the email content to the hard drive and starts the EXE, providing as a parameter the 
path to the email file it just wrote.

After that, it's a matter of permissions and what you want to do with the email.
In this case, I have remote programs (clients) that via code ... send the email to a specific email address.
My robots ... EXE's .. unencrypt the data and based on the structure of the data, post the data to the 
database and send confirmation emails .

Advantage 1 ... The server ( 166 mhz Cyrix) can access 250 messages in 15 seconds without barking.  The messages are cached and stored until the contents are 
executed.

Advantage 2 ... The data sits encrypted in the mail message. Even if hacked, the contents are useless to intruders.

Advantage 3 ... The robots are run sequentially and can take their time.

Advantage 4 ... The robots can actually execute on another machine and 'poll' for new messages. With this technique, I can build a transaction processing system.

Works for me.  I use CGI, but not to post data. Only to read content from a relational database and run the queries on the server.

Ok, a few things here:

First off you should always have a firewall ESPECIALLY if your on a broadband
connection. My suggestion the freeware ZoneAlarm (www.zonealarm.com)  is both
easy to use and install.

Second, I use both dynamic ip addresses on my server as well as my server not
being dedicated and it acts JUST fine.

I use ZoneEdit (www.zoneedit.com) and the DirectUpdate engine for updating
the ip address. There have been no problems OTHER than the fact that most
isp's block port 80, forcing me to redirect all port 80 traffic to port 4080
which I accomplished easily using ZonEedit.

Now, as far as the speed of xitami is concerned, yes it's fast but a fast
webserver gets easily bogged down once you start to add things like PHP,
MySQL or ASP emulation. So depending on how much use you are getting out of
it and how fast your dsl is, it better to be safe than sorry.

Just my 2 cents.

I was using Zonealarm but Mindspring gave me a free copy of Norton Personal
Firewall. I also think that I should have a firewall. I only uninstalled it
the once to see if it made a difference.

Is there a way to find out if port 80 is blocked with the ISP? Is this
something I can ask them? The only thing about this question is that some
people can get in every time.

I haven't tried to redirect it to another port such as 4080, which I can do
through the router setup and Xitami.

I only run Xitami without any of the addons. The family tree software spits
out the webpages so I can copy them into the webpages directory and have
them available.

Subject: [Xitami] CGI
Message-ID: <4A256B3D.000EB289.00@shb1ln11.transport.qld.gov.au>


Thanks, that's perfect ... all I needed to know (now I'll go & play)

Paul


Sure. I use  IA mail server (on same box as Xitami) ... www.tnsoft.com
I write an EXE that can accept command line parameters, explained in a moment.
When a mail comes into a specific 'robot' email account, the mail server writes
the email content to the hard drive and starts the EXE, providing as a parameter
the
path to the email file it just wrote.

After that, it's a matter of permissions and what you want to do with the email.
In this case, I have remote programs (clients) that via code ... send the email
to a specific email address.
My robots ... EXE's .. unencrypt the data and based on the structure of the
data, post the data to the
database and send confirmation emails .

Advantage 1 ... The server ( 166 mhz Cyrix) can access 250 messages in 15
seconds without barking.  The messages are cached and stored until the contents
are
executed.

Advantage 2 ... The data sits encrypted in the mail message. Even if hacked, the
contents are useless to intruders.

Advantage 3 ... The robots are run sequentially and can take their time.

Advantage 4 ... The robots can actually execute on another machine and 'poll'
for new messages. With this technique, I can build a transaction processing
system.

Works for me.  I use CGI, but not to post data. Only to read content from a
relational database and run the queries on the server.

   If U have "File Sharing" turned ON, then YES U need a firewall.
Since Xitami doesn't require "File Sharing" to be turned ON, I don't
see any reason for it. I've had dozens of hackers attack my site
for one reason or another without success.

   Somebody even tested Xitami's integrity by launching Black Widow
against it. Still NO HOLES!!!

   Any Sap, that wants to trust MS software integrity, deserves what
they get!

Try www.dslreports.com and go to the TOOLS section. They'll tell you what
running and what's not. Also check your AUP for information on what's blocked.

Can't it find php.exe or php3.exe?

Maybe you should upgrade to PHP4.1.0, it's a very fast version, and
personally I believe it to be very stable as well.

try this also you do not place your PHP files in the CGI-BIN that is
handled by perl I think just place them in \webpages\php
that may help..

.php = "D:\\php\\php.exe"
    .phtml = "D:\\php\\php.exe"

Phone lines work on the principle of a balanced line transformer issolation 
system, they should NEVER be grounded.  A grounded phone line will have a 
very loud hum.

I agree that the EQUIPMENT should be properly grounded, but not the phone 
line.

Look at your logs and see which browsers every one is using.

It is 8:51 EST right now on Jan/10 and I just connected to your site using 
Opera 5/Linux.  I think your actually problem is that your EMAIL icon is not 
there.  Some browser hang on things like this.   Opera rendered the text then 
locked up for ever waiting for this icon.

I suggest that you, and every one really, run their html code through
HTML Tidy to make sure it is following the standards of the World Wide Web 
Consortium.  Fix up the errors it reports then see if people can get your 
page.

Aren't one minute updates a bit obsessive?  Some Dynamic DNS services would

I just tried to access your site using wget (a CLI program to get 
webpages). Got some interesting results, whihc also partially appear in 
my browser (Mozilla).

First a default page which gets redirected to index.html (ignore the .1 
thats caused by the fact I had an index.html in the wget diretory)

C:\temp\wget>wget http://www.hanleytime.com/
--15:24:41--  http://www.hanleytime.com/
           => `index.html.1'
Connecting to www.hanleytime.com:80... connected!
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK

    0K                                                         0% @   
0.00 B/s

15:27:38 (0.00 B/s) - Read error at byte 0/1979 (No such file or 
directory). Ret
rying.
..
^C

Now an attempt to get a non existant page - standard Xitami error returned

C:\temp\wget>wget http://www.hanleytime.com/index1.html
--15:27:59--  http://www.hanleytime.com/index1.html
           => `index1.html'
Connecting to www.hanleytime.com:80... connected!
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found
15:27:59 ERROR 404: Not Found.

Now an attempt to get a page that exists but with no redirect.
C:\temp\wget>wget http://www.hanleytime.com/index.html
--15:28:03--  http://www.hanleytime.com/index.html
           => `index.html.2'
Connecting to www.hanleytime.com:80... connected!
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK

0.00 B/s

15:28:07 (0.00 B/s) - Read error at byte 0/1979 (No such file or 
directory). Ret
rying.

On the other hand even my browser can download 
http://www.hanleytime.com/images/ and get a webpage with the contents of 
your images subdirectory AND I can also download and view 
http://www.hanleytime.com/images/buttons.gif so it looks like the 
problem is somehow related to .html pages.

Using a really basic perl script that uses IO::Socket, what happens is 
that the socket gets closed abruptly after the header is sent. This 
looks like a OS problem where Xitami is for some reason not able to open 
the file to read it because the error pages are correctly downloaded 
although I suppose it could be a router problem. Given that I can 
download images though I'm really confused

I probably of limited use for testing since I have to go through a proxy 
or 2 to get on the internet so its hard for me to tell exactly what is 
going on...

Francis
PS late breaking news. I just tried to download a different image 
(http://www.hanleytime.com/images/xitami1.gif) and it has stalled.

   I'm not sure that we are talking about the same thing. I'm refering
to the outside lines, not the inside lines. The ones that come in to
the box from off the street. Simple test is pick up your phone
receiver and listen to it. If you here static, then U have a bad
ground. If while U talk to somebody U hear static the cause is a bad
ground more than likely. Like I said the connection coming into your
house, and not the inside line. There should be at least 3 feet of 3/8
inch copper rod driven into the ground for your telephone service
connection, properly secured and tightly fitted to a wire that leads
into your telephone box. If it's connected to a cold water pipe, or
something similar it can cause all kinds of comm problems.

   Since Sprint DSL comes in through your phone line, I can only
assume the same principle applies. I'm a technician, not an engineer
I work according to application, and not theory.

   Who knows, maybe I'm wrong, but then my phone lines, and DSL
work just fine. However, they didn't when I first bought the house
over 10 years ago. I had to have my box tested and serviced by
the tele-co before I got rid of the static. The reason for the test
was because I was using a modem, and was losing the connection
or getting gobbldy gook for IBM-ANSI characters all the time.

I hope this clarifies things..

Are you sure you're using php3 ??? php3 has been out of date for a LONG time
now; if so maybe you should download & install php4 (php.exe & friends) from
www.php.net. Also make sure that your system PATH variable contains the path
to
the php.exe, perferably at the very beginning as Xitami seems to
occasionally
have difficulty locating the main php dll if it is not on the path.

In c:\xitami\xitami.cfg I have the following section:

[Filter]
    .ssi=perlssi                        #   Pass *.ssi to PerlSSI
    .shtm=perlssi                       #   Pass *.shtm to PerlSSI
    .shtml=perlssi                      #   Pass *.shtml to PerlSSI
    .php=C:\PHP\php3.exe

I have php3.exe in C:\PHP.

When I go to a php document I get the following error:
Internal error: your request was unsuccessful
Cannot create CGI process - program not found

It seems to be saying it can't find php.exe!

Any ideas what I have missed?  I tried changing the reference to
c:\php\php3.exe in case there is case thing going on but it made no
difference.

I am not sure that the problem is not much more simple than everyone has
made it, as it has been a couple of days since the original post, and I am
able to connect just fine.  I have had similar problems as I have had other
companies host my sites up until recently.  In trying to find a good
provider, I often moved my site.

I found DNS updating to be a long and slow process.  It always seemed that
within  2 days or so of pointing my Domain at a host IP, half of the
internet could connect to my site, and half couldn't.  It often took more
than 2 weeks before I could trace route my site from servers everwhere (you
can do this at www.tracert.com).

If you have just recently set up your server, and pointed your domain at
your dynamic ISP service, be patient.  I know its very frustrating.  Within
a couple of weeks everyone will probably be able to connect to your site.

Good Luck,

Jay Aldrich

There is no email icon. It's just an underlined link that opens the email
client and fills in the To:

I did not write the code. It is automatically generated by the Legacy 3.0
software.

I can try replacing the main page and have a link go to the index.htm file.

Look at your logs and see which browsers every one is using.

It is 8:51 EST right now on Jan/10 and I just connected to your site using
Opera 5/Linux.  I think your actually problem is that your EMAIL icon is not
there.  Some browser hang on things like this.   Opera rendered the text
then
locked up for ever waiting for this icon.

I suggest that you, and every one really, run their html code through
HTML Tidy to make sure it is following the standards of the World Wide Web
Consortium.  Fix up the errors it reports then see if people can get your
page.

Aren't one minute updates a bit obsessive?  Some Dynamic DNS services would
ban you for doing that.  You should only need to do them when the link comes
up.

No not coldfusion! Xifusion, as its just a small pass through program anyway
and that's probably the issue.
Coldfusion source, good grief!

Would be nice though. :>

Anybody know if Xifusion works to allow ColdFusion Server Pro and Xitami to
talk? 

I know it works with ColdFusion Express 4.5 and Xitami because that's what
it was initially tested under.

Thanks ahead of time.

Yep. You need to add it as a filter in xitami.cfg

Looks like this:

Yeah, no kidding! :-) You seem to know a bit about this. What am I doing
wrong
with win2k? Is there a win2k version of Xifusion someplace?

Thanks.  I assume you could run ColdFusion Pro 5 with Xitami under Win98
but not under Win2k.  Best to ask this question of the Xifusion author,
Thomas Hruska.

His site is at http://www.shininglightpro.com/ and the current version of
Xifusion is 2.5.

He still has not officially indicated anywhere online what OS versions and
ColdFusion versions Xifusion v2.5 has been tested under.  Maybe you could
fire off an email to him at  thruska@css.tayloru.edu

I will not upgrade to Win2k unless you verify that the combination works, -
just in case.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitmami / cdrom / No network or TCPIP?
Message-ID: <COEAJMCINDEAAHLGNCEMGEBACDAA.robert.bowen@mubimedia.com>

Hello all. Hoping someone out there can give me a hand.

I am trying to transfer an entire web site to cdrom. Within the site there
are a few searches which basically open and parse data files, and then
dynamically generate html pages, using perl.

Can I do this with Xitami? I know that most any web server these days is
capable of cgi, including Xitami. But can it do it, having the web site,
xitami server and perl, all living on a cd, without tcpip?

I have tried this with MicroWeb and it works perfectly, but if tcp/ip is not
installed it doesn't work. I know what you are thinking -- "Who DOESN'T have
TCP/IP installed these days?" Unfortunately we can't insist that the 350,000
potential users of this cd have tcp/ip installed. Many wouldn't even know
what it is, let alone why they need it to browse a cd ...

Any help *MUCH* appreciated!

Bob

Short answer is, no..

Xitami requires TCP/IP also.

Have you configured Xitami to think that "/scripts/" indicates your
cgi-bin directory?  If not, then it'll never try to run the program,
and just send it to the browser.

No.  Xitami, and pretty much every other webserver I'm aware of uses
tcp/ip as it's transport protocol, and hence won't work if it isn't
installed.

ISTR that Dr Dobbs did something a year or two back with a Java applet
that did the searching which would work without a webserver, for much
this sort of context.  Might be worth digging around their site to see
if you can find anything.

If you can live with Windows only it may be possible to do something
with an ActiveX control.

Then again I'm not even sure it is possible to install a web browser
like IE or Netscape without TCP/IP installed.

You can make a cd rom that start window internet explorer automatically and 
loads an index page. (TCP/IP is not needed since only local files are accessed)
 From there on the users can navigate the CD like a normal internet site.
It will not be possible to execute programs, but IE has a FIND function.
There are also javascripts commands that let you select records in a file. 
Normally these commands are not used in an internet environment, since the 
whole file has to be downloaded anyway, but they function well for local 
browsing.

I regularly distribute CD-ROMS that way, and i never had complains that the 
files could not be read.
Of course the CD-ROM will only be accessible by windows PC's.

Simply make a "autorun.inf" file in the root of the CD with following content:

[autorun]
open=start index.htm

(assuming index.htm is also in the root of the CD)

As others have said this isn't really a web server problem its more a 
browser problem. If you were willing to investigate the possibility of 
distributing the mozilla browser on your CD then you could look at 
including protozilla as a way to run a kind of "client side" CGI. 
However I suspect its easier to assume a TCPIP stack.

If interested take a look at http://protozilla.mozdev.org/ and an 
article at http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=4724&mode=thread&order=0

Also bear in mind this is definitely beta code at present

It's impossible to run a 'live' site with CGIs and Perl without 
TCP/IP.  However, you can probably make a CD-ROM that everyone can 
use if you bend the rules a little.

First, create a start page that is entirely static.  Anyone with a 
browser, with or without TCP/IP, will be able to access this.  If you 
have dynamic output on the first page, cheat by pregenerating 
something that will show without HTTP access.  Then, make as much of 
the site work in static HTML and make it clear that the rest of the 
site is only available to people who have TCP/IP installed (which is 
frankly trivial on all Windows platforms from 95 upwards, even if it 
simply means installing dial-up networking).

You will also need to start Xitami in the background.  You can 
probably do this using the autorun.inf file.

It could be a lot of things. In any case, in the USA, phone grounding is the
PHONE COMPANY'S job, not the customer's job. If you hear hum or static, bypass
your inside wiring by plugging into the box where the phone line comes into
the house. (If you don't have the modern kind of telco entrance box, call the
phone company and demand one: they are very much better than the old carbon
block protectors, and easier to diagnose.) If you have hum inside but not at
the box, fix (preferably re-run) your inside wires. If you have hum at the
outside box, MAKE the telco fix it. There may be larger safety issues. 

> There should be at least 3 feet of 3/8 inch copper rod driven into the ground for your telephone 

A dirt rod, especially a little 3-foot, is almost worthless in most US soils.
It has a resistance as high as the phone line. A dirt rod is no longer allowed
to be a home's only power ground, and it isn't allowed for power and phone to
"share" a dirt rod (that becomes exceptionally dangerous in lightning or when
a 13,000/240 power transformer shorts). 

If that fixed your problems, I guess you better leave it alone. But I wouldn't
like it, my phone company would be upset, and the electrical inspector
probably should be consulted. Home grounding has become complex lately; the
best rule is "it is usually done wrong". 

> If it's connected to a cold water pipe, or something similar it can cause all kinds of comm problems.

Until plastic pipe became common, the water system was the same as a dirt rod
(it goes through the same dirt!) except VERY much better, being miles long and
typically wet from seepage in the mains. In my area, the telco always
connected to a metal water pipe: even had a standard clamp and "WARNING" tag
for the purpose. That should do no harm; though with modern plastic pipe it
may do no good. (My inside pipe is copper but I discovered that it turns to
plastic a foot outside the cellar, so I get no benefit from the water mains
system.) 

"Your" side of the telco entrance point should be UNgrounded. The wires
"should" be correctly grounded (through protector blocks which don't ground
the normal signals) by the telco. Most telcos are pretty good about this: if a
home phone is improperly grounded, THEIR workers are in danger. 

If you have static, call and complain. Many telcos don't want to hear about
modems, and may have lax standards for voice quality. But if you say you hear
static AND your fax machine prints garbage and drops the connection, they will
often do something about it.

I'm using Win2000 Professional right now with XiFusion v2.5 and ColdFusion
Express v4.5.  This combination works fine.

However, CF 5 Pro/Ent is yet untested.  I plan on testing this after I get
v2.6 to work.  (XiFusion v2.6 which will address several issues that have
risen since v2.5).

Sorry about the late response - I've been through the painstaking process

process, I forgot to subscribe myself to this list...ho hum :P

Duh!

You seem to have a problem too!  Addresses in the range [192.168.0.0] to
[192.168.255.255] are PRIVATE ones, which are explicitly not routable.
(See RFC-1918.)

If you're getting a reply to the ping, then YOUR network must have a
machine with the identity [192.168.1.5] --- it goes nowhere near Spyman's
system

You also have another problem, in that you've failed to excise anything
from Spyman's message: you ought to quote only sufficient to provide a
background for your reply, so really the precepts applicable to news will
work: <http://www.geocities.com/nnqweb/nquote.html> provides good

All,

I just installed PHP 4.1.0 on my Xitami box, and I was getting the same
errors as the previous posters of this thread had mentioned: some error
message in the browser window about not being able to find the executable.

Well, I found a solution that may be of help. When I tried to run a sample
script at the command line, I got an error dialog box which said it was
unable to locate obdc32.dll. I checked around for this file on another
machine, found it, copied it over to c:\windows\system (this is a win98 box)
and tried the sample script again. Now it complained about missing another
DLL (its name escapes me right now.) I also copied it over and tried the
sample script one more time.

Bingo!

A check on the PHP site for these missing dll files indicates that these
missing files can be a problem - not very common, but it does happen. Other
users reported installing the free version of MySQL solved the problem - it
must have the right DLLs.

Anyway, its all working now, and I'm ready to start learning PHP. I just
thought I would share my experience.

I've been this route, tho at the time I using TinyWeb, had not learned of 
Xitami yet.  I would never try to do this again, it didn't work.

People didn't understand that they needed this web server running.  Some 
programs thought that it was a virus, or a Back-Orfice kind of spy program.

Some one else complained about the resources that the server where being 
used.  Even when all of the software was removed they STILL complained that 
it was the web servers fault that their resources where low.

I ended up writing my own "browser" that would read the HTML files, using 
the wxWindows tool kit, http://www.wxwindows.org/ .  Every one seems happy 
with that.

Gunnar,

Thanks for the link. Of course, I know that copying files is not normally a
hot way to go for such things, and frankly, I didn't expect it to work
anyway.

I'll do a Ghost backup, install the MDAC kit, and if there are any problems,
I'll report back here.

If using mySQL ... use their ODBC installer after installing MDAC.

I'd prefer it if the original poster didn't use something as

Not 'Bingo'...doing that can cause *serious* problems and possibly even
destroy a working OS (even Linux can't stand up to changes like that if not
done properly and will crash if such changes are made foolishly).

The correct way to get the odbc32.dll (and other related drivers) onto your
system is to go to <http://www.microsoft.com/odbc/> and download the latest
ODBC drivers from there.  Be sure to update your Jet drivers (which you
probably don't have installed since ODBC isn't installed) as well in case
you ever do anything with databases.

Only in rare (and I mean *REALLY* rare) circumstances is copying DLLs a
good idea.  Most DLLs and applications need to be registered with the OS
via the registry.  Copying files over doesn't add the needed entries to the
registry and if you attempt to use any of the ODBC functions in PHP, PHP
will probably crash or will return garbage (and if it crashes, the system
will probably become unstable).

I highly recommend installing ODBC correctly to help keep your system stable.

Hope this helps!

No, the HTML directory is website (the folder name for my website), but the

It'd get real messy having my website one place and my scripts another, is

As far as I know your cgi-bin dir should be
in the Xitami folder.
I.e.

 Xitami/Website/
Xitami/cgi-bin

Intresting! Where did it know from that the file length will be 1979?
I've got this (debug enabled trace with wget):

>wget -d www.hanleytime.com
DEBUG output created by Wget 1.7 on linux-gnu.

parseurl ("www.hanleytime.com") -> host www.hanleytime.com -> opath  ->

... still waiting :)

The current DNS record is:
www.hanleytime.com      A       216.175.64.191

So I get connected, Xitami knows the file's type, timestamp and length.
But why is it neither sent nor read error stated?

Hope this helps,
Laszlo

It appears that Xitami might not have permissions to access the file or
some sort of really bizarre firewall is preventing the data from going
through.  Now I'm not sure how Xitami does this, but it is possible to
attain file information without opening the file (verifies that it exists).
 So, the permissions might be set up such that Xitami can get the file
information (size, etc.) and return it but not be able to open and read the
file.

One other, however highly unlikely, possibility is a corrupt Xitami
installation (TCP/IP stack or OS installation?)

Hope this helps!

Hello all,

I got the following message from a viewer of my site:

He suggests (in dutch): That's a strange content-type, shouldn't you
set the content-type for .css to "text/css"

I would like to, so how do I change content-type for .css in Xitami?

Add:

[Mime]
   css=text/css

to defaults.cfg and restart Xitami.

Thomas, did you ever test Xifusion 2.5 with Win2000 and ColdFusion Pro 5?
There were some questions a few days back.

Also, I have Xifusion 2.5 up with ColdFusion Express 4.5 under WinNT and
have high hopes for using it for learning and some small projects but if I
upgrade to Win2000 I don't know what will happen.

No, I haven't tested XiFusion with CF Pro 5.  However, it works with
CFExpress 4.5 and, if I remember correctly, 5.0 isn't that much different
on the CGI end of things.

XiFusion v2.6 will be tested with Win2000 and CF Pro/Ent 5.

Hope this helps!

It knows the length because one of th eheaders is the Content-length: field
Unfortunately what seems to happen is Xitami serves up the headers and 
then stops

I use an "off site" web counter www.webcounter.com that is free if you have
hits below a certain amount.  The only problem is that it takes longer to
load than if it were "on site."

Just my 2 Cents worth.

I use a PHP counter on my website

http://dewdude.ath.cx

I'm using the Win32 executable and as long as PHP is on your system,
it'll run on ANY platform.

I second that counter.

For an example, go to http://www.vanarts.com which
is on a Xitami server.  The counter at the bottom of the Home Page points
to my Xitami cgi-bin count.exe which is version 2.5 from
http://muquit.com/muquit/software/Count/Count.html

Note that you can use
custom digits, unlike link-to counters.  I have made digits in PaintShop
from GIF images and even from photo JPG images.

Message-ID: <LKBBKLDHICNIAKJMKNCEGELEDLAA.warren@warrenernst.com>

I am trying to set up NOCC, a web based email PHP script.

It has a line in its configuration files that says:

// Base URL where NOCC is hosted (only needed for Xitami servers, see
#463390)
$base_uri = '';


Ignoring that url is spelled "uri", I'm not sure what this note means.

I have the files located in c:\xitami\webpages\nocc, if that means anything.

Anyone know where to go with this?

URI is a broader form, so it is correct.

Then that is what you set base_uri to:

  $base_uri = 'c:/xitami/webpages/nocc/';

Note, you may have to drop the trailing / I can't remember off-hand if it is
needed or not.

It is used for page redirection.

Dear Craig Morrison

Excuse me, but I don't understood your reply below.
I am a beginner in Xitami Lists.
My Question is:

I have WebServer Xitami v. 2.5b4 and DNS2go Client from Deerfield.com,
both into my Computer (Drive C), with win 98, and URL SubDomain and
Host Address: http://www.raichel.d2g.com in WebServer.
I put in my computer a FTP Program (default port=21), for Upload files
(Binary and ASCII mode), from Forum Software to folders of Xitami.

It may NOT be misspelt: since 1994, the official terminology (see
RFC-1630) has been Universal Resource Identifier (URI), and /not/
Universal Resource Locator (URL).

Considering that probably more than 90% of the present-day users of the
Internet have come to it since that date, it's surprising that everyone
uses a term that was already officially obsolete when they joined.  I
suspect that we must blame those responsible for programs such as
Nutscrape & Internet Exploder who did nothing to promulgate the official
nomenclature.

Message-ID: <64DB6640B57B4C4B97F5E2A7902494170AB3E5@cawhqexch01.caw.com>

Hello All...

I use a Xitami LRWP to implement a light weight embedded GUI.
Im at the point where I want to implement a multi user version
of the interface and need to manage session context.  Are there Xitami
addons that support session management.

Ideally when a user is logged on and navigating the GUI, a second user
could log in and do the same.  Supporting this will require management
of 
each user session.

Any thought or ideas about this?

thx

I currently have 11 domains running and I am trying to set up a webcam using

Sometimes, I saw PHPlib with great support for user authentication and
session management (both with cookies and uri ;) references). Now, it is
on the SourceForge. It was started in PHP3 but I don't really know if this
is a restriction (I'm sure there are many other toolkits out there).

Well, you could always use a script to redirect to port 8080.  Here's a
quickie PHP script that will do the trick:

<?
  header("Location: http://webcam.<domain>.com:8080/");
?>


Hope this helps!

[I've cc'd this answer to xitami-dev, where this discussion can 
continue.]

We've done this before... long time back we wrote a session 
management layer for Xitami.  It was part of our WTP protocol 
handler, a kind of large-scale LRWP manager that we built for our 
Studio toolkit.

WTP is a bit like LRWP but more complex.  We wrote our Studio 
application programs using Libero and the same form i/o system that 
comes with Xitami's administration SDK.  Studio has been static for a 
while and I've now put it into our public CVS archive.

This should be available from:

    http://cvs.imatix.com./cgi-bin/viewcvs/

when the site has been mirrored, which will happen some time today.

Check the OpenKernel Studio directory.  I can't guarantee that Studio 
will make sense or even build.  You will have to be ready to build 
your own version of Xitami (it uses a WSX plugin).

Hopefully someone can help.
I am having a problem with form uploads on the server side.  I am fairly
confident that I have the form correct, but I cannot find where it is on the
server.  I see that the CONTENT_LENGTH enviroment variable tells me that the
file got to the server, but where its location remains a mystery to me.  I
have tried reading in the information myself using the standard in (STDIN)
but that will only work if the file is all text.  I have tried load the cgi
pipe files in xitami/temp but they do not seem to be there when I try to
load them.  Does someone know?

What language/compiler are you using to write the CGI that does this?

Reading from STDIN is the correct procedure, you just have to make sure the
stream is in binary mode.

The compiler I am using is perl.  Binary mode!  Of course, that might just
be it.  Thank you.

No I don't think so (it's a PHP thing) -- but there are similar routines
in CGI.pm that work quite well.

As you noted in an earlier mesage, the main thing is that to read binary
files you'll have to tell Perl to access stdin in binary mode (there is
a function to do this).  Then it should work fine.  Although the CGI.pm
interface is easier -- just have a look through the CGI.pm documentation
for details on handling file uploads.

I guess it's time to learn PHP. I have no idea what to do with this. I'll
start doing some research on this but in the mean time...

Where do I need to put it to redirect webcam.domain.com to port 8080?

Well, you could always use a script to redirect to port 8080.  Here's a
quickie PHP script that will do the trick:

<?
  header("Location: http://webcam.<domain>.com:8080/");
?>


Hope this helps!

	You can do redirects with regular html, you don't need PHP.

	If you save this file to index.html:


<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<META content="text/html; charset=unicode" http-equiv=Content-Type>
<META content="MSHTML 5.00.2614.3500" name=GENERATOR></HEAD>
<BODY onload="window.location='index.php'"></BODY></HTML>


	and visit it with a browser, it will try to redirect to 'index.php' on the same
host. Just put what you need in there, instead of 'index.php'.


	I am not claiming this is an answer to your original question, I am just saying
you can redirect without having to learn/install PHP.

	You are getting a PHP error, I sent a tip that does not involve PHP at all. You
must have replied to the wrong msg.

	Now, back to your PHP header problem below, the header line has to be the 1st
line of PHP code to run. Actually it has to be the 1st one that generates
output, but it is usually a good rule of thumb to put it as the 1st line of
code, even before you generate <html> etc etc.

	Just read the PHP manual, about the header function.

I think we are a little off track here. The problem is that
webcam.ackerman-family.com points to port 80 via the DNS. The A record for
ackerman-family.com points to internal IP 192.168.1.3, the CNAME point
www.ackerman-famly.com to ackerman-family.com. So any subdomain that is not
defined in the DNS will go to 192.168.1.3 port 80 (80 is opened on the
router and is what Xitami is set for). So port 8080 will not work. I have
even tried opening port 8080 on the router but you can't specify a port in
dns records (that I know of). I think I can have the DNS server point
webcam.ackerman-family.com to a different IP with an A record to that
effect.

You see why I'm so confused.

Oh I can specify a different port for the webcam, I just can't specify an IP
address.

You can put in a page like www.ackerman-family.com/webcam.html with a meta
redirect to port 8080 something like this:
<META HTTP-EQUIV=Refresh CONTENT="0;
URL=http://webcam.ackerman-family.com:8080/">
Which would point at another copy of Xitami running on port 8080 and
handling the web camera and set that up as a virtual site or in DNS, either
should work. It would probably be easiest to do on a network setup with DNS.
There are many different ways to do this on a network.

That works at least on the server, I think I can work with this. I have some
tweaking to do but at least we are there.

Thanks

You can put in a page like www.ackerman-family.com/webcam.html with a meta
redirect to port 8080 something like this:
<META HTTP-EQUIV=Refresh CONTENT="0;
URL=http://webcam.ackerman-family.com:8080/">
Which would point at another copy of Xitami running on port 8080 and
handling the web camera and set that up as a virtual site or in DNS, either
should work. It would probably be easiest to do on a network setup with DNS.
There are many different ways to do this on a network.

Your confusion is understood, I was there once myself. DNS has nothing to do
with ports, it only serves to translate a name to an IP address. Your router
takes care of port forwarding and translating between external and internal IP
addresses.

With that in mind, open up port 8080 on your router and have it forwarded to
192.168.1.3. Make sure that webcam.ackerman-family.com points to your
_external_ IP (which it does, nslookup reports that).

Then use one of the redirection techniques that have been suggested on the
list. The following type of redirection will be supported by most modern
browsers (and doesn't require JavaScript):

<META HTTP-EQUIV=Refresh CONTENT="0;
URL=http://webcam.ackerman-family.com:8080/">

Just make sure you place it in the <head> section of your HTML document.

To get to the document, all depends on whether you have virtual domains setup
or not.

If you don't, you just need to create an HTML document with the above in it
and place it in your webpages folder. Which means you'll need a link of some
kind on another page to get to it.

Personally what I would do is put the above in a basic HTML document and save
it as index.html in a folder off the webpages folder, say 'webcam'. So you
would end up with:

\xitami\webpages\webcam

Which could be used as the [Server]webpages entry in the cfg file for a
virtual domain.

Does that help any?

Way off track. 

> The problem is that webcam.ackerman-family.com points to port 80 via the DNS. 

Well, no, it doesn't point to port 80; DNS isn't about ports.
Port 80 is assumed by every web browser ever made; but they can
be told to use another port with a URL like domain.com:8080

Therefore your webcam "should" now be working at
http://www.ackerman-family.com:8080

However I get no response. You may have the webcam turned-off at
the moment I tried, or you may be mucking around with overly
complex redirections. And you MUST open port 8080 in your router
or this is never going to work. 

Granted, telling your kin to use :port notation is going to
baffle everybody over age 16. You need a plain URL. 

Is there a reason you want a unique machine name for your webcam?
Or would it be good enough to have a URL like
http://www.ackerman-family.com/webcam ? Webcams are often
embedded in static pages where you can show static info related
to the webcam. 

On that page, have an "image" link like IMG
SRC="http://www.ackerman-family.com:8080" -- however, I'm not
sure that format will work, and can't test it since I can't get
any response from port 8080 at your URL.

Depending on your DNS provider, you may be able todo a Web Forward, like:
http://webcam.ackerman-family.com would actually just forward you to
http://www.ackerman-family.com:8080  I use http://www.zonedit.com for my

I know that is what I said but it wasn't what I meant. Yeah that is true dns
has nothing to do with ports and you know now that I think about it I don't
have port 8080 turned on for forwarding on the router. Sometimes one misses
the obvious. Give it a try now.

Your confusion is understood, I was there once myself. DNS has nothing to do

takes care of port forwarding and translating between external and internal
IP
addresses.

With that in mind, open up port 8080 on your router and have it forwarded to
192.168.1.3. Make sure that webcam.ackerman-family.com points to your
_external_ IP (which it does, nslookup reports that).

<META HTTP-EQUIV=Refresh CONTENT="0;

Just make sure you place it in the <head> section of your HTML document.

To get to the document, all depends on whether you have virtual domains
setup
or not.

If you don't, you just need to create an HTML document with the above in it
and place it in your webpages folder. Which means you'll need a link of some

Which could be used as the [Server]webpages entry in the cfg file for a
virtual domain.

Does that help any?

I am not sure that the problem is not much more simple than everyone has
made it, as it has been a couple of days since the original post, and I am
able to connect just fine.  I have had similar problems as I have had other
companies host my sites up until recently.  In trying to find a good
provider, I often moved my site.

I found DNS updating to be a long and slow process.  It always seemed that
within  2 days or so of pointing my Domain at a host IP, half of the
internet could connect to my site, and half couldn't.  It often took more
than 2 weeks before I could trace route my site from servers everwhere (you
can do this at www.tracert.com).

If you have just recently set up your server, and pointed your domain at
your dynamic ISP service, be patient.  I know its very frustrating.  Within
a couple of weeks everyone will probably be able to connect to your site.

Good Luck,

Jay Aldrich

I doubt you'll get an answer here, since it sounds like you have Xitami set up
correctly.

Craig,

That seems to be the problem site.

11   191 ms    70 ms    60 ms  redback-1-e2-0.atl2.mindspring.net

The next hop is my computer. (hop 12 for you)

I tried about 25-30 sites from www.tracert.com and 1 or two hung up there.
But all the rest make it to the next hop.

The rest made it through your hop 11.

So I should try Mindspring (my DSL provider)?

Thanks...

I would have to agree with Craig on those results.  It appears that the DNSs
are routing the requests properly.  They appear to be somehow getting caught
up in the mindspring network.  It seems that a call to mindspring would be
in order.

Good luck,

Jay Aldrich

PS I saw earlier that you said you are using a dynamic IP.  I also currently
use a dynamic IP through RoadRunner.  The policies are probably the same as
they are both unfortunately AOL/Time Warner,  but I suggest you read your
Fair Usage Agreement before you call them so you can word your support
requests properly.  I always tell Roadrunner that I do this for my personal
use so that I can quickly access stuff from my home computer while I am on
the road.

They're automatically added by the mailing list software; and can't easily
be moved.  Most mail readers can be configured to display only selected
headers on each message; or not to display selected headers of a
message.  (I typically only display From/To/Subject/Date by default.)

	I'm running Xotami under WinNT 4 (and a friend is running it under Win98SE). 
Everything works fine locally, the cd rom gets accessed and the data is available....until 
you connect in from the Net. Then it is a 404, the url can't be found.

	I'm also using a Dynamic DNS (Hammer Node)

	The site index.html is in /webpages and it is directed by .html to the cdrom (E:\) 
and refuses to see it or loses it when trying to access it.

	I have been able to access the drives through ftp and transfer data from them. 
I have changed Aliases and .html's until my fingers are ready to fall off <LOL>.

	Can someone give me a Dummies explanation of what Xitami needs in order to 
access the cdrom?

	Thanks in advance,

On the html page are the links constructed as ftp:// or http://

If /webpages is your root folder for your site, can any http access be
outside of that root folder?  It could be that if the links are accessed via
http the link could not access outside of your /webpages folder.  Just a
thought.

Eudora, in both version 1.4 (my wife still uses that!) and in
version 4 (a buddy uses that) can hide most headers. I assume
that 3.0.6 can too. 

They used to call the option "Show all headers (even ugly ones)".
I suspect you want to toggle that option OFF, so you don't see
ugly headers. (This list-bot is not the worst I've seen for
flooding the header space.) 

NetScape gives me a 3 way choice. 99% of the time I keep it in
the least-header mode. I turn on All headers only when debugging
clients' emails or tracing spammers.

Message-ID: <FB7624FAD451064B9C4E74A807AC7027989C14@ex2000.forus.netpower.no>

I'm not a specialist, but this is how I'm doing this. I currently host about 10 domains on a single IP using the xitami web server.

First of all you need to "point" you domain to the "209.5.45.142" IP in your nameserver, or get your ISP to do this for you.

Then I use the xitami web interface to add a virtual host (click the "virtual host" button and select "new")

1. Enter a name for the ".cfg" file at the top (any name)
2. Select "All addresses" in the IP Address field.
3. Enter your domain name in the DNS field
4. Enter the full path of the location of the web pages.
5. Click the "create" button at the bottom
6. Restart the web server

Finished!

hope this helps!!

	Hi Peter, thanks for the reply...it got me thinking in a different direction and I 
was able to solve the problem. I've got a couple of small glitches left, but those are html 
problems.

	In case you want to add this to the "Xitami For Dummies" book, here's what I 
did.

	I went back and renamed the Xitami.cfg (actually did a copy and rename) to 
defaults. cfg and base host.cfg. Changed the location of the .aut files and rewrote the 
.cfg's to reflect my web site. (After all why reinvent the wheel, modify it!<LOL>) Among the 
changes,I changed the aliases to 
		(first column)	(second column-path)
		 cdrom        		E:\
		cdrom1			F:\

	I could have called them Moe and Larry or anything else, it doesn't matter. 
Also, if the drive was multi partioned, I could have used the same setup.

	Next in my Index.html, I addressed the drives as cdrom or cdrom1. This Xitami 
understood and took me right to the drive I wanted. I found that the .html could be written 
as ;
	<a href="http://the-beast.hn.org/cdrom/main-index.html"></a>
			or
	<a href="cdrom/main-index.html"></a> 
	(NB: Neither line specifies the drive by a letter only as cdrom) I decided to use 
the shorter of the two, I'm lazy.

	Then from another system I went out on the web and tested it and it worked 
fine.

	So I have to thank you again for at least getting me out of the cycle of how to 
address drive E:\...it was getting very frustrating. Sort of like the old BBS days. The 
standing joke was everything worked locally, but not remotely. <LOL>....

	Hope this helps someone else in the future and if there's anyone with some 
more tips for using externals, I'd love to hear from them.

It means that some moron running IIS has allowed his system to be
infected by one of a number of viruses (CodeRed, Nimda, etc) which then
probe the IP address space looking for other idiots also running
unprotected versions of IIS, so that they can infect them also.

It won't hurt Xitami, although if the volume is excessive you might not
like the continuing expansion of your log file.  I would suggest
identifying the ISP(s) of the connecting machine(s) so that you can tell
them, and they in turn can inform their customer.

Someone is attempting to make use of an IIS exploit (or CodeRed/Nimda/etc 
infection; I forget which that exact one is).  Xitami isn't vulnerable
to these, and is saying "not here" in reply to them.  But generally all
the programs trying these automatically don't check for IIS, etc, they
just try the exploit out anyway.

So I setup two hots, each are working perfectly fine.  I want to limit one of the hosts while allowing the other full use of my bandwidth.  Well when the WBA comes up for the hosts they don't have the http throttle option available.  Nor do they have the option to limit the number of number of connections to the server.  Anyone know why this might happen with the hosts?  Every other detail about the configuration can be changed so I don't understand whats happening.  Thanks the help ahead of time, Jesse Foster

Subject: [Xitami] I'm to stupid: Virtual Hosts
Message-ID: <NCBBLHNNKNPMOBPMIBDHCEHCOLAA.robert.muench@robertmuench.de>

Hi, I'm really sorry for this post but I can't find out why my virtual hosts are
not working. Here is my configuration:

1. I have a xitami.cfg and a defaults.cfg file. So IMO Xitami uses the
defaults.cfg file. My defaults.cfg file looks like this:

#*END

[Security]
    Filename = "defaults.aut"

[Server]
    Cgi-bin = "/var/www/cgi-bin"
    Debug = "1"
    Default1 = "index.html"
    Default2 = "default.html"
    Webpages = "/var/www/html"

[Virtual-hosts]
    Www.infolayer.com = "infolayer.cfg"

There you see the virtual hosts entry. And the infolayer.cfg file looks like
this:

#*END

[Accesslog]
    Filename = "infolayer.log"

[Ftp]
    Root = "/var/www/html/infolayer"

[Security]
    Filename = "infolayer.aut"
    Superuser = "fischer.infolayer"

[Server]
    Cgi-bin = "/var/www/cgi-bin"
    Default1 = "index.html"
    Default2 = "default.html"
    Webpages = "/var/www/html/infolayer"

The problem is that the web-page from /var/www/html is being displayed and not
the one from /var/www/html/infolayer any idea where the problem could be?

Don't sent [Server] webpages in defaults.cfg; due to a bug in Xitami it
will override every other webpages definition.  Set it in basehost.cfg
for the base one, and then in each virtual host instead.

Hi, ;-) well I'm happy that it was something you have to know, thanks... what
about the Cgi-bin directive? Should it go from default.cfg to basehost.cfg as
well? Robert

No.  It's a bug that's specific to the handling of the wwebpages
directive (caused by an issue in trying to allow the webpages directory
to be set from the command line).

Subject: [Xitami] problems with xibuild under OpenBSD
Message-ID: <3C4CDF8E.F5ADE35A@videotron.ca>

I am unable to get xibuild to work under OpenBSD, it appears OpenBSD makes use
of an "ar" (object librarian) program of a different lineage than do linux, and
freebsd, and refuses to do its job if the 's' switch is used.

The man page leads me to believe that ranlib can do the job of a reluctant ar
program. My question is what is the right way to modify your build setups to
accomodate this?

Here is a screen copy.

$ ./xibuild
chmod: /home/greg/xitami-25b5/src/sfl/c: Operation not permitted
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Xitami web server, copyright (c) 1991-99 iMatix.

OpenBSD system.  Nothing is installed in any system directories.
Please confirm this information:
    System . . . . . .: OpenBSD
    ANSI C compiler. .: cc -c  -DDEBUG

If the ANSI C compile command is wrong, you will have to modify the
'c' scripts in these directories:

    /home/greg/xitami-25b5/src/sfl, /home/greg/xitami-25b5/src/smt

If this information looks okay, press [Enter] to build Xitami.

It goes on and on like this for each source file.

IIRC "ar s" is a SysVism that the GNU tools also have.  OpenBSD is a BSD
true'n'true, and they tend to use ranlib instead.

The "c" compile script will support this, and it is controlled by the
"RANLIB" variable in the script.  The existing script has an entry for
FreeBSD which does basically this; you probably want to make that one
match OpenBSD too (and presumably NetBSD).

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami on OpenBSD chapter 2...
Message-ID: <3C4F836B.A5A74F90@videotron.ca>

Thanks for the help. I am getting closer, but not quite there yet.

Following your message, I created a '.c.conf' file that has RANLIB=1,
reducing, but not eliminating the problem of errors when building.

xibuild: Rebuilding the SFL package...
Building the iMatix Standard Function Library
Press [Enter] to continue, or Ctrl-C to abort.
Checking for required files...
this is c.conf seting up parameters for the imatix c procedure     <- (my
comment in .c.conf)
Compiling sflbits...
this is c.conf seting up parameters for the imatix c procedure
ar: creating archive libsfl.a
ar: sflbits.o;: No such file or directory
ar: ranlib: No such file or directory
this is c.conf seting up parameters for the imatix c procedure
Compiling sflhttp...

It looks like the 'build' script is still not feeding the right parameters into
the
'c' (compile) script. I think the .o is missing off of the name of the object
files.

Could it be that I need to regenerate the 'build' scripts? How?

For some reason it appears that the file name is being seen as "sflbits.o;"
which isn't right, and that "ranlib" is being seen as an argument to the
ar command, which also isn't right (ranlib is a command in its own
right).

The command line ought to look something like:

ar r libsfl.a sflbits.o; ranlib libsfl.a

but from the errors that you show it seems like it looks something like
this:

ar r libsfl.a "sflbits.o;" ranlib libsfl.a

which won't work.

I'd suggest finding the line in the script calling "ar", and adding some
echos before it to display what it is running; a common thing that I do
is copy the line and add echo " before it, and " after it. (Although in
this instance that may not show exactly what we want, but it should
point you in the right direction.)

>Could it be that I need to regenerate the 'build' scripts? How?

The error that you show is clearly within the "c" script (which handles
adding the right suffixes to things as it goes), so you don't need to
rebuild the other build scripts.  (Unlike, say, automake/autoconf, the
Makefiles that are generated by otto are pretty generic, with all the
customisation handled in the "c" compile script.)

Xitami has a directory called private
you can add user and names in the
defaults.aut under
[Private]
    USER=PASSWORD
so http://yourdomain.com/private/
will get you what you want not sure
about CGI and things they should
be normal
hope this helped

I'm not sure I understand appropriately but..

I assume your router does Network Address Translation (NAT). So, the
address at the external end of the router will be forwarded (and
translated) to your machine behind onto the address given by the router.
When you open a connection to the address of your router it will end in
your machine whatever IP address it has got.

Furthermore, You can make any program (and Xitami also) to listen on all
of your interfaces online (ethernet, local:127.0.0.1, ...) pointing it to
0.0.0.0

Hope this helps

Message-ID: <20020124072662.SM00301@there>


I'm running Xitami on my Linux box, I wanted to try out some PHP scripts and 
I got the following, can some one transliate what it might mean for Xitami 
since it seems to be written fro Apache?:

"Security Alert! PHP CGI cannot be accessed directly.
This PHP CGI binary was compiled with force-cgi-redirect enabled.  This
means that a page will only be served up if the REDIRECT_STATUS CGI variable 
is set.  This variable is set, for example, by Apache's Action directive 
redirect.

You may disable this restriction by recompiling the PHP binary with the
--disable-force-cgi-redirect switch.  If you do this and you have your PHP CGI
binary accessible somewhere in your web tree, people will be able to 
circumvent .htaccess security by loading files through the PHP parser.  A 
good way around this is to define doc_root in your php.ini file to something 
other than your top-level DOCUMENT_ROOT.  This way you can separate the part 
of your web space which uses PHP from the normal part using .htaccess 
security.  If you do not have any .htaccess restrictions anywhere on your 
site you can leave doc_root undefined."

This probably suggests that you were, at one time, running PHP from Apache.
 Apache sets the REDIRECT_STATUS CGI variable when it executes the PHP
binary.  You have two options:

1)  Recompile the PHP binary by following the rest of the directions.  This
may or may not be acceptable depending on whether other users on the system
are allowed to use PHP from the command-line.

2)  Create a wrapper program/Perl script for PHP that sets the
REDIRECT_STATUS environment variable.  Then point Xitami at the wrapper
program instead of at PHP.

Hope this helps!

How can I remove what is left of the original installation? Have searched

Try manually deleting the remaining files from your hard drive (or move
them to a different directory).

Hope this helps!

Message-ID: <16U5tP-0fbsqeC@fmrl02.sul.t-online.com>

Hi everyone,

I am running Xitami on a Win2k machine forthe purpose of testing
websites I develop and have now installed Xitami 2.4d9, with php 4.1
and also mySQL.

Having had to re-install (with re-format) Win2k, I forgot to make a
copy (or at least a "mental image" :-) ...) of the entries in the
"hosts" file ... where the various virtual hosts and their respective
*.cfg files were each listed on a separate line ...  
(I know ... how could I have been so much in a hurry and not think of
backing this file up ... :-(  :-(  ...)

Can someone please quickly help my memory on the syntax of what each
line should look like ? 
I think it should be something like 

127.0.0.1 www.domain.com ... ??????? (here then is the trouble)

Any help is much appreciated. Thanks!
God bless you with His grace and peace 
Wolfgang

Instead of adding anything after the domain name, there should not be

	Avoid weird characters like spaces, underscores etc in file names.

	Now, if you are asking how to have a CGI obtain the original value without the
%s, that will depend on your CGI tools (PHP, Perl, etc)

I'm making an assumtion here so correct me if I am wrong ...
I am assumming you already have http://domain.com working with Xitami.

You can use a virtual host to do this if you like....
As long as you are looking for it to point to the same machine.
from the administration utility select virtual hosts, new, enter a config
name, enter the url something.domain.com on the DNS entry line
and point to the respective directories to point to.

Ask your ISP's DNS administrator to set up an alias (or CNAME) of
something.domain.com that points to domain.com. 

A default installation of Xitami does not care what name is used to request
pages-- if a request comes to it, it serves its default page. 

If your real question is: how to make something.domain.com show a different
page than domain.com..... use the vHost wizard in Xitami's Admin screens.

The percent sign indicates the next 2 characters are for the hexidecimal
value of the character in the URL. For instance if you find a %20 it means
there is a space in the URL or one of the files you are pointing to....
Remove the space from the filename and it will fix it. However in your case
%2E is a period .... Your browser should have no problems interpreting this.
I don't believe this is a problem with xitami...
Just a shot in the dark, but check to see if pdf is a valid mime type in
xitami.. if not try adding it. see if this resolves the problem.

Doug,
   I assume your "non-local" IP address is a registered pubic IP address?
Have you run a TRACERT to see where the connection fails?  Is your cable
company blocking port 80 (some do because they don't want you putting
servers on their network).

I haven't done any tracing, but it is a dynamic IP address, and I think it's
registered.  However, I just chatted with the ISP's tech support, and they
said it would violate my user agreement if I was to run a web server on my
PC.

That sucks.

Who can use programs like Xitami, if not average joes like me who pay for
residential accounts?  If I was going to pay more for a commercial account
I'd probably use something more substantial than Xitami, wouldn't I?

I'm a newbie in this area, as you can see.

Thanks,

Doug

Doug,
    Cable companies are notorious for locking you into their way of
thinking.  ISP who offer DSL on the other hand generally understand the user
mind set.  Part of my business is offering access via DSL and we have a
large number of companies running web, email, ftp, IRC servers .... just to
name a few.
    I would strongly argue your reasoning about Xitami however.  With modern
software, just because there is no license fee doesn't make the product
inferior.  In fact, I have contracts in excess of $45,000 p/month for
ecommerce web hosting....ALL of which run on 3 servers using Xitami.  I had
MS IIS for awhile, but keeping up with security patches and doing the
necessary housekeeping to keep the damn things running 24x7 became a
full-time job.  To be honest, one of my Web servers (running on Win2k
professional) hasn't been touched for 6 weeks now.  That's a big deal to me.
I know I could run it on *nix and probably not touch them for multiple
months on end, but I also write custom software that only runs on the Win32
system.

Matter of taste. IIS has some MS-specific frills, and Apache has
some features good for very high traffic. But a majority of
servers running IIS or Apache could just as well run Xitami. It
is mighty "substantial", mainly by being lean and clean and doing
what it does very well. 

> one of my Web servers (running on Win2k professional) hasn't been touched for 6 weeks now.  That's a big deal to me.

My Xitami 2.49 on WinNT4 has been up since 20 Sept 2001, and was
down then only for a major hardware replacement. If not for some
small bug in FTP upload, that locks it once or twice a year when
one of my helpers tries to upload a mess of files, it would
probably run forever. Especially on Win2000, which has a better
TCP stack than NT4.

Just curious, if you run TaskManger (ctrl-alt-del) Process, what is the memory
usage reading after 4 months of uptime?
My server humms along dutifully, but I terminate and restart it every few days
because of the memory leak. (and to dump the excess buildup of the tmp .cgi
files that don't get deleted)
For example, when I start Xitami fresh, it runs at about 5,010k. After 12
hours or so the memory usage is at 7,032k. Keeps going well past 15k until I
restart it.. who know how bloated it will get.. I'm afraid it might explode;-)
I am running Xitami 2.5b4 under W2K 5.00.2195 SP2 with 512k ram.

[ xitami stability good, only trouble with FTP ]
PR> one of my helpers tries to upload a mess of files, it would
PR> probably run forever. Especially on Win2000, which has a better
PR> TCP stack than NT4. 

I've got another problem with Xitami, or at least: I think Xitami may
be causing some troubles. But maybe it's due to TCP stack troubles on
Win98, I don't know.

Let me explain my setup and when the problem occurs:

The server I'm running xitami on has two network-cards. Basicly the
setup is as follows:

Internet  --CableModem  ---- Server(NIC1)
                        ---- Server(NIC2) ----- LAN

So, the server has two NICs, one for the 'outside' and the other for
the Lan. The server runs Win98 and serves my homepage with Xitami.

People on the LAN can do anything they want on the internet because
the server is also running Sygate software.

Now  the  problem is that everytime someone on the LAN connects to the
homepage (either on the local or external ip-address), the
internet-connection is lost! After about 30 seconds, the
internet-connection to the outside is back again. Pretty strange
right?

Could this be due to:
a) The workings of Xitami?
b) The OS; Win98?
c) Sygate?
d) Something funny the ISP has done to the CableModem?

For the record: with 'External' I mean that via the LAN people connect
to the homepage on the NIC1 IP-address instead of NIC2.
(So, NIC2 having the local 192.168.0.1 address).

Any suggestions?

I guess you are running the Windows-version of Xitami then? The
console version (which seems to run in a 'dos-box') does not have that
problem, to my knowledge.

For one thing..if you're behind a router/firewall/NAT..you can't access =
your
network via public IP...it just won't work..don't try it.

As far as running a web server on residential accounts...cable companies
tend to not allow this because of a few reasons, which I'll try to =
explain
below to the best of my knowledge.

I know @home had very strict policies about servers period. They worked =
on
the idea that not everyone in each neighborhood who subscribed to cable =
was
going to use it (some places had neighborhoods, we had the entire =
county) at
the same time. So, they could wire a t1 to 200 people assuming that only =
20
or so would be on at once. The uplink was capped to prevent too much was
being used.

So if you had 3 or 4 users running servers getting a lot of traffic..it
slowed EVERYONE down.

With DSL it's a bit different..you pay for your bandwidth, and that's =
yours.
Granted the telephone company may have a t3 going to the main =
servers...they
get more if they need it. Some providers kick you off DSL.

I'm a Verizon subscriber. I have a standard 768/128 ADSL Residential
account. I currently run Xitami, M-Daemon Pro, and Serve-U Pro on my =
other
PC upstairs. Now..I have two IP addresses thanks to my hub and DHCP, so =
I am
able to visit my site via public IP and vhosts. I guess I'm just a lucky
one.

Wow!  That's great!  I don't believe I've ever seen an NT box run longer
than 10 weeks without needing a reboot.  I've never had an issue with Xitami
causing system problems (although I do tend to think the NT Service version
isn't nearly as stable as the Console version).  I do have a regular
schedule however for rebooting all my NT servers...if I miss even one of
those times I'm just asking for trouble.  I also have 3 Netware boxes that
I'm pretty sure have been running non-stop for nearly a year.  18 months ago
I finally took down a 486 Netware v3.12 server that had run non-stop for 3
1/2 years, doing daily file and print sharing.  'Twill be interesting to see
what happens with Netware 6.

My gut reaction here is that Sygate is the "problem." I have a lot of
experience with Sygate AND Xitami on a Win98 box. Whenever I use Sygate as a
NAT (connection sharer), any servers (software daemons, and not just Xitami)
run in that machine act strangely ONLY when you try to access them from a
LOCAL machine.

What I THINK is happeneing here is that Sygate is tring to redirect the
incoming request out to the Internet, but only after some time passes does
it figure out that the request is actually intended for ITSELF, and then let
it through. In so figuring out what to do, Sygate sort of goes beserk for a
little bit, and fails as a NAT until it regains its composure.

There are plenty of solutions. Personally, for the home office, I have been
using a Linksys DSL-Router for NAT duties. It is much more stable than
sygate, more flexible for port forwarding, and it never requires rebooting
;-). With Sygate off of your Win98 server, it can be free to run Xitami
quite happily. Just tell the Router to forward port 80 (and port 21, if
using FTP also) to the Xitami machine.

I have a Win98 machine running Xitami, a separate FTP server, a mail server
(pop and SMTP), a remote access server (sort of like PC Anywhere), plus it
serves out a laser printer to the LAN and provides a shared Windows hard
drive. I restart it every 80 days just out of habit. Though it is not being
slammed by hundreds of users daily, serving speed is NOT an issue, nor is
stability. And this is a Pentium 133 with around 80 megs of ram I'm talking
about here.

My point here is to say that Win98 can be fine for your server if there
aren't dozens of concurrent users slamming it.

Win98 never has handled multiple NICs very well.

You'd be better off buying a broadband router/switch. That way you can use a
single NIC connected to the router/switch that will allow you access to
internet and your local LAN.

I just wrote to another post on this email list that I reboot my *Win98*
server every 80 days as a preventative measure only. It runs Xitami, WarFTP,
a remote access server (like PC Anywhere), a SMTP/POP server, Norton AV
weekly, PHP, plus it serves out a laser printer to the LAN and provides
shared Windows hard drive space.

True, it only services 5 people plus my LAN and elsewhere, about 300 emails
a day, and less than 50 unique web visitors daily, but it has been much
easier to manage and more secure than Mandrake 7 & 8, RedHat 6, NT4, or
2KPro. I'm sure it wouldn't scale that well, but for this, it works great.

I've run my win2k box for much longer periods of time and once everything is
configured properly, there should be NO reason it should go down. When I was
running my server at my college, it was up for about 7 or so months before we
had a power outage that lasted for over 3 hours (my apc only lasts 1 hour or
so).

The best thing about an NT or 2K box is that you can run everything as a service
so if the power does go out, you can always be assured when it ome back on that
everything can be restores back to the norm.

I'm really bad.  I run xitami (web server and ftp service) in the background
on a ME machine that is constantly being used as a multi-track digital audio
workstation.  Most people would call me an idiot, but until i get time to
dig enough parts out of the closet to make something like a pentium pro 200
MHz dedicated server, it works just fine for me.  It crashes every once in a
great while, but no more than it did when it was a dedicated DAW.  Running
Xitami in the background doesn't seem to impede performance at all.  And
some of the files i serve are over 10 meg.

 But, I do have to admit that I am running a AMD Athelon 1.4GHz 233 FSB with
256Meg DDR PC2100 RAM off a 7200 RPM ATA66 HD.  But most of those resources
get eaten up by the DAW side of things anyway (hence the crashes).  But even
as a daw/ web server, its far more stable than my p.o.s. dedicated office
computer (Dell Inspiron 3800 MPIII750 with 256 PC100 RAM - Dell, please come
home.) that crashes 2 or 3 times a day due to eaten up resources - even with
a memory manager (AnalogX's MaxMem).

Smoothwall is an excellent product. I'm running one at home on an old

Don't run any junk software, and lock it in a closet. 

That reboot 4 months ago was actually the tail of a planned major hardware
overhaul. Another box with NT4 Server (but no Xitami) had been up for 13
months when I killed it last week for fan replacement. 

I do have "interactive" (ie, a person sits at it) NT boxes that stay up for
months on end. I know, because the user forgets the password between
infrequent boots and I have to go kick-start after a power failure. But the
average is less. My home NT machine (which my wife surfs 10 hours a day) goes
from 2 weeks to 2 months between boots, and the usual reason for re-boot is a
DUN-fight (IE tries to control DUN but drops the ball). My desktop here at
work (it was NT4 for years) averaged about the same despite Netscape's
attempts to bring down the system.

Read:  http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index2.htm#TOC8

You need the Service version, you need to be Administrator. The self-installer
may fail; open a DOS box, switch to the Xitami directory, and run "xiwinnt -i"
to bind it to the Windows Service manager.

Compared with what?  2.5b4?  It's got a security fix for the Windows
device names denial-of-service issue (which helps, but it seems may not
be a 100% fix yet).

Use dns2go from www.dns2go.com .  Its free, and it optionally does automatic
port forwarding for anything with a www. prefix in front.  So, your site
would be http://www.mysite.com, and your ftp would be ftp://mysite.com .  I
have yet to figure out a way to get ftp://www.mysite.com to work, but I
think that is because it forwards anything with www. in it to the port you
specify, so the ftp request is not sent to the proper port.  I have to admit
that I haven't spent much time on it, so there my still be a way to do it.

Or if you have(use) a firewall (and you definetly should) 
you can forward your www.mysite.com (normally port 80)ip 
address to whatever address and port number on your 
internal network ie 192.168.1.1:1080

Subject: [Xitami] xitami - php (PHP_SELF)
Message-ID: <16VYG0-0TGbjsC@fmrl02.sul.t-online.com>

Hello,

I am running Xitami together with PHP 4.1 and mySQL on a Win2k
computer for locally testing websites ... everything seems to work
fine, except for a bit of a strange thing I encountered now .

When running the phpinfo() to get all the values for the system
variables etc ... the PHP_SELF variable is blank/empty .... it should
normally return the URL of the webpage from where you call the
phpinfo () function or the variable itself.

Anyone have an idea where the mistake might be? some Xitami server
setting somewhere? perhaps a setting in the php.ini configuration?
Any help is much appreciated. Thanks!
God bless you with His grace and peace 
Wolfgang

Known problem when running PHP as a CGI process, use _SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"].

Is this by itself sufficient or is also the _SERVER["SCRIPT_PATH"]
needed in addition? Will I need to change these back later on when
uploading to a Unix server somewhere at an ISP? or will this work
just fine ? 
Thanks.

	This is what I use:

// Under Apache $PHP_SELF is what we want, under Xitami it is $SCRIPT_NAME
// We find out based on which one has ".php" in it.
if (ereg ("\.php", $SCRIPT_NAME)) $CONSTANT_SELF = $SCRIPT_NAME;
else $CONSTANT_SELF = $PHP_SELF;
$CONSTANT_SELF = str_replace ("\\\\", "/", $CONSTANT_SELF);



	Then just use $CONSTANT_SELF

That would be equivelant of saying can you do it for me...

If you look in the documentaion for perl there is plenty of documentation
for using the net::SMTP module....
You can also find plenty of examples of using the module on the net...

Depending on what you are going to use it for there are some really simple
javascript routines for using the mail client on the client side. This may
be the route you want to go and is a down and dirty way of doing it...

If you are refering to links created by Xitami when you view directories 
on the server then the answer is to edit the file template/httpdir.gsl

replace the line
<A HREF="$(urlbase:)$(nameurl:)"><IMG SRC="$(icon)" 
BORDER=0>$(name:)</A></TD>
with the line
<A HREF="$(urlbase:)$(name:)"><IMG SRC="$(icon)" BORDER=0>$(name:)</A></TD>

You may also want to add the following lines near the start (before the 
lines that say
.-  We want the first character of the sort order
.directory.order = substr (order,0,,1) )
This fix allows your users to reverse sort the directory correctly

.- Bug fix - remove leading '=' from directory.order if present
.-  The attribute directory.order has a leading '=' if it is not the 
default
.-  order. For example:
.-  If the order in Xitami's defaults.cfg is 'nx' then when you execute the
.-  gsl for 'http://localhost/directory/' then directory.order is 'nx'
.-  but if you then click on the URL for Size and thus execute gsl for
.-  'http://localhost/directory/?order=snx' then directory.order is '=snx'
.if substr (order,0,,1) = "="
.  order = substr (order,1,,)
.endif
.- End bug fix - remove leading '=' from directory.order if present

I hope that if you do implement this, you will be ensuring that any
recipient to whom you send such mail is happy to receive it.  Most people
dislike intensely having HTML sent to them in mail (not least from the
security aspect).

Most definitely HTML never belongs in any mailing-list (or newsgroup)
postings.

Under windows, I want Xitami to run .cgi scripts as python script.  As it 
happens I have 
#!/usr/bin/python2

as the first line of the script, but that only makes sense on my linux machine.

How do I associate .cgi with python, for Xitami running under windows?

The same way.  Put the #! line in, and then make sure Python is on the
PATH.  Providing you have python2.exe somewhere on your PATH, it'll
"just work" with Xitami.  (Yes, this is a special feature of Xitami.)

Take a look at the code for aMail - a web mail client. It is written in perl and
can receive & forward html emails. It doesn't compose in html, however if you
send yourself a html email & inspect what amail receives you should be on the
right track.

I had the same recently Dave, I'm new to this server..
Don't rely on browser ftp, use a third party ftp software and make sure
you're set to "passive" mode.
You should get in as Guest with no pass or Aonymouse.  Hunt down the ftp
link under configuration and you can see permissions or create new
permissions.  From there, hit the help button for more info.

Try SmartFTP, it free and fairly full featured.

p.s Dave

In your linksys, you should be able to drop the DMZ if your not gaming or
webcam and just go to the IP forwarding menu in lynksis admin and set the
ports 80 and 21 open to the machine IP address your hosting with.  This way
your IP address will be less available for exploit on the remaining ports.

Thanks Mike, but I am using WS FTP and as you could see it is using passive
mode, it doesn't matter what access or permissions are set up....same thing.

Suggestions thta the problem is Sygate and/or Win98 seem likely to be 
correct.

I reformatted the HD of my gateway machine and installed smoothwall 
(www.smoothwall.org) and then was a vrey naughty boy and installed 
Xitami on the internal LAN port precisesly what Smoothwall doesn't want 
you to do. It works a treat!

Is it necessary to run an IIS web server to run Exchange 2000?. I'm
thinking that's what the problem is because it ran fine before I
installed xitami as my webserver.

> Under windows, I want Xitami to run .cgi scripts as python script.  I have #!/usr/bin/python2 as the first line of the script, but that only makes sense on my linux machine. How do I associate .cgi with python, for Xitami running under windows?

In Xitami Filters, associate ".cgi" with "C:/snakes/python/python.exe"

Any time Xitami is asked to deliver a file with ".cgi" extension, it will feed
that file through that program, capture the output, and send it to the
browser. 

I don't handle snakes but I do this for a VisualBasic program that processes
database tags in files. In my Xitami Filters, ".htmwl" is associated with
"D:/cgi/fetch.exe", the name of my VB program. 

Alternatively: hack the open-source code for Xitami, find the special-case
where Xitami/Win looks for "#!....perl" as the first line of a file and
searches PATH for a copy of perl.exe, and add similar lines to look for
"#!...python" and search PATH for python.exe. But recompiling Xitami on
Windows seems to want an MS C compiler, and IIRC the GUI version needs a
commercial package so isn't totally "free".

Dave,
I apologize, I had not read the whole post accurately.
Being as new as I am and running an "out of the box" config,  I need to bow
out now and let the big boys do what they do so well here.

I do recall seeing some things in the docs about wildcarding with the "/" as
well as aliasing but the resultant port connect showing in your last post
looks pretty odd.  Sorry I couldn't be of any help.

BTW I have had pretty good luck with the debug setting and log file exams,
for tracking down some of these issues, but I had to track down a log
analyzer first.  The error logs and access logs help after I cycled,
connected once, recycled, then examined.

Good luck Dave,
Mike

only.  How would I achieve this.  I want it so that if they click on members
it comes up with a username and password.  Can I also have a list of users
and their passwords?

Thanks in advance...

Hmmm.. Are you running a mail server on this machine?

Port 25 is the standard port for SMTP traffic, Xitami shouldn't be scanning
this low by default. In defaults.cfg add this:

[Ftp]
    data-port=1024

And see what happens.

Take a look at the Xitami.aut file.. I am pretty sure this is what you are
looking for ...
It is ducumented pretty well... You can generate your own definitions in the
defaults.aut file or use the
web based admin if it is available to you...

I attempted to recreate you problem...
Do you need to use passive mode for any reason ?
I do not believe Xitami support passive mode ... In WS-FTP options menu
uncheck use passive mode and this should clear up your problem

Is it necessary to run an IIS web server to run Exchange 2000?. I'm
thinking that's what the problem is because it ran fine before I
installed xitami as my webserver.

What special case would this be?

The code in sflproc*.* looks for a #! line that is something like:

#! /path/path/executablename flags

and if it can't find the literal /path/path/executablename, it then
takes just the executablename and tries to find that on the path.

It should work fine with Python.

You can rebuild the GUI version from source with MSVC.  I guess that
counts as needing a "commercial package", but it's a reasonably widely
available one.  (The source to the GUI was merged into the open source
version with 2.4b9/2.5b5.)

In theory it should be possible to compile it with other compilers, but
particularly the GUI version would take a bit of work to get the
resources compiled properly and linked in.

Thanks, Vance...WS_FTP does use passive mode by default...once I changed
that setting in the FTP client I connected thru with no problem. I have
always been able to use WS_FTP with the default settings to connect to FTP
servers in the past so I really wasn't looking at the clients settings being
at fault.

I find this interesting because the only way I'm able to connect is in
passive mode to xitami and I'm configured "out of the box".
As well as those I've had access my ftp from remote, they too had to go
passive.

I thought it was becuase I had blinded a handshake a handshake in port
routing in linksys.

Actually the documentaion does claim to support passive mode but I have
tried it on a few versions and none of them work using passive mode... As a
matter of fact I get an Invalid command response from it....

<clip>
ftp> PASV
Invalid command.
</clip>
Go figure...
What version Xitami are you running that accepts it ?

Doh!

PASV (and all those other "four-letter" commands, like USER) are the
commands used over the sockets connection between the FTP client and the
FTP server.  Few FTP clients will accept such commands at their user CLI.
These commands are what actually /constitute/ the protocol itself.

Some FTP clients will recognize a QUOTE command, which can push a
complete File Transfer Protocol (guess why I wrote that in full) command
over to the server for execution.

Anyway, the long and short of it is that to take advantage of an FTP
server, like Xitami, which supports "passive FTP" requires that you have
a client that utilizes passive FTP.  

I don't know, for instance, whether the command-line client included in
Windoze uses it: that code (as can be seen by extracting the Copyright
string from the executable) is based upon old BSD code of 1983 vintage.
Is that what you were using above, generating the "ftp> " prompt?

Doh is right...
I was not even thinking about that.... I just realized that was the fix and
went on with my business  (I have no use for it...)
Yes it would be a prompt from a Win2K box ....Well in short the defnition of
passive mode is quite simply telling the server that the client will attempt
to establish the file transfer port. It is a server and client command. The
reason passive mode is not working is your firewall is blocking the incoming
port from the client.....
I have to retract my statement earlier Xitami does support passive mode....

The special case of opening my mouth and putting my foot in it sideways.

Thanks for the correction.

Hi guys,

Another newby question:

I have set a directory as "private" with usernames and passwords in the .AUT
file.  It works well, When a file within that directory is requested, a
dialogue box pop up asking for userid and password.  If the userid and
password is correct, the page shows.  However, if wrong info was entered or
clicked enter with no info was entered, a page showing : "Error processing
failed - problem with schema" will show while the address still showing the
original requested URL!  Is there a way to either make changes to this
message or better still have it re-direct to a different URL?

Thanks
Pete

I take it you're using a 2.5 beta version (you don't say, but that
message shouldn't occur at all with anything earlier).  If so the issue
is that error messages are handled by a GSL template, precisely so you
can customise them.  But for some reason the template cannot be
processed.

Going out on a limb, I'd say you're probably trying to use Xitami 2.5b1
or Xitami 2.5b4 NT service (which is actually 2.5b1 in disguise).  Try
Xitami 2.5b5 (the latest beta) from http://www.xitami.com/
