You can add the necessary images to the folder
yourself, so use the same names as are required by the
.gif names.

Subject: [Xitami] php error
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20020501110256.00a9fce0@mail.intellispace.net>

Does anyone know what this error message means, when attempting to run a 
simple php page (all it has is a "print" command):

"This PHP CGI binary was compiled with force-cgi-redirect enabled. This 
means that a page will only be served up if the REDIRECT_STATUS CGI 
variable is set."

Thanks,

GB

if anyone has this problem, go into php.ini and:

Hi there,
Is this possible? I have adsl and 4 ipadresses The adresses all come in on
one NIC: eth0. (I am using Linux).
I have it already working but then I have to set the first to port 80 (do
nothing) and the second to port 1080, the third to 2080 and the last to
3080. That's not nice, I want them all on port 80 but all on seperate
adresses.

Is this possible?

Gr, Nico Berg

This can easily be solved by 1 instance of Xitami set up to have 
the default host plus 3 Virtual Hosts (VHosts) for your 4 IPs.

When creating a VHost, select the IP that you want to use for it.
I only have 1 IP, so I haven't personally used the IP method to 
specify VHosts, but I am using the DNS method successfully.

Before you begin using Virtual Hosts, please refer to the list archive 
from last month as there is a bug in 2.5b5 and the solution (requires 
re-compiling the source) was discussed.  If you're using 2.4d9, then 
VHosts should work for you.

Good luck

Set [server] ipaddress in each of the servers, rather than changing the
port number.  The default is "all addresses", which is why you can run
only one.  That said, you can do IP address virtual hosting or name
based virtual hosting in a single Xitami -- why do you want 4 of them?

I want 4 of them because I have host 4 different names. Now I have made 4
Vhosts but when I throw an index.html in his directory then it is not
allowed to read the file (set correct chmod).

??? There is alway's something..............

Practising what you [that] preach might have been a good idea :-(

Many years under Windows Xitami was a good friend of my. Now under Linux I
try to make 4 Virtual Hosts, I see nothing.

I have a NIC (10.0.0.150) on an adsl modem getting 4 ipaddress from my isp
(static) but they don't show up in the list of static ipaddress in Xitami
admin. So I have installed Xitami in a subdir directly under root. The basic
installation only listen to 10.0.0.150. I have (try) to make 4 Vhosts and
made 4 subdir's under the basdir for Xitami. In the cfg file for the Vhosts
I have put the option ipaddress=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx In admin I get no ipaddress
in admin (aldo I have them) but I can fill in host names, I did so. 

Nothing, "could not connect to remote server" ??? How come?

Greeting, and thank's in advance,
Nico Berg

P.s. If this is to solve with more information, please let me know as soon
as possible.

More information: I try to set the debug options to 1 but I dont get a
debug.log file...........

Is this part of my problem? I think so, Xitami doesn't react to the
ipaddresses at all. So there is no reason to write a debug file, nothing
goes wrong, he doesn't see this address to be one he has to
cover.............

	Use a tool. There are free and paid ones. An example of a paid one, which I
never used, is http://www.atelierweb.com/visiagra/index.htm

Heavy server usage testing via a tool I wrote primarily for testing the
speed of scripting languages under various conditions...instead it has
become a tool I use now for debugging this particular DoS/DDoS.  It really
doesn't matter if you don't know 50 people.  As long as a malicious person
is willing to use a distributed attack tool, all they have to do is find a
CGI on a Xitami server and within 2-3 seconds, the server will grind to a
halt and start returning zero bytes of data to most clients (it will appear
to them that the server is busy or down and then proceed to go elsewhere).

Hope this helps!

Well here are running 20 Sites on one Server.
No Problem on a Dual Pentium 400. 5% CPU, if there is some action.

An no, you can't use the  same port for two instances of Xitami.

Message-ID: <F4BC8DAA0288A64C9A141D877DB6266C021693@FILESERVER2.imatts.com>

Hello all
 
Here's my question
 
First My setup
 
Win2k server running xitami  and apache.
 
I have 3 ips
 
1.1.1.1
1.1.1.2
1.1.1.3
 
1.1.1.1    has to point to the apache server
1.1.1.2    has to point to the base host of xitami
1.1.1.3    has to point to a virtual host on xitami
 
the problem is that as far as I can tell xitami will either let you use
all the ips (which I cant because apache needs one) or 1 Ip (which I
cant use because I need to set up a Virtual Host. 
 
Does anyone know how to set Xitami up to handle only 2 IP's. I tried
editing the default.cfg like this
 
[server]
 
ipaddress = 1.1.1.2,1.1.1.3
 
but this gives me an error.
 
I also tries to set up a second instance of Xitami but only one will run
at the same time.
 
 
Help

Correct, that's all a single Xitami process can handle.  Instead, you
need to run two instances of Xitami, one for the first addresses, and
one for the second address.

I downloaded Atelier Web Visiagra. I use Xitami v2.5b5.  For the 
last 30 minutes I've been attempting to open 80 connections on a 
binary in the cgi-bin using a standard SSI exec call.   It appears that 
I've only been able to open around 20 simultaneously and 
everything runs fine.  Is there better software to do this?  Are SSI 
binaries handled differently than standard CGI calls?

Is this allowed?

I would rather have both vhosts point to the same set of cfg files
rather than maintain two separate but identical cfg files.
Is sharing a cfg file between two VHOSTS supported?
The documentataion wasn't very clear on this.

I had some problems with folks having difficulty establishing ftp connection, and I 
believe I traced the problems to multiple vhosts sharing the same cfg files. I've yet 
to see any other reports of this on this list.

I believe you can solve these issues with proper DNS configs.  I have three
domains sharing the same cfg file:

Xitami Defaults.cfg file:
www.domain.com=domain.cfg
www.domain.net=domain.cfg
www.domain1.com=domain.cfg

But from with in the Alias section for the domain.cfg file you can set
preferences pertaining that address each domain indepently.  But it gets
kind of tricky.

In the DNS I simply have three forward records and of course, only one
reverse record (which is the authority record).  The source/reverse record
is the address that will respond to the clients browser and then the clients
browser will begin talking to the new forward address that matches the
reverse address.

Forward:
www.domain.com    A    192.168.10.10
www.domain.net      A    192.168.10.10
www.domain1.com  A    192.168.10.10

Reverse:
192.168.10.10    SOA    www

It works, if that's what you're asking.  Xitami doesn't track which
files the configuration comes from in order to tell you off for being
lazy :-)

Hi all,

Now I have my 4 hosts asking myself a simple question (but not for me its
simple :-) )
How to make Xitami make use of PHP4 under Linux Suse 7.2?

I think it has somting to do with the correct Filter and Mime settings so I
have included my settings.

[Filter]
    Php = "\\usr\\bin\\php"

[Mime]
    Php = "application/x-httpd-php"

In Linux we normaly don't use double slash but single slash doesn't work
either. I have installed php with the setup of Linux the first time (didn't
do this later as a single package) included MySQL.

Who has some answers?

Greetings, Nico Berg

P.s. In the time I used Windows for this job the installation of PHP toke
care of Xitami why not in Linux......?

Those are backslashes.  You want to use (forward) slashes.  It'll work
much better that way :-)

Eg, 

[Filter]
  php="/usr/bin/php"

Depending on exactly how your PHP was compiled/configured you might need
to fiddling with it's configuration or rebuild it to make it work in
Xitami filter mode.

You don't need the MIME setting; it's completely irrelevant.

Presumably since you used SUSE's installation of PHP, not PHP's one?
Otherwise, try asking the PHP folks.

(As has already been pointed out, U**x filesystem paths do NOT use
backslashes; indeed, one can use single forward slashes [in most places]
in configuration files even under Windows, since the underlying file
manipulation layer of Windows does still understand its CP/M and/or Unix
heritage.)

In Linux (or ANYthing other than Windoze), we don't usually waste
bandwidth by sending this trash either...

Did you re-boot? Services stay active until you kill them.

Alternatively, you can kill a running Service in Control Panel,
Services (in NT4; it may have moved in Win2000). While there, you
can mark it "Manual Start" so it will never run until you demand it.
That should not be needed if UNinstalled and re-booted, but is a way
to block unwanted Services that won't go away.

I rebooted and xitami shows up nowhere in the task manager.  I don't know
where services
can be managed in Win2000 like they were in NT4 through the service icon in
control panel.
However (after rebooting) when I re-install the application xitami and try
to start it, it says the
port 80 is in use.  I can only assume that the service still has the port
somehow.  I did try using
a different baseport of 1000 and that works for me for now, but I would
like to clear up the port.

Mark,

  Look under Control Panel | Administration Tools or something like that.  Also many time you can stop services by Start | Run and then typing:

 net stop service_name (xitami in this case)

Other replies have told you how to find this under W2K; did it make any
difference?

Are you sure that it's Xitami that has the port?  Any possibility that
IIS has fired itself up on your machine?

rc5 should be the last version before the final release (as rc4,
rc3, ... :-))

its more stable and faster than rc3.

fixes:
------

the classloader now shows a correct errormessage when subclasses
cannot be loaded. 

the classloader doesn't crash if the classpath is invalid
(typically when using single slashes instead of \\ on DOS
filesystems like windows or os/2)

again bugfixing in sendRedirect()

additions:
----------

RunnerClassLoader#getResourceAsStream()

ServletContext#getResourceAsStream(), see implementation notes

logfile_remove_classname removes the classname from the logfile
when using GenericServlet#log(...)

the path of "srvl_config" is now automatically added to
logfile_path and classpath - we can use one servletrunner for
multiple sites now.

feedback is welcome.

what version of w2k are you using (me, pro, server, etc). some version have
iis services running by default. you have to shut them down. i turn them off
by starting a MMC with the computer management snap-in. all services are
listed there - and you can start / stop them and specify which ones should
start automatically. make sure all iis related ones are shutdown and set for
manual startup.

i doubt the old version of xitami is running. open a command prompt and
telnet to port 80 (telnet 127.0.0.1 80). if there is a listener running on
that port - it may give info as to what it is. if xitami is running - it
will tell you.

ex. - i get the following....
HTTP/1.0 501 Not implemented
Server: Xitami

I'd like to leave the web admin feature enabled but
only have it visible behind my firewall.  What would
seem to work best is if, rather than accessing the web
interface via http://www.myserver.com/admin, it could
be set to a port separate from the web server.  Then
as long as I left that port shut on the firewall, I
wouldn't run the risk of someone hitting it from the
outside, and I could use it at will from the inside.

Is this possible, or is there an alternate approach to
accomplishing this?

Thanks in advance.

Because I asked for the options to compile PHP with for Xitami, nobody
reacted. So, am I the only one using Xitami, Linux and PHP in one
combination? I can't believe it.

Is there someone who can tell me how to compile Xitami the right way so that
I can use it with Xitami?

I did some testing with this a couple of weeks ago.  If you're using Linux,
then run apache, since PHP was designed to be an apache module anyway. 
Xitami uses PHP as a cgi application, whereas apache runs it as a module and
parses PHP code much more efficiently.

Xitami needs no special options at compile time to use with PHP.  When you
compile PHP, it has to be compiled as a cgi app, not an apache module.  The
PHP docs are quite specific about how to compile PHP.

prevention: none known. i simply let xitami running in a loop.

:10
 xitami.exe
 goto 10

the servletrunner takes care of this situation and reconnects
after a while.

I'm fairly sure that this is a race condition in smtsock, which in some
situations isn't updating it's list of file handles to look for I/O on
quickly enough before trying to use it again.   We've seen similar
issues under Windows as well, and also in an internal rewritten version
of smtsock.  Race conditions are, by their very nature, hard to track
down and completely fix.

As Bernd suggests, running Xitami in a "restart if it crashes" loop is
generally a good idea if you depend on it staying up, as there are a few
oddities like this which can cause it to give up when it shouldn't.

tomorrow i will release a larger application to the public which

will try it.

(http://www.conacom.de/babbelfisch.html , not finished but
working)

good stresstest of our new server :-)

during the development of this application, i found some ugly
bugs.

my co-worker ender is trying to bring GNUJSP and the xitami
servletrunner together.

11.05.02 v0.9-rc6
 loadFromStream(..) gots file-formatted string instead of 
 the original classname, which causes troubles on some JVMs.

 FileSessionmanager: fixed a bug in an errormessage.
 ServletConfig_Impl returns NULL on unknown parameters now 
 (according to the specs).
 
 Container-Messages during startup are in the logContext of 
 the container now.
 
 If a separate logfile is used, the context-root is prepended 
 to the logfile_path now.

Hi,

I have installed the latest versions of Xitami and PHP and
everything seems to work fine first, but the problem ist, that
variables out of a form won't be send to the next script by get or
post method, what means if I try to load a script with
http://localhost/script.php?action=load the variable $action is
undefined. The php.ini seems to be o.k., what means register_globals
is tourned to on, so the problem must be Xitami. Does anyone know
this problem?

Thx for the help

Actualy I do have my Xitami in a loop.

:xitami-start
reloadc (a little program I wrote to count the reloads to the screen)
xitami
goto xitami-start

But say someone is loading the main page and it crashes half way through?  
Will they get a half loaded page or will it continue to load ok?

    Well I'm no expert but I like Xitami.  But I'll try and earn my keep here and answer a 
question.  :)  Be warned..  if you use Xitami FTP in high bandwidth you may get corrupted files.  
In they case a dedicated FTP program would be better.  Like for me so far the FTP seems to 
be working over my 768SDSL.  However if I ftp from one system to another over my local  
100Mbs switched network 98% of the time I get corrupted files.  I am still using the Xitami FTP 
because it is very convenient and easy to set up.

If you want to set yours up just add the needed info to your ftpusers.aut in your /xitami 
directory.  Now you don't even need to reload xitami when you update this file.  Xitami checks 
it after so many seconds (set in the xitami.cfg file).  Ok set up an account by adding these 
lines.

[chosen-name]       # <--This is the FTP login name you will use.
access=GPUDMR  # <--This is what permissions you want to give. (I have chosen all here)
root=e:\xitami\webpages\  # <--Set this to your folder you want to give access.
use-quotas=1        # <-- Do you want to limit space this account can use? 1=yes 0=no
soft-quota=50.0     # <-- If above=1 they get a warning when this is reached.
hard-quota=60.0    # <-- This account may not upload more than is in Mbytes.

Some of my personal experience with Xitami ftp.  When you set the "root=" directory.  Be very 
sure you set this directory to one that exists!  If misspelled or you get the address wrong your 
Xitami web server *WILL* crash every time the account is logged into. :)

Hope this helps some..  Gene Angel

Hi again,

unfortunately it still istn't working. Even if I don't want to, it
seems that I have to use apache, or is there still another thing,
that could be wrong?

Thx for the help anyway

Unfortunately it seems that runner.conacom.de has disappeared so I can't

Also I maybe stupid but I don't seem to have a JRE program with my 
version of JAVA (1.4). I do have  java program with similar options so I 
have used that and all seems fine with rc3 and my limited testing so far.

Why not use another extension instead of .php?

Like:

mysource.txt?

Good luck,

Thx Evan,

I know ;o)
but i'd like that Xitami displays a file from source when it has the
extension ".phps" and this SHOULD be no problem,
as i setup a "Filter" -> .phps -> php.exe -s
This forces php to display the file from source, but i think "Xitami" cannot
handle parameters?!

Regards,

ToPPi

- fixed bug in logfile (date/time format)

- experimental support for ServletContext#getResource(...)

- some methods of HttpServletRequest returning a platform

- instead of defining a config-file
(config=c:\\somewhere\\config.ini) we can add also
"config.variable=value" in servlet.ini (the servlet will see it
as "variable=value" after calling .init(..)

Hi Mark,

Guess it depends on version ... i have been using it for years now..... got
a copy of it when it was free during their development and had no problems
making it work.

Have used it on several sites without problems ... perhaps if you cant get
your version to work you should drop me a line and get a copy of the one i
have ?

Is it possible to run a DNS server on a Win9x machine connected to the
internet with DSL, but not have an internet IP address, but rather a
local IP address?

I'm looking for a free or inexpensive DNS server that I can use within
my company for my own needs. Is there anything like this out there? Can
it run on the same machine that my Xitami is on or does it need to be a
different machine?

Xitami is set up to look for this anyway or do I have to do it through

Yes, for basic testing just create a cgi-bin directory and put your
script files in there.  It should have been in the default archive, but
the packaging tool decided it was empty and could be omitted :-(

You could use  SimpleDNS from http://www.jhsoft.com/ 
    Free 
trial only. I've used GPL SmoothWall which is a firewall 
with bulit in web proxy (Squid) and a caching namesever. 
You'd have to edit the shared hosts file. Go to 
http://www.smoothwall.org  GPL -> Free SmoothWall needs an 
old PC for use. Simple DNS runs on WIndows.

Someone else will can answer with more experience in running DNS over 
NAT.  But I have run a lot of servers over NAT (FTP, WEB, Email, Finger, 
etc).  Basicly if the correct "incomming" Ports (this is normaly a config option 
on the Gateway/Server) on the external IP are directed to your local (NATed) 
IP then you can run most any server you like.  Hope that helps.

GUI tells me port 80 in use...the Service just starts, then stops...but yet,

Perhaps a bit off topic.... but hopefully someone here has run into this

My ISP has decided to require the SMTP server to log in with username and

So far I have been unable to find any mailing script that does this...
I run a small server on thru my ISP access line, not at the ISP itself..

what OS are you running?

assuming you're running windows... it's probably something related to IIS.

start a dos prompt and enter the command       netstat -a       to see what
ports are open. might at least get you started....

I saw a posting a while back about a free web log analysis tool.
I did a VERY good job of saving the email.
So good, I can't find it anywhere.

Anyone ... ideas on web log analysis tools.

Thanks in advance,
Gunnar

ok, fixed my own problem, and this may show up again so if anyone archives
this, they'll have it.

apparently I typed my server IP in...that wrote it into defaults.cfg...all I
had to do was make that a wildcard, and it fixed the problem

Most ISP ask for some authentication of their users, so their server is not 
used as a 'open relay' so that bulk mailers can use it to send their junk.
The most used (imho) is 'pop before smtp' that mean you have to check your 
mail account just before sending your mail: the ISP's server remember your 
ip address and will allow you to send your mail through their server. THis 
is the simpliest solution for non-business users since there is basically 
no settings to adjust.
Another method is smtp authentification, you send your login name and 
password when connecting to the ISP's server. How you do that differs from 
server to server (your server, not the ISP's since the procedure is fixed).

Instead of sending your mail to the ISP, that acts as a relay, you can 
directly send mail to the recipients mailbox. Your server will have to do 
dns resolution of the mx record and connect directly to the recipients 
mailbox (this sounds more complicated than it realy is). This is the best 
solution if you have a permanent connection to the internet, but don't use 
it if you have a dial up since connecting to some mail servers can take a 
long time. It is the best solution because you have absolute control how 
you send your mail (some isp's won't allow sending out mailings, that is a 
single mail to too much recipients).

I'm using both Mercury and Merak and can inform you how to configure it.

I would be highly interested in the details of what you are using... My ISP
is rogers.com and they require smtp to authenticate using the username and
password.

I usually get that when a cgi times out before it has time to complete the
processing, try extending your cgi time out.

I have one script that times out because it cant process a log if the log
has hack attempts in it and no matter how long you set it for if this is
your problem you wont get it to complete.

I got this while developing CGI programs. It happens if a CGI does not terminate correctly, among other reasons ?

Yep that's what I did
phpinfo() will tell you were it thinks it is :)
it should say c:\winnt
basically php in running in default mode because it
can't find the php.ini file

Hi David,

Thanks for the info on POSADIS. I've downloaded it and installed it. I
have to admit that I'm having problems getting it to run, probably
because I don't know what the heck I'm doing. Do you have any examples
of the configuration files? I've read the documentation, but since I've
never worked with DNS servers before it's like reading greek. I put in
the default values in the configuration files, but when I try to run the
program it gives me error messages such as unknown command, but the
commands I've used are in the documentation.

If you or anyone out there can help with sample config files I would
really appreciate.

Kelly

Hi All,

I've been working like this for some time,  and just thought to ask if
anyone knows away around my minor problem.

My server is also my work station, on a home network behind a netgear
firewall/router.  From any point behind the firewall I need to type in or
refer to the local ip address to test scripts or access html pages.  NAT is
setup to direct port 80 calls to the webserver...

Is there anyway I can set things up so I can write my perl scripts refering
to the actual domain of my site and have them work behind the firewall?  Or,
more simply, for me to type www.archaetext.com into a browser v. the local
IP address?

Thanks,

Michael

I am using DNS virtual hosts for students in my senior projects class.
What I want is for each team to have its own password for its own =
directory.
Pre-VHosts, that was no problem, I just put the directory name and =
password into defaults.aut

Now, I have a virtual hosts setup where:

ProjectsTeam08.ewu.edu points to the \Webpages\Team08 directory, etc

This works fine, once I solved some Win 95 network configuration =
problems.

Unfortunately, there appears to be no longer any password protection.
My current setup looks like this:

1. Each team has its own .cfg file that points to its own .aut file:
[Server]
    Cgi-bin =3D "C:/Xitami/webpages/team08/cgi-bin"
    Hostname =3D "projects.ewu.edu"
    Webpages =3D "C:/Xitami/webpages/team08"
[Security]
    Admin =3D "0"
    Filename =3D "team08.aut"

2. The team's .aut file holds the passwords
#   Created by Virtual Host wizard
[/Admin]
    admin=3D-
[/setup]
    team08=3D"Rj4Qx56M"

3. In defaults.cfg I reference the config files
[Virtual-hosts]
    ProjectsTeam08.ewu.edu =3D "team08.cfg"
and the standard .aut file
[Security]
    Filename =3D "defaults.aut"
which still holds the passwords from the pre VHosts days
[/team08]
    team08=3D"Rj4Qx56M"

Presumably I am not referencing something properly somewhere.  I thought =
it might be the [/setup] line in the team .aut file, but I have played =
around with that ( /team08, etc) with no luck.  I have gone through the =
help files and my archive of Xitami mailing list messages, with no luck. =
I am going to keep the system offline until I can fix it, but the end of =
the term is coming up.  Any idea where else I can look?

Steve Shervais

You can add it to your hosts file (ie in C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc or similar)

yes.

remember your domain name (archaetext.com) points to your public (internet)
ip address. you can't access that from your private network behind your
firewall. so you need to setup a local dns entry for archaetext.com to point
to your private ip of the workstation.

do like below - unless you run your on dns server, in which case just make a
dns entry for it.

example - my domain is smiley.tzo.com - on the public internet it points to
my public ip of 204.210.245.111 - but inside my home network i run a dns
server and it's entry for smiley.tzo.com points to 192.168.13.200

If your PHP.ini file is not located in c:\winnt
php will not find the php.ini file and therefore use
default compiled values and the
cgi.force_redirect=1 is default
and no matter how much you change
the php.ini file if php can't see it it won't
update

If you have internet access on the test computer (probably since it's your 
server?), you can alse access your local pages using their internet name. 
My router is configured to allow that.
If the test computer don't have internet access, install a small proxi on a 
computer that has internet access and access your pages via the proxi server.

Just upgraded to 2.5 beta and found two problems:

2. Alias to path with blanks no longer works (when included in quotes).

Running on Win2k as a service.

Are these known problems and are there any workarounds.

Does anyone know how to get BadBlue working for PHP with Dreamweaver.
It'd be usefull also to know the different way one will need to set up, say,
dreamweaver4 in comparison to Ultradev.

I've followed the test scripts held within Badblue,  and yes I get "hello
from BadBlue and PHP" etc.  But can I get Mysql and PHP talking with
Dreamweaver4 and IE?   NOPE!


PS. If the BadBlue guys read this, why not throw in PHPadmin with the next
release?  You've already jumped on one GPL project (gnutella).

hmmmm.... thanks.

I've done this and rebooted a couple of times... all it does is send me to
my router's config menu.  Granted, this is a file called "Hosts" in the
Windows directory and the file type is "Sample"... there are no other
"hosts" files about though, nor an "windows\system32\drivers\etc directory".

Am I being dense, or is there something else I should try (or both?)

Thanks

i configured the router so as to allow access to internet for some computers.
when you have access to internet, external dns resolution is also performed 
and your server will be accessed correctly from the lan.
if only one computer has internet access, install a proxi on it.

Subject: [Xitami] When crashing
Message-ID: <3CE61D3A.3895.42E82DC@localhost>

When Xitami crashes on a Win2000 box, there is an alert box that pops 
up saying that, and I paraphrase, there has been an error, and the error 
is being written to the log.  Could someone tell me where this log file 
would be located within the Windows file structure.

I am starting to suspect that the crashing is actually being caused by an 
improperly installed (and expired) secure key, but I will not know and 
don't plan on making matters worse until I can review this purported 
error log.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Subject: [Xitami] pipe####.cgo/cgi files
Message-ID: <CGEKJMNPHLPPMHMJGJPBKEGICEAA.jdwarren@myhumbleabode.com>

Can anyone tell me how I can go about turning off creation of pipe####.cgo
and pipe####.cgi files?  (#### is an instance counter, e.g., 0001, 0002,
..., 1000)

I have Xitami 2.5b5 running on WinXP.

These files are being created in the Xitami main program directory, not in
my specified temp, cgi-bin, or http-root directories.

They are being created every time a Perl CGI script that I am using for
navigation runs, which is leading to a large number of files being created.

I was hoping that this was the result of inadvertently turning on the debug
option for cgi, but alas, that option was already turned off.

If this is a bug in the code that someone has already discovered, please let
me know which module it is in so I can go fix it and recompile.

Thanks much!!!

As I understand it (from previous discussions) is that the *.cgi & *.cgo files
are a fact of life with that version. You can't turn the output off. I have
however discovered that in the cfg file that you can specify which directory
that they are put in - which is what I do. I host a site that runs an
intensive .pl script that outputs hundreds (sometimes thousands)of the cgi &
cgo files a day. I also discovered that they will get overwritten at a certain
point in a FILO fashion leaving a constant 1000 files or so in that directory.
I do have to restart Xitami once a week to get the memory release and I then
clear out the cgi and cgo files so that they can start at zero again.

JRE = Java Runtime Environment (as far as i know).
JVM = Java Virtual Machine

for the enduser, both are the same.

Typically you can think of the Runtime Environment (JRE) as the context in
which the Virtual Machine is placed. 

Eg., Am I running in a browser or directly on top of an OS?  In other words
the JVM is a specific component of the JRE, it is also the most important
component, the part that executes the Java Bytecode.

For example the "JRE" for applets is typically the browser, while any os
level application is run in a JRE for that platform (Windows, Linux,
Solaris).

Message-ID: <000101c201e3$70b9bd60$7034fea9@zoo>

I'm new to Xitami and need some help/advice. I'm just using Xitami on my
home computer for personal site production use; I'm not trying to use it
as a web server for the world to have access to my sites. What I want to
be able to do is to get to my web sites using simple urls.

For example, I want to be able to have a seperate, simple URL for each
of my sites on my home computer. If I type "http://qbono" I want it to
load the site located at "e:\websites\qbono.com\", and if I type
"http://xpxl" I want it to load the site located at
"e:\websites\xpxl.net\", etc.

How do I make this happen?

Specs: WinXP, Xitami v2.4d9

Thanks!

Brian

Find your "hosts" file, hidden deep under the WINDOWS folder. Mine
is at C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc Open it with NotePad.

Add lines :

127.0.0.1       qbono.com
127.0.0.1       xpxl.net

Now (if Xitami is running with basic configuration) these URLs
should open your default page. (Only on that machine.)

To make them open different sites:

Use the http://localhost/admin tool to set up Virtual Hosts for each
site.

The fist box is a nickname and will be used as file-name for the
VHost CFG files. "qbono" is a good name here.

In "DNS Host Name", put "qbono.com"

In "Web page directory", put "e:/websites/qbono.com/" (note:
forward-slash is probably best here, even on DOS\Win boxes.)

Ignore the other boxes for today.

"Create", Save your way back to the main admin screen, and then it
may be best to re-start Xitami.

Test.

If it works, repeat for your other sites.

When the real qbono.com comes on-line, you better go into the
"hosts" file again and delete the pointer to 127.0.0.1 !!! Otherwise
your PC will forever go to your box, not the real server.

This is _very_ off topic for the Xitami mailing list (it has nothing to
do with Xitami, and nothing to do with webservers).  Please take it off

I was recently having a problem with missing hard disk space. So, I asked a
friend (who uses my server) to see if he could find the problem as I was too
busy...he said fine...here's his AIM message response (named edited) I was
wondering if anyone could give me more info:


Ax: c:\xitami\memtrace.lst was 25.7GB in size
Ax: dont know what it was for but it was increasing by the minute
Ax: so i deleted it
Ax: so u wouldnt get any errors or crash
Ax: google says its Xitami's core dump file, whatever that is
Ax: look in settings and disable core dumping maybe?
Me: ok, thanks a lot man
Ax: no problem, hope everything goes well now
Ax: it was fairly easy to find
Ax: i just went to properties on every sub directory directlt under the c:
until i saw one that was huge in size....xitami was, so i checked xitami's
root directory first and there it was, 25.7 fucking gigabytes. I'm wondering
if someone had a few terrabytes of a hard drive if it would fill that up
too, jeez...i guess it dumped all activity to one file.

Hi Even,

I have followed your recommendation and everything works as expected for as
long as the size of BIG_RESPONSE stays under (2^16).  However, when that
threshold is exceeded something breaks.  In my use case, LRWP sometimes
generates 65,838 bytes of data.  When this happens, Xitami sends only few
packets of that response back to the client.  Is it possible that 65,838
byte value somewhere overflows a 16-bit buffer?  Could you point me to the
right direction?
Regards,

Dmitry

Pre-VHosts, that was no problem, I just put the directory name and password
into defaults.aut

Now, I have a virtual hosts setup where:

ProjectsTeam08.ewu.edu points to the \Webpages\Team08 directory, etc

This works fine, once the Xitamites solved some Win 95 network configuration
problems (thanks guys)

Unfortunately, there appears to be no longer any password protection.
My current setup looks like this:

1. Each team has its own .cfg file that points to its own .aut file:
[Server]
    Cgi-bin = "C:/Xitami/webpages/team08/cgi-bin"
    Hostname = "projects.ewu.edu"
    Webpages = "C:/Xitami/webpages/team08"
[Security]
    Admin = "0"
    Filename = "team08.aut"

2. The team's .aut file holds the passwords
#   Created by Virtual Host wizard
[/Admin]
    admin=-
[/setup]
    team08="Rj4Qx56M"

3. In defaults.cfg I reference the config files
[Virtual-hosts]
    ProjectsTeam08.ewu.edu = "team08.cfg"
and the standard .aut file
[Security]
    Filename = "defaults.aut"
which still holds the passwords from the pre VHosts days
[/team08]
    team08="Rj4Qx56M"

Presumably I am not referencing something properly somewhere or havn't set a
flag right.  I thought it might be the [/setup] line in the team .aut file,
but I have played around with that ( /team08, etc) with no luck.  I have
gone through the help files and my archive of Xitami mailing list messages,
with no luck. I rolled the system back to the old setup, but I'd really like
individual logs to be available.  Any idea where else I can look?

Just a shot in the dark here..

Have you tried removing the slashes? Maybe something like:

[setup]
    team08="Rj4Qx56M"

It probably won't make a difference, but in my vhost aut configurations I use
relative paths. (I also don't use the web admin either.) All 26 of my domains
work perfectly and all have password protected directories.

There's a school of thought regarding running a name service daemon that
if one isn't totally confident of what everything does, one shouldn't
even be contemplating doing it :-)

Can you beg, borrow, steal (or buy) a copy of "DNS and BIND", by Cricket
Liu & Paul Albitz?  It's published by O'Reilly, and is well worth the
money.  DON'T buy the version for WindowsNT (unless you're contemplating
running the NT named); the "ordinary" version provides a much better
insight into just why any (or all:-) of the RRs exist.

[Somewhat belated response since I'm about a week behind on reading the
mailing list.  Sorry if someone's already given you the same advice.]

Have you thought about running a caching DNS server inside the firewall,
and letting all the machines on your LAN use this for their queries?  It
could then be authoritative for your local internal "domain"; and
requests to resolve an address outside that domain would be passed by the
named to your ISP's (or other) name server, through use of a "forwarders"
line in the configuration file.

That's how I run here: my (this) OS/2 machine is also the NAT router for
the LAN, and runs BIND.  The latter is authoritative for dsl.co.uk, and
answers local queries; anything else is passed on to my ISP's name
servers.  I can get away with this arrangement because so far as the
outside world is concerned, there are only MX records for dsl.co.uk,
which route incoming mail to my ISP's relays which delivers them to me
(by SMTP).  (There's also an entry for www.dsl.co.uk, which is hosted by
my ISP, since I'm only on an ISDN dial-up.)

Incidentally, if adopting this approach, be sure to read what Albitz &
Liu have to say about running such a system: it's probably also covered,
at least in part, by Bellovin & Chadwick in their book on firewalls,
since it's an approach often used on large "intranets" behind a firewall.
In particular, it's a very good idea to have at least two duplicate
forwarders lines, both pointing to the same name servers at one's ISP.
This tends to facilitate getting a response from an external server
before local machines' resolvers decide that it's an "unknown domain".

Please don't dual-post in both ASCII and HTML.  The latter provides no
more information than the plain ASCII, but occupies (on average) 200% of

The file provided is, as you've discovered, a *sample* hosts file.  To
make it into a real one, you need to edit it as appropriate for your
situation, and also RENAME it so that its name is *actually* just "hosts"
--- without anything after the "dot".  (I thought that at least one of the
comments in the file actually said that you need to do this: perhaps M$
is making things even more obscure in newer releases?)

Perhaps your system is hiding known extensions, or something; try doing a
DIR in an MS-DOS command prompt, rather than farting about with the GUI.

Subject: [Xitami] module behaviour
Message-ID: <004a01c2036a$043f4ff0$2272e2d1@reimer>

hi all,

I'm quite new to Xitami so forgive me if this is an ignorant question, but I
was wondering if there was a way to hook up Perl scripts (or PHP scripts) to
a LRWP in a manner similar to Apache modules. The pleasant thing for us mere
mortals (scripting-level coders) with those modules is that we can run perl
and php scripts unmodified (from how they would run as a filter or cgi
process) but still realise a performance increase. I like what I see about
Xitami (especially in the areas of configuration and file serving
performance) so I would be very interested to know how to leverage it
efficiently for scripting purposes.

I also have a question on Perl Server Pages. Does anyone have a Windows port
yet? The idea seems like a very good one to me as Perl is so solid and is
especially impressive on larger tasks.

Trent

These loggings are caused by infected ISS servers which are now trying to
infect your server and many others. These attemps are of no harm for you
because we dont use the vulnerable Microsoft server software ;-) And believe
me, I have exactly the save loggings and I sleep well! The infected servers
try every IP-address with a certain scope and jumps with increments of one
from IP address to IP address and then look for an active server on that IP
address. So they dont use your domain name! but only your IP address to
reach you. So your server is there!

We process our server logs once per day with a logfile analyzer, then rotate
them via cron job.  Our servers are set up to do all logging on seperate
disk partitions or disks to prevent a locked server from an overflowed root
partition.  During the height of the NIMDA crisis last winter we were forced
to go to three times per day log file rotation to recover log partition
space from the log entries of zombied IIS webservers.  The problem is not as
pronounced now, and we have gone back to normal once per day rotation, but
there's still some zombied M$ servers out there.  I had one sys admin tell
me that they solved the problem by creating a fake directory and file
structure that matched what the NIMDA worm was looking for, which cut the
number of log file entries drastically.  I never tried this, but it did make
sense.

If you want to get rid of lines like the above, you
can, by using my logfilter program (windows only).

See
http://hace.dyndns.org/files/files.html

And download LOGFILTER.ZIP

If you have any questions about that program you can
email me.

Cheers,
Melle

More than likely you are on a cable modem and in your service contract you
are not allowed to run a web server on your machine.  Most cable providers
set up a fairly solid firewall so that those on the outside can't get into
the network.

They can "see" you because they are on the same subnet as you.

You can't get in because of an external firewall that your service provider
has set up.  If you can find someone in the area with the same service
provider, try using their machine to see if you can reach your machine.
Remember, cable networks are all on the same LAN with the same level of
bandwidth.

Hope this helps!

I'm on a cable modem. I bought their business plan and 
1/4 T1 both ways and dedicated IP's.

I believe you are right about the 'home' cable modems, but there 
are business solutions. 

The business plan cable modem works as well as SDSL.

If you need the outside world to see your server parked down by
your knees, you'll likely need a business plan.

I'm playing $100 per month for 1/4 T1 and 3 ip's

Sorry about that...when this list gets requests like this, it usually is
someone on a home cable modem trying to get it to work through the firewall.

Well, considering that other people are able to get to your machine and
(I'm assuming here) Xitami is set up and works fine on localhost, then
there is probably an issue either with DNS or your ISP.  Make sure that DNS
entries are pointed properly at your server, wait 24-48 hours for any
updates to take effect, then try again.  If that still does not work,
contact your cable provider about the issue.  Remember, 'nslookup' is your
friend :)

Hope this helps!

I have had some trouble securing my Xitami FTP via the firewall. So when I FTP from my desktop to the server, I disable the firewall turing the transfer, and turn it back on.

I would like to expose my FTP.

The 'command' is on port 21, but the data seems to be on any number of ports which I don't always want open.

Is there a way to get Xitami to operate on a finite number of ports (both in and out) so that I may set my firewall to allow these ports for Xitami FTP?

Have a nice Memorial Day.

Passive mode is enabled.  Try turning it off by using the command PASV when
connecting.  However, I don't know how Xitami will work.  Generally you
have to play around with various FTP combinations to get it to work properly.

Xitami FTP is ok for low usage.  However under high bandwidth conditions (my 100 mbps 
network) I was getting corruption to files.  Low bandwidth corruption only happened rarely 
though some of my users clients for some reason couldn't connect to it.  So for me I went with 
a stand alone ftp client and use Xitami for my web services.

Gunnar-

Having the has the same problem-my solution was to use 
OpenSSH on the server and use puTTy on my desktop (or 
WinSCP) as this setup only uses a single port (22) which 
can be opened and closed as needed. I'm no security expert 
but AFAIK FTP is very insecure anyway. Solved two problems 
doing it this way.

just a thought-

FTP is secure enough, and is one of the oldest protocols on the internet. 
It is also one of the most efficient protocols to use for transfers of large
amounts of data.  There are other options, such as rsync over SSH, but this
would require a public key to be placed on the host server, and requires
root access, or at the minimum an anonymous rsync server.  FTP happens to
still be the most reliable and efficient client/host solution for data
transfer.  Any security issues with FTP is based on the server setup itself,
not with the protocol.  I consider giving a client FTP access to a server
much safer than giving a client SSH access.  Somebody with SSH access can
execute shell commands, while FTP clients are more limited in their
capabilities since they are designed to only transfer data.  If packet
snooping is a problem, use encrytped or EFTP, which is every bit as secure
as SSL.

Part of the "problem" with the FTP protocol and firewalls is that FTP
servers listen on port 21 while data connections are initiated by the server
from its port 20, to a port on the client identified in a PORT command. 
This port will be a random port number that is probably closed by the
firewall.  Using the PASV command is usually the way around this, but be
aware that there are FTP servers out there, that in violation of STD 3,
RFC1123 [2], do not properly honor the PASV command.  I do not know if
Xitami's FTP server is one of these.

As always, for any server administrator, whether you run a single "hobby"
server on your cable modem, or manage a WAN, a review of the appropriate
RFC's would be in order to make sure that you understand what you are doing,
and are doing it properly.  In this case, you would want to refer to RFC1579
and RFC959.

Well I'm still on my quest for a good counter for my Xitami for OS/2.  I came across a really 
nice set of counters with c sources here: http://www.boingdragon.com/downloads.html  So I 
decided to see if they would compile under gcc for OS/2 and run the counters under Xitami.  
Well I compiled the counters and the all compiled smoothly with no errors at all.  However 
Xitami seems to ignore them.  Could someone with some OS/2 experience give me any 
headway to understanding what is going on or if this can work?  Thanks!

If you're concerned about FTP security here's something I've been 
using for a while and seems to work fine.

http://safetp.cs.berkeley.edu/

It is a secure wrapper for ftp servers and ftp clients that adds a 
secure layer to existing applications.

Setting the FTP server and the wrapper it's a bit tricky, you'll have 
to change xitami ftp port settings among other things but the 
documentation is clear.
The client install is a snap.

Everything will of course run slower because of the encryption but 
that's the price we have to pay. There are different levels of security 
though, at least the passwords are not sent in clear anymore.

Good luck

Stefan

Stefan,

I took a look at this product. Close. The data is encrypted before being sent.
(Clients that I have written are sending the data back to the server)
So I don't need the transmission itself encrypted. The data already is.

What I was looking for is to limit the number of ports that Xitami talks on
when FTP so that I can assign these ports to Xitami.exe in the firewall.

Someone said to use passive mode on the client. Does this limit the
number of ports Xitami uses ( or the client uses) so that I can secure 
these ports in the firewall ?

Thanks for the responses.

Hi, on more info. I'm most likely behind a firewall, so could this be the
problem with PASV? And could it be that when using PORT the port isn't routed
through the firewall? Robert

How do you call them in your HTML? Where did you put them so Xitami
would find them and know that they are to be executed? "Xitami seems
to ignore them" is really not much clue.

But back up. Do they run from the command line? Assume you have
compiled "amy.c" to "C:\Xitami\cgi-bin\amy.exe". Open a DOS command
window and type "C:\Xitami\cgi-bin\amy.exe". You should get a whole
lot of gibberish. If you look fast (or capture it in a file), the
first few bytes spell "GIF89a". (Actually, I think it says
"Content-type: image/gif" and two line-feeds before that.)

Does it do that?

It might not, because the code tests the environment variable
"PATH_INFO" (probably doing things different depending on if it
thinks a webserver called it). So try it this way:

C:
CD \Xitami\cgi-bin
set PATH_INFO=foo
amy > amy.txt
copy amy.txt amy.gif

(I assume that OS/2 command line syntax is DOS-Windows-ish. Check
it, especially the exact syntax for SET.)

Open amy.txt in a text reader, it should start "Content....GIF89a"
and be a lot of gibberish after that. Open amy.gif in an image
viewer, it should be a picture.

If it works from command line if PATH_INFO is not blank, the problem
may be that Xitami does not always supply PATH_INFO. in amy.c,
change PATH_INFO to SCRIPT_NAME (twice) and re-compile.

No.  You keep asking questions about "assigning" ports and PASV "mode". 
PASV is an FTP command - not a mode.

If you'd refer to RFC1579, it would become more clear.  You first need some
knowlege about how FTP works.  Different firewalls are different also as far
as the firewalling rulesets and how they deny or reject packets - you should
refer to your firewall documentation.

It's impossible to try and figure out what ports the FTP server will need to
do it's data transfer and then attempt to open those ports in the firewall
because the firewall would look like a sieve.  That's why the PASV command
is normally by an FTP client to get thru a firewall (causes data to be
transfered on the connection port), however, you must make sure your FTP
server properly implements the PASV command first - some do not.  It also
makes a difference whether or not your FTP server is on a DMZ or a private
network, and whether on not it's IP address is private or public.  With more
advanced firewalls, like Dachstein LEAF, you can do FTP transfers to a
privately addressed server behind the firewall, WITHOUT having to use the
PASV command.  That's one of the reasons I install Dachstein LEAF (Linux
Embedded Appliance Firewall) routers for all my clients.  If you're using
one of the cheap cable/DSL routers that are available commercially for
firewalling a home/small business network, you're pretty much on your own,
as these routers have only very limited port forwarding capability,
extremely limited DMZ support, and the firewalling ruleset is very, very
basic.  This is not a cut and dried issue, as there are many variables with
different FTP server/client/firewall combinations.

Thanks. It's getting clearer. 
It's my clients that I have written (Shockwave) that will FTP to only this server. FTP will not be available to the public.
Since the client can assign the port, and my client software communicates to this server, I can open the port on the firewall.

And I think you have helped.

The client can make suggestions to the server as to what mode to use.  It
all depends on the server implementation.  Try going to a DOS Prompt and
running straight FTP commands to Xitami.  Particularly, play with the PASV
command which toggles passive mode (if the server supports it).  For
transfers through a firewall you probably want it off.

Hi, thanks for the tip. I'm using the Linux version and I don't have "debug CGI

I was wondering if there is a way for Xitami to prevent the caching of
content which comes from filters. I never thought about it before but with
my other test servers (IIS, Apache) when you hit reload on your browser on a
filtered document (like PHP) it never pulls a cached copy. With Xitami I'm
only getting a true recheck if the PHP file itself has changed. This is a
concern as an unchanged PHP file could normally be used to bring up
information which changes regularly in a database for example.

Any ideas?

Are you sure that it is not browser caching?  Make sure the logs are
returning something other than HTTP/1.1 200 (or HTTP/1.0 200).

Hope this helps!

Now in your last sentence, what is it: Has the PHP
file changed or not? If it has not changed, Xitami is
doing a good job of providing a cached copy. If the
PHP file HAS changed, than Xitami is of course doing a
good job of processing the PHP file again (pulling, as
you say) and serving the new file up.

Be clear: What's your concern?

Greetings,
Hace

hi Hace,

thanks for getting back to me and sorry if I was unclear. The problem I was
having is that indeed I only got a new processed version when the file
itself changed. The reason this was not helping me is that the file was
pulling information from a database and the database was changing. Just
because the PHP file itself did not change didn't mean that it shouldn't be
re-processed. Whenever I changed the file itself (I just added a space
character at the end of a line) sure enough the PHP file was re-processed
and I got the latest info from the database.

Looking at some of the other helpful comments I may take a look at the PHP
settings.

My thanks to you Thomas and Regis for looking into this.

Trent

Just a couple of thought but how about these meta tag:
/<META HTTP-EQUIV="expires" CONTENT="Wed, 26 Feb 1997 08:21:57 GMT">/  - 
Have the PHP write the current date and time into the tag.
/<META HTTP-EQUIV="Pragma" CONTENT="no-cache">/ - Also forces the 
browser to not cache the content of the page

I know there are PHP Header() function equivilats to these meta tags as 
well.

Not all browsers pay close attention to META tags.  Using the header()
function to dump HTTP headers back to the browser is generally more
effective - especially through HTTP proxies that rely heavily on cache data
being correct.

Hope this helps!

I've had the same thing happen on occasion.  The problem is that the
browser cache is pulled up instead of the PHP page.  It really is annoying
since the databases I use show that the entries were entered properly.  So,
my solution is to put a "refresh" link that will update the page, which
works but is not attractive for those who have to use it.

Hope this helps!

Thanks Thomas and all who've answered. I hope I'm not wasting your time here
but I really like this product (Xitami). I guess I was wondering why I was
getting this problem with Xitami and not with Apache or IIS? Do they somehow
generate headers for filtered content telling the browser not to cache it?
Also, (and this may expose my ignorance) how would the browser know that a
PHP file has been modified? I guess I'm surprised that if I modify the file
it will always be re-processed the first time after and my browser will see
the modification.

In-Reply-To: <1022524431@coconutcomm.com>
Message-ID: <1022527644@coconutcomm.com>

As I understand it (from previous discussions) is that the *.cgi & *.cgo files
are a fact of life with that version. You can't turn the output off. I have
however discovered that in the cfg file that you can specify which directory
that they are put in - which is what I do. I host a site that runs an
intensive .pl script that outputs hundreds (sometimes thousands)of the cgi &
cgo files a day. I also discovered that they will get overwritten at a certain
point in a FILO fashion leaving a constant 1000 files or so in that directory.
Xitami appears to keep about 24hrs worth of the files that are overwritten in
the FILO fashion.
I do have to restart Xitami once a week to get the memory release and I then
clear out the cgi and cgo files so that they can start at zero again.

I use a Linksys cable router. Would this idea of ftp using various ports
(if I read this message correctly) be a likely reason that I can (from
the outside) connect to Xitami's ftp (running on an odd port, 384) but
when my client requests a "list" I get no response? I do have the port
384 mapped. The system works fine and I get ftp lists when Xitami is
running on it's normal ports (80, 21). I have to use an odd port due to
cable blocking 80. Currently I am using a free generic ftp server to get
around this. I like Xitami's though because it is so easy to setup
usernames and passwords.

Thanks in advance.

Different firewalls are different also as far as the firewalling
rulesets and how they deny or reject packets - you should refer to your
firewall documentation.
It's impossible to try and figure out what ports the FTP server will
need to do it's data transfer and then attempt to open those ports....
If you're using one of the cheap cable/DSL routers

If you're using port 384, then also open port 383 and use passive
transfers.  This works with most RFC compliant FTP servers.  The Linksys
cable/DSL router, while a fine device for home networks, is a poor choice
for running port-forwarded servers on private IP addresses behind the
firewall.  The reason is because it's firewalling ruleset is too simple and
restrictive, and not dynamic enough to provide good security and still be
able to run a server.  I believe Linksys' solution was to offer limited
support for DMZ - you should refer to the documentation for your router on
how to set up the DMZ network, and put any servers on the DMZ, then place
workstations or other PC's on the firewalled network.

One other thing I don't like about the Linksys router is that whoever wrote
it's firewall ruleset used alot of DENY rules instead of REJECT, it's
default is to DENY ICMP packets, and it uses flashram, which is writeable
and/or configurable for a cracker.  They stand out like a sore thumb on a
half open syn or stealth portscan, and opening ports to servers behind the
firewall is basically the same as not running any firewall at all, as a good
cracker can tunnel a Linksys router in under 15 minutes if there's any ports
open.

i've enabled the #exec function of SSI and it kicks out my little cgi program

a duplicate page, using <!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/nowplaying.cgi"-->

outputting the actual executable, rather than the expected results.


so there's part one.  part two:

Trent,

Sorry it seems I did not understand what you were
saying. I thought you meant that a changed PHP file
was in fact changed output, now I understand.

What you probably want to do, is add the following to
the top of your PHP file:

// past date
header("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT");
// always changed
header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") .
" GMT");  
// HTTP/1.1
header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache,
must-revalidate");  
header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0",
false);
// HTTP/1.0
header("Pragma: no-cache");                          

Good luck,




=====

Give Xitami a try. It's feature rich, secure and fast.

Subject: [Xitami] Problems getting CGI to run
Message-ID: <3CD9780C.E36E8316@p3.net>

After installing the server I was initially able to run a test script
locally, but now when I attempt to run the script, both Netscape and IE
pop a box asking me if I wish to open the file or save the file to
disk.  I've tried reinstalling the server, but to no avail.

HTML pages are being served correctly.
