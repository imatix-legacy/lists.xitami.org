Subject: [Xitami] Xitami DOS reported, fixed
Message-ID: <080220041937.10666.410E9812000D2ED4000029AA2160280741CC090201040906@att.net>

Hello Pieter,

Sorry to bother you on this subject.

At this time I have not updated to the corrected Xitami version for the reported Denial of Service. I am using Xitami V2.5b4 and using the test code reported with the use of nc.exe and the DOS does not occur using Xitami V2.5b4.  (??)

At the time Xitami V2.5b4 was down loaded I did not down load the source code for 
V2.5b4, so I cannot look at the routine http_parse_header (*,*) to see if the problem exists. 

I am curious if this version of Xitami is ok in the routine http_parse_header (*,*) or is it some Xitami DEFAULT management setting I set to make it work????


The only change to the Xitami DEFAULT management settings was to add a few web page descriptions in Virtual Hosts and to require passwords for all users of FTP. All entries for web pages in Virtual Hosts as well as DEFAULTS are set as:

        Password file: BLANK   - blank to disable password protection  
        Case-sensitive passwords?     YES
        Allow directory lists?         NO
        Allow web-based admin?        YES
        IP address mask:*             - eg. 111.222.333.*  
        Superuser password:           - gives FULL ACCESS to ALL RESOURCES  


Here is what happens when the TEST.BAT is used with the string DOS (with no :):

    If the IP address of the Xitami server is used 
    to execute TEST.BAT errors are reported, and if 
    a web page is used the text of that page is 
    returned, as expected. And, the Xitami V2.5b4 
    server continues to run as expected by providing web 
    pages to a client browser and the cpu utilization 
    at the Xitami Server remains at or <1% during 
    idle times. I am using a test server so it can 
    be controlled with respect to other browser accesses. 

The following are the outputs from the Xitami Server when TEST.BAT is executed with the ip address of the Xitami Server:

   C:\JLong\NetCat>test 10.10.10.2 80
   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

My apologies.  It appears that I selected the wrong option when telling
the mailing list software to throw away this message and it ended
up going through to the mailing list.  (At least half a dozen spam
messages every day are making it past our spam filters and sit awaiting
administrative attention like this.)

The HTTP side of my site is running just fine, but I am having trouble 
getting my system configured for FTP. The goal is a plain vanilla anonymous FTP of a 
pot of files stored in a single directory. 

As just one example, I can put on the files in an FTPROOT directory in the 
XITAMI folder, but I cannot seem to set the configuration file to look in that 
directory. I keep getting error messages that say the file cannot be found.

I am sure the answer is quite simple, but would appreciate some insight into 
what I'm doing wrong.

The version I am running is 2.5c2 - downloaded a week or so ago. All the HTTP 
directories are in WEBPAGES in the master XITAMI directory and work just 
fine. I don't really care where I put the files for FTP downloading - I have tried 
an FTPROOT directory in the XITAMI folder and also the same directory in the 
WEBPAGES folder.

In any case, I made the defaults.cfg copy and despite tinkering with the ftp 
directory in the file, I typically get some version of a "file not found" 
notice when I try anonymous FTP access. Occasionally I will get a directory 
listing where the text files suggest that I have ended up in the PULBLIC directory, 
but that is rare. 

By the way, both HTTP and FTP on the same bunch of files has been working for 
seven years on an old machine running Microsoft PWS so I know the basic 
internal lnks are sound. The HTTP side of the site is now much superior to the old 
one now that I am using Xitami, so it is just a bit frustrating trying to get 
the FTP elements working. A sample can be found on:

http://taggart.glg.msu.edu/gyro/gbee.htm

If you scrioll down the page, you will find a link to the GYROBEE LOGO - the 
link points to:

ftp://taggart.glg.msu.edu/gblogo.gif

and would, with the old system, result in the retrieval of the GIF file. All 
the FTP links are intended to be that simple - just a way to retrieve 
miscellaneous files that are stored on the system and intended for use by visitors to 
the site.

Thanks for your reply.....Ralph

Hi Ralph,

My system runs with the same version and I'm only just half a year familiar with websites and all 
that "Stuff". Please excuse me, if I explain this a bit like a newcomer.

It sounds for me that you copied the xitami.cfg to the default.cfg. That is not the way it should 
be. You create a default.cfg and put in the settings you prefer for YOUR system. Only that, nothing 
else. Xitami will read first the xitami.cfg and after that the default.cfg and the settings in the 
default.cfg will override the ones in the xitami.cfg.

I have some directories in the ftproot from xitami and I have no problems to get my files.
The directories are looking like this:

..\ftproot\directoryname-1
..\ftproot\directoryname-2

one user can access only one of the two directories with the rights I gave them.
You are looking for a user "anonymus" create one and as far as I understood, this user should only 
be able to retrieve files. He will get the right "G" for get.

Your ftpdirs.aut should look now like this

[directoryname-1]
    anonymus = "G"
[directoryname-2]
    anonymus = "G"

make sure that you have one space between = and "G"

and your ftpusers.aut should look like 

[anonymus]
    Access = "G"
    Aliases = "0"
    Hard-quota = ""
    Password = "anonymus"
    Pipe = ""
    Root = "directoryname-1"
    Soft-quota = ""
    Use-quotas = "0"

Same thing here with the space. If you like, you can disable the password. If I'm correct, it will 
look like password = "".
I don't have anonymus access. 

I hope this will be correct and it is from help for you.

Hi Ralp,

Put this in your ftpusers.aut file:

[Anonymous]
     access=G
     password=""
     root=/xitami/ftproot

And you should be all set to access ../xitami/ftproot and the files  
therein.

You have to change 

ftp://taggart.glg.msu.edu/gblogo.gif
to 

ftp://taggart.glg.msu.edu/

then you 
need to go to the main screen of Xitami
click on configuration
click on ftp  ---> top right corner
click on top Define button
click on new
fill in information
make sure you click on save all the way out.

Thanks to all - especially Johannes - who replied with solutions from the simple to complex. The FTP service is now running fine and the solution was simple:

The defaults.cfg file contained just the FTP service data wit this root:

root=/xitami/ftproot

The anonymous section of the ftpusers.aut was modified as follows:

access=G
password= ""
root= /xitami/ftproot

For whatever reason, the space after the = in the ftpusers.aut (password and root) file appear to be critical.

One little point: the "username" for FTP should be spelt properly, as
"anonymous".  Also, surely there should be no password specified for the
anonymous FTP client, because the convention is that each user provides
his/her e-mail address as password.

It's better than that; it's in EVERY message on the list (including the
one with your query, and in this reply from me).

You're using Mozilla; if you go to the menubar and click on
View->Show->Headers->All, you will see that one of the headers reads:

    List-Archive: <http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/>

Remembering that the list is hosted by xitami.org and not .com, then
there might be something in that.

Hello Martin,

what does "tring" mean ? But I assume a problem.  Sorry english is not my native language. 

You shouldn't change anything in xitami.cfg and xitami.aut
Create a file called default.aut and if you have to make changes to xitami make them in xitami.cfg

Regards your admin entry: As I mentioned above, create a file called default.cfg
Put the folloing in there

[/admin]
   Your Username = "Your Password"

That is all. Make sure you have a space between = and " 
Leave the xitami.aut as is. That should do the job and you should be able to open up the GUI from 
your browser.

OK great, just name the folder "files" or whatever you like, make sure you have
the subdir as PUB in ftproot viz. 'xitami/ftproot/pub'. Drag n Drop your public
file you want accessed into /PUB/

You can go back to your site and paste an ftp link so you dont have to phyically
type it in your search box each time you would like to test or go to your site;
send me the home page link or your domain URL and I will try it to see if I can
logon FTP Anonymous. Xitami runs its FTP server out of the box.


Hope this helps out.

Subject: [Xitami] protected directories not accessible with SSL
Message-ID: <412FD305.10906@coaxial.ca>

I have recently upgraded from xitami to xitami pro to provide SSL to a 
customer.

Xitami/Pro v2.4c3 on windoze 2003 enterprise

I have configured sslhttp.cfs and migrated my config files  (only 
defaults.aut and defaults.cfg - this is a single user / single domain 
server)

http://domain                                works
http://domain/private    user:pass   works
https://domain                              works
https://domain/private  user:pass    Doesn't work

when trying to access a protected directory (defined in defaults.aut)  
or even /admin  when using HTTPS, it rejects the credentials, though 
they are correct and work with non-ssl.

I'm sure there is just some setting I missed, let me know if there is 
any further info I can provide.

Thanks !!
Josh

With the last versions of xitami I noticed that on slow connections
(dial-up) it often happens that the connection breaks and there is a socket
error; even downloading Xitami i had to use getright because of the
disconections.

I tried to solve this recompiling with Borland C++ builder (it was
difficoult... some things was quite tricky to make it work... lots of
warnings and some errors... but I did it somehow).

I think it's some timeout error on writing on the socket: if I understood
how it works, when a file is uploaded is divided in segments and uploaded,
and there is a timeout for every segment to be sent. The size of the segment
is in the file "smttran.c", the "var" name is "BUFFERSIZE" and is initially
set to 32768L, (32k), the timeout is specified in "smtsock.c" and is named
"WRITE_TIMEOUT" and is set to 10 (seconds); this means that if you can get
more than 32k in 10 sec (>3.2kbyte/sec) everything should be ok, otherwise
the socket "thinks" he isn't able to send data. I tried lowering BUFFERSIZE
to 4096 (4k) and WRITE_TIMEOUT to 60 sec (it makes about 70 bytes/sec should
be enough!) and it seems to work.

I hope at Imatix try this so, if it works, everyone can use it.

Has anyone else experienced this problem ? 

Does anyone have any ideas as to the cause or solution ?

This list is pretty dead.
