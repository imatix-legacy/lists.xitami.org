Hey fellow Xitami users,

This is just a quick suggestion: Why not join the Xitami IRC channel on 
irc.freenode.net? There has to be quite a few Xitamites out there, and 
if we all joined the channel perhaps it could be the beginning of a 
better Xitami community?

irc.freenode.net
#xitami

If you need an IRC client, I suggest you try out HydraIRC. It's free and 
very feature packed, while staying relatively easy to  use.

Hope to see some of you there. I'm usually online from 0800 to 2400 GMT 
+1, with breaks here and there for lunch, dinner and whatnot..  :o)

Sincerely,
Thomas

There was a thread some time ago about creating something "new".
Unless it's sponsored by Imatix itself, it is quite pointless, since they are 
too much initiatives, diluting the Xitami community even more.
My proposition was a forum, like http://freedns.afraid.org/forums/index.php 
were two (or more) forums are available, one for general questions/responses, 
one for important information (with restricted access to disallow newbees 
posting).

Hi Everyone,

thomas@kenshi.dk asked me about an IRC channel.  My reaction was "sure, why 
not?"  Now, this reaction has gotten me into deep water often but a Xitami 
IRC channel seems harmless enough.  Not like that time with the... but that's 
another story.

Now Mark Doigny points out that there have been alternatives to this mailing 
list proposed before, and they tend to fizzle out.

What's my position on this?  Well, first, I think any party succeeds only when 
the guests are fun.  What I mean is: iMatix can sponsor or encourage 
different kinds of forum but it comes down to what you, our guests and fellow 
party goers, want.

IRC can be fun, especially for quick answers to easy questions.  It's less 
intellectual than email lists.  Perhaps after all these years of being very 
serious with Xitami it's time to try to get onto bash.org.

OK, I'll join #xitami on irc.freenode.net and follow the discussion 
occasionally.  If the IRC channel seems useful, we'll announce it on 
xitami.com.

Well,

I do think the Xitami Email list should be changed to a better forum with
searches, posting, replies, threads, etc.  Xitami email list is extremely
outdated.  On another note, I do use IRC all the time - from home and from
work - because it is a great instant resource.  With IRC you don't need to
wait hours for answers.   Having been a user for quite some time, though, I
do recommend using another base server besides irc.freenode.net.  I was on
it last night and realized that the freenode.net server is very isolated
from the rest of the IRC servers.  On the other servers no one was on
#xitami - I had to switch over to freenode.net in order to find Mr. Thomas
who recommended we do this to begin with.

I use irc.qeast.net and irc.mindspring.com = they are very well connected
and tap you into the largest IRC communities.  There are plenty other
popular ones as well but those are the most convenient for me.  Someone
should create a bot for the #xitami channel too, that way there is always a
presence on the channel.

I also believe if the iMatix folks simply list it next to their support
information that Xitami users will automatically gravitate to it.  An iMatix
endorsement is what its going to take for any forum to work.  Its like
asking "who wants to play basketball?" versus "who wants to play basketball
with Michael Jordan?" - which do you think will get a bigger turnout?

First and foremost, the folks there need to fix their nickserv..

I registered there and it wouldn't let me identify. So much for IRC and 
Xitami.. (And no I am not clueless when it comes to IRC, I run my own 
IRCD here..)

I registered under a known name in my scripting so that I could use it, 
umm, password incorrect.. Umm, no, the password was correct. Busted 
nickserv..

recommended a bad nickserv.  The concept is still a good one, people just 
need to join the main IRC.  You can find me on irc.qeast.net or

Instead of telling people to join a server in particular, it might be
helpful to tell people which IRC Network to join. Net splits aside, if
you log into an efnet server you should be good to go.

Agreed. And I am a bit suprised that a web forum is being persued
instead of a usenet forum which would be accessable by both newsreader
and google, and archived by google as well. Personally, I would not use
a web forum.  I find web forum UI's are mostly idiotic and do not have
the patience to wait for the web, slow updates and viewing one message
at a time.  But if the IRC is going to be pushed, we might as well push
it by network rather than server, if the server is on a network.

I don't use Usenet or IRC, but hey I'm just one person and whatever the
majority believes is the best, probably is. Personally I do like webforums.
They are searchable and user friendly to even  the newbe's. But maybe the
folks at iMatix don't want that much exposure and only want Xitami available
to us geeks. There's a reason why web forums have 10's of thousands of
users. INReview has a membership of over 90,000.

this discussion is not the topic for which I signed up for.  if this type of
thread is what will be on this list, then it might be time for me to  look
at other options for a web server. add that to a program that crashes at
random times, and which I have not found a way to add CGI support and so on,
it looks like even the email isn't helping me.  there is another free web
server that does have built in CGI support, and that seems easier than
adding it to a server that crashes at random.

if the forum is changed to an IRC CHAT,  WEB FORUM, or usenet or other
format, I would not be able to participate since those services are not
permitted on my office network. there are others who may have this problem
as well. The archives can be made searchable, and the FAQ's can be updated
which would make an email list more productive.

So your office wants you to use Xitami but then won't let you get support
when you need it? I think it's time to change employers.

Anyway, I have been running Xitami on Win2k for a couple of years. All my
problems were caused by Windows, viruses, spywear or bad bots. Once I
encountered and fixed the problems Xitami chugges right along and doesn't
crash.

Doing a search on the Archives reveals a lot but if your job won't let you,
you may have to do it at home.

A couple of things.

Are you running Xitami with FTP enabled?
Are you running the Xitam GUI (the little Icon in the system tray)?

As a whole, I think Xitami doesn't crash without help from external souces.
But you need to give us more information, which is probably why nobody
answered you a week or so ago.

Ron

WoW!  I have been running Xitami since 1997, FREE I might add.  I have
always got support when I asked for it.  I have most always seen great posts
on this message forum.  Once or twice a year I see a twit.......   ;-)

If there is another platform you wish to go to David, then by all means go.
There is no need to flame it here.  You are a rare breed David, I guess you
can be proud of that!
When the time comes and you find that this other alternative you seek, just
does not add up.  We will all be here to help you and let by gones be by
gones.
As to the constant crashing you state???  I have run Xitami on multiple
platforms with a multitude of hardware configurations, NOT once, and I
repeat NOT ONCE has Xitami EVER crashed on me?  The only annoyance with
Xitami I have ever experienced is the fact that whenever I add a new Virtual
Host, I have to hard boot Xitami for it to take affect, whoopee???  I can
live with it.  I am sure there is a fix, or someone in this forum would
probably give me an answer for this fix, but hey, who cares, for all the
positive features that Xitami gives me, tis worth it.  I run PHP, CGI, PERL,
and others with NO PROBLEMS at all!

this discussion is not the topic for which I signed up for.  if this type of
thread is what will be on this list, then it might be time for me to  look
at other options for a web server. add that to a program that crashes at
random times, and which I have not found a way to add CGI support and so on,
it looks like even the email isn't helping me.  there is another free web
server that does have built in CGI support, and that seems easier than
adding it to a server that crashes at random.

if the forum is changed to an IRC CHAT,  WEB FORUM, or usenet or other
format, I would not be able to participate since those services are not
permitted on my office network. there are others who may have this problem
as well. The archives can be made searchable, and the FAQ's can be updated
which would make an email list more productive.

instead of web forums which allow for differing schedules (time zones) and

I can fully understand if there's a need to change IRC server for this 
project. I'm an IRC beginner myself, so I have no special reason for 
using one or the other. I will gladly join another server, if I'm told 
how and where. :o)

Let's have the info Russel, so we can get this project started for real.

Also I've read a lot of posts on this community subject. It seems as if 
there's as many opinions as there are a members on the list! On the 
whole I do think we can agree on one thing: An active and living 
community would be good for Xitami, and if it's good for Xitami, it's 
good for the people who use it.

So what to do? Should we just stay with the current solution, or should 
we try to create some sort of "hub" for Xitami info/discussion?

I would personally love to see a combined solution. Something along the 
lines of the mailing-list, a web forum and an IRC channel.

All this could be centered around a website where we tried to keep up 
with tips and tricks, problem solutions, case stories and general 
debate. I will gladly help out with hosting such a site.

Let's get this debate on the road. Xitami is IMHO a great program - it 
deserves a great platform for information/support/whatnot..

Regards
Thomas

 I don't use Usenet or IRC, but hey I'm just one person and whatever the
majority believes is the best, probably is. Personally I do like webforums.
They are searchable and user friendly to even  the newbe's. But maybe the
folks at iMatix don't want that much exposure and only want Xitami available
to us geeks. There's a reason why web forums have 10's of thousands of
users. INReview has a membership of over 90,000.

I am bit surprised that a real-time community (IRC) option is being persued
instead of web forums which allow for differing schedules (time zones) and
IRC-unfriendly firewalls.

PLEASE do not post in HTML to this mailing list; indeed, you should never
post in HTML to *any* mailing list (or Usenet newsgroup).  

Incidentally, you are mailing in *only* HTML, without the alternative
plain-text portion.  Whilst I don't advocate dual-mailing (i.e. in plain
ASCII *and* in HTML) either, since it needlessly increases a message's
size by, on average, three- or four-fold, you should note that many
anti-spam protection measures automatically deem "pure-HTML" as being
pure-SPAM.

As I mentioned previous - the only way another support forum (usenet, irc, 
web forum) will work is if its endorsed by iMatix.  Everyone has made great 
contributions to the discussion, but without Xitami Support group backing I 
don't think its going to matter a whole lot.  A web forum probably makes 
MOST sense (though others would disagree) and the iMatix folks can download 
free ones from various locations.  It doesn't have to or not to be hosted 
anywhere else besides the Xitami site.

But what ever the case, I think whats important is the iMatix folks finally 
take the initiative to improving the format of this Discussion Group.

IMHO  :-)

PS: to the twit who moaned about "not using xitami anymore" due to this 
current topic of discussion - I have been running Windows versions of Xitami 
for over 6 years now.  the only times it has crashed has been 1) a perl 
error which caused an infinite loop and hosed the xitami cgi and 2) I 
somehow corrupted the Xitami config file that prevented to from running at 
all.  So as you can see, it has been user errors that have caused Xitami to 
crash, not Xitami.

I concur with that. personally I find Gmail does a good job of
archiving stuff and I don't need anything else.

I've broken Xitami a couple of other ways - GSL for example - and I've
seen weird crashes when windows is nearly out of memory. But on the
whole Xitami has proven to be rock solid and reliable and I've used it
on a variety of machines since the 1990s. Is it perfect? no. but it is
good enough and that alos applies ot the support. Its good enough but
not perfect.

Wow, this turned into a real hot topic and it's probably time we moved on.
But one last promotion for a web forum. In a web forum you can have an area
for different topics and this could be one of them. Just about every piece
of descent software has a good forum and even some crappy software have a
forum. I think Xitami is great and will continue to use it. I have gotten
resolutions to everything I can think of here and have my own archive of all
most all of the messages for the last couple of years and sometimes refer
back to them when I need to. A forum just keeps things neat and tidy and
helps keep thoughts and areas where they should be.

I'm done,
Ron

So your office wants you to use Xitami but then won't let you get support
when you need it? I think it's time to change employers.

Anyway, I have been running Xitami on Win2k for a couple of years. All my
problems were caused by Windows, viruses, spywear or bad bots. Once I
encountered and fixed the problems Xitami chugges right along and doesn't
crash.

Doing a search on the Archives reveals a lot but if your job won't let you,
you may have to do it at home.

A couple of things.

Are you running Xitami with FTP enabled?
Are you running the Xitam GUI (the little Icon in the system tray)?

As a whole, I think Xitami doesn't crash without help from external souces.
But you need to give us more information, which is probably why nobody
answered you a week or so ago.

IRC,  I haven't the foggiest how to use that.  Well I forgot as haven't been 
IRC user in several years... never was fond of it at all,,, maybe if you 
like to read and chat real fast.

If you're taking votes, newsgroups or plain simple message board .. either I 
can appreciate and then eventually maybe I can unsubscribe or  do away with 
receiving the amply replied digest list.
Single mails don't work for me, digest does but it sure takes time to read 
and figure out who said what sometimes.

IRC CHAT,  WEB FORUM, or usenet are not allowed on my company network
either.

I agree that an upgrade of the Xitami website and the interface to the
already existing archieve material, keeping everything under one roof,
is much more feasible for users who are concerned with the Xitami
webserver itself.

General chat, exchanging experiences on website publishing or with third
party softwares is not something that needs Xitami webserver's name and
this is not the actual purpose of the Xitami mailing list.=20

I personally can tolerate these to a certain extent on the mailing list,
and occasionally do enjoy reading them; but I do oppose strongly third
party software advertisements.

Instead of telling people to join a server in particular, it might be
helpful to tell people which IRC Network to join. Net splits aside, if
you log into an efnet server you should be good to go.

Again, the needs of the one out weigh the needs of the many.

You need to have a few words with your company.  I can understand IRC being
blocked, but a web forums too???? That's rediculous.

IRC CHAT,  WEB FORUM, or usenet are not allowed on my company network
either.

I agree that an upgrade of the Xitami website and the interface to the
already existing archieve material, keeping everything under one roof,
is much more feasible for users who are concerned with the Xitami
webserver itself.

General chat, exchanging experiences on website publishing or with third
party softwares is not something that needs Xitami webserver's name and
this is not the actual purpose of the Xitami mailing list.

I personally can tolerate these to a certain extent on the mailing list,
and occasionally do enjoy reading them; but I do oppose strongly third

well i guess i'll throw in my $.02....

i like web forums. i'm very active in a few and they work well - if there is
a lot of traffic.

i see this xitami list as a small group of people. even when questions are
asked - a small group of the same people usually seem to answer things. i
can't see this being large enough or busy enough to move to a forum. people
just won't check it often enough because there will not be enough traffic.

for this size group - i think this email system works fine. i do wish it
were easier to have everything archived and searchable though.

Hello Bennett, Craig you emitted about RE: [Xitami] Community

Perhaps this xitami user should drop his .01 cts.
I'll bet there are a whole bunch of me lurking this list without really being 
active in here.
Usually because most of the questions i have are already answered or in the 
process of being answered.
So for me this list and the pipermail archive are more than enough to keep me 
posted and informed of xitami tids bits.
In most cases it beats a user manual.

Grts

I haven't used the ftp part of xitami & had it set to o off.. I now have 
a need to use it & need to set it to allow a friend to upload a 5mb file 
so others can download it.

I reset defaults.cfg to,
[Ftp]
    Enabled = "1"   & can ftp to my site & see this default  ftp page:

  Index of ftp://xx.xx.xxx.xx/

Up to higher level directory

What do I need to add so:
there is only one directory shown
a person with a password I give them can upload to this directory with 
an ftp client
anyone can download from this directory with a browser?

Hello Members,

here my opinion to this discussion

IRC chat > absolute not
webforum > ok, accepted
mailinglist > preferred

I had a look at the archives and the only thing which is missing for convenience sake is, to make 
it easier to search. 
I'm with this list now for a bit over a year, and i can't get rid  of the assumption that, as Ted 
pointed out, there are a lot people subscribed and lurking this list, but they are not "active" 
members. Why should the behavior change with a IRC or webforum ? Would those people more willing to 
help and give answers because we would have now a forum or IRC ?

I'm not familiar with php, perl, cgi, to be able to answer the questions as I would like to, but 
the ones I can, I try to. And with a mailinglist I can stay in the same way tuned as with a 
webforum. I can only read the mail (answer) as soon as it is sent, not earlier ! 
Those 30/ 60 seconds difference, hey come on, that's even nonsense to argue about.
And in regards to IRC; what's about timezones ???? Is everyone really sitting 24/7 in front of the 
computer to make sure to catch every message which arrives ? What is then about the not so active 
members i mentioned earlier ? What is the one sitting 24/7 waiting for ??

I'm in no way upset or disappointed, but those are only some objective views/thoughts I want to 
through into this discussion. The "newest and fanciest" stuff is not every time the best what it 
looks in the first place.

Johannes

I agree!  Everything else is an answer in search of a problem.  The 
mailing list is more than adequate for the purpose.

Hello Johannes Prost you emitted about RE: [Xitami] Community


Just one thing, or 2 actually.

Perhaps the silent lurkers like me can reply to this thread.

I just browsed my own xitami archive and it seems it goes back to 02-2002.
same month i started using xitami.

Grts
Ted.

This isn't specifically aimed at your post Johannes, but I feel I must 
correct a common misconception: Adding an IRC channel, webforum or 
whatever will NOT remove the mailinglist. It will still be here, it will 
still be used. The other tools are there to improve on the Xitami 
community, not degrade it.

The more methods we have available for communication, the better. A lot 
of people hate mailinglists, a lot of people can't stand forums and 
quite a lot believe IRC to be the work of the devil. It is impossible to 
satisfy everybody, so why not enable Xitami users to use whatever form 
they personally feel best?

Of course it would be best if the people behind Xitami just took care of 
all this and made the best information hub ever, but seeing as that 
probably wont happen, I believe it is up to us users to take the helm 
and move the community forward.

Here's my opinion:

IRC chat > Great!
Webforum > Great!
Mailinglist > Great!

Why this reluctance to try something new? If it fails, we can always 
fall back to the current system. It's not the end of the world.  :o)

Sincerely,
Thomas

the problem with having three seperate channels for people to use is when a
user has a question on say, the mailing list, and the people who have the
answer are not checking the mailing list because they are using the web
forum, then those people are not a community. they don't interact. when you
enable several different forms of communication, each reach a different
audience of people. if there were possible to integrate the web forum and
email list so that you post to the email and it were also posted to the web
forum and the reverse were also possible, then you would have a better
option.

an irc chat only involves those people who are online at that moment. unless
those chats were archived, it only helps the people in the conversation.
then you have issues with irc chats for people who can't use them due to a
print disability and need to use reading software to access their computer.
they cant use irc even if they wanted to because information moves so
quickly that it is impossible to keep up.

Thanks for taking the time to read this,

/David

IRC channels can easily be logged and viewed on a webpage. Mailinglists 
can easily be placed on a webpage also and a forum can easily be tweaked 
to correspond with the mailinglist. There could be a special forum where 
a weekly or daily digest of the list was posted for everyone to read.

Let people find the information they want where they want and how they 
want. That is the key to a healthy and active community. Restricting 
information to one format is not.

as David stated correct, say 3 different forms of communication wan't do good for the users who 
have questions and wan't do good for our great product, xitami. And as long as the messages from an 
IRC are not archived or listed for look up in some way, this communication way will be ONLY helpful 
for the ones who are  "live online". Plus the timezones problems.
A combination of webforum and mailinglist to one channel of support is in my view the best (easiest 
? ) way to achive. How to do that, I don't know right now.

Hello Alex,

you need to create 2 files. You can do so  through the GUI or just edit the file directly. The 
files are ftdirs.aut  and ftpusers.aut
In the file ftpdirs.aut you name the directories you want to be accessed by ftp or browser from the 
users you define . 
Here an example entry
    [../webpages/dirname]
        username = "*"

    [dirname]
        username = "P"
         anonymus = "G"
Between the " " you have to define the access right. Make sure you have a "space" between = and "
For anyone to download you can use anonymus = "G" as username and user right for this particular 
directory.

For the second file ftpusers.aut  it would look as follows. In this file you define the users right 
to connect, the root (dir), password...
Here the sample
    [username]
        Access = "P"
        Aliases = "0"
        Hard-quota = ""
        Password = "whatever-you-want"
        Pipe = ""
        Root = "dirname"
        Soft-quota = ""
        Use-quotas = "0"

For your example you would have to create 2 entries for the same root; one entry for the user
( username) and one entry for the visitors (anonymus) who should be able to ONLY download, as I 
understood correct.
For the user  Access = "P"
For the visitor Access = "G"
Both entries would have the same root = "dirname"

The directories which you want to create don't have to be in  \ftproot . I have, as example, set 
\webpages with its directories for the virtual domains to access by ftp only for myself. 
If I'm correct, xitami finds the way to the correct directory mainly through the username / 
directory entries in ftpdirs.aut

I hope this description is clear enough.If not, let me know and I will try to explain it better.

IRC is really just a community of common users who realize the benefit of 
instant help.  However, i am not of any software company offering support 
through IRC - its just their own communities that have informally created 
and participate in that medium.  WebForums are the best and most modern way 
of offering support.

Ok, those files exist. ftpdirs.aut currently reads;
[]
    Admin=*

I just want to use the pub directory &  if I understand what xitami & 
you said, if I want to allow uploads to the default ftp://myswbsite  pub 
directory, could I just change ftpdirs.aut to;

[pub]
       anonymous= "G"
[pub]
       username = "GP"

username being the name of the person I want to allow to upload ?  
Would I need to add another;

[pub]
       username = "GP"

if I were to allow other people to upload.

The ftpusers.aut file currently contains;

[Admin]
access=GPDMR
password=-
root=""
use-Quotas=0 # Enforce quotas per user

[Anonymous]
access=G
password=*
root=pub

[Ftp]
access=G
password=*
root=pub

[Guest]
access=G
password=""
root=pub

[Upload]
access=P
password=xxxxxxxx
root=pub
use-quotas=0
soft-quota=1.0 # Warnings above 4 Mbytes
hard-quota=2.0 # Blocks above 5 Mbytes

I have no need of upload or download quotas so would I keep that at 0 ?
Couldn't I just use this file with the changes I made here to password & 
root??

Thanks,
Alex,

IRC is really just a community of common users who realize the benefit of 
instant help.  However, i am not of any software company offering support 
through IRC - its just their own communities that have informally created 
and participate in that medium.  WebForums are the best and most modern way 
of offering support.

hi,
want to throw in my opinion too:
first and foremost i welcome any initiative to liven up the xitami 
community, since i think xitami is a great thing and the people joining the 
actual list make up a helpful and nice community.
but i turned away from irc,well, a number of years ago, since for technical 
discussions it has one major drawback - knowhow exchanged is volatile, 
anyone woh isn't there at the right moment doesn't get the useful 
information. this leads to two things:
- questions are asked over and over again, since you'cant lookup what has 
been talked about
- you are not automatically updated on issues you havent noticed that far 
(e.g. security stuff, features you didn' recognize until you get an info on it)

so, you had to be on the channel around the clock; given that it is very 
improbable that a critical mass of users will be reache, it would be way 
boring to han around there all alone.

I'd prefer a modern forum already mentioned by others. Such a thing could 
easily replace the mailing list if there were a need for replacement and 
enhance it probably. (I'd use an RSS-feed to grab the latest stuff and 
thereby have the full mailing list functionality plus other things).

of course, as an _addition_ an irc-channel would be a nice thing too for 
people who like it that way.

my two cents,
tony

Software, no..   but my web host (affordablehost.com) offers IRC
support.  It is a nice alternative to emailing tech support for help,
because it is staffed by the support staff.  But wow - if you lurk for
even a couple hours, you will notice the same thing being asked over and
over and over....  obviously, no the best way to save/re-use
information.

You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave!

As the numerous footers explain, go to
http://lists.xitami.org/mailman/listinfo/xitami

Scroll to the bottom, it will say, "To change your subscription (set
options like digest and delivery modes, get a reminder of your password,
or unsubscribe from Xitami), enter your subscription email address:" so
you would enter your address and click the Edit Options button. Then on
the Xitami Configuration page that should come up, enter your password
and click Unsubscribe.

Look at the bottom of every email, there is a link to unsubscribe, all you
have to do is click it or copy and paste it into your browser.

Or was it a retorical question.

you have to put every username in there, but you can do that by adding all defined names under the 
directory like
[pub]
     username1 = 
     username2 =

A tip: I just copied the original files ( both )to a separate folder and edited the ones I created 
with only those entries I use.

same here, copy the original to that folder I mentioned above and start the file only with your 
entries like the samples in the original what you are showing below.

Is this your username; upload ?

 here a sample
       Soft-quota = ""
       Use-quotas = "0"

You could use that file, but I wouldn't do that. I know to guess a password is hard, 
but impossible ? I'm using xitami like other people too and we are the good guys, but the bad ones 
who would know about xitami would be able to start trying  the usernames which are there already. 
And that's my reason to put only my own entries in the file. They can guess and try and will give 
up sooner or later. :)

Also, for anyone using an e-mail client that doesn't make the user beg
and plead with it to be able to see the headers, the following lines at
towards the end of the header on EVERY POST to the list:

    List-Help: <mailto:xitami-request@lists.xitami.org?subject=help>
    List-Post: <mailto:xitami@lists.xitami.org>
    List-Subscribe: <http://lists.xitami.org/mailman/listinfo/xitami>,

Just WHY are people nowadays so ignorant about message headers?

Very true; the information is there (AND in the headers) and people ought
not to need to waste the list's members' time answering such inane
queries.

> Or was it a retorical question.

Of course, it could well be that he (nor others) /bother/ to scroll down
to the bottom of the message, especially when there are yards of bottom-
quoted previous posts there, in reverse chronological order.

M$ really fscked up e-mail when they released Outlook Express upon
millions of unsuspecting newbies, and thereby against the rest of the
populace...

Really I don't have much use for the message headers except for what it was
designed for and don't see why people need to hide important information in
the header. The message header was not designed for that purpose and I
expect 70% or 80% of computer users will never see the message headers.

Just as Rod and David I had installed PHP and had the same problem as

I would suggest that in the original distribution line 89 in the
httpdir.gsl is changed too.
This  will  prevent  problems  for other new Xitami/Windows/PHP users.
(Yes,  we  do  exist,  first  we discovered ASP, than PHP...eventually
we'll probably discover linux as well ;-)).

Unfortunately I tried this and while everyone else in that thread said it worked for that 
problem, it is not working for me.  I still get "The URL you asked for does not exist on 
this website" when I try to go to an XML file.

Can anyone help with this any further?

The generate html page, of the list.
The List.html page would have check box next to each file.

I have looked at all the main script sites, and haven't found one that

  First off, and before anything else, make sure your DSL providor will
allow for you to connect a commercial web hosting service. Read your
TOS.

I expect everyone has there own preferences and I'm no execption. One thing
you didn't mention is whether you are on a windows machine or non-windows. I
am on a Win2k pc.

1. I use 1st Class Mail Server at www.1cis.com  It's very easy to use. You
can pay for the domain email as you need them at $65 per domain.
2. look at AIT for domain registration $7.95 per domain I don't think can be
beat. I am a domain reseller but I don't have everything set up just yet.
3. Except for ths software you use, you need to check with your State, to
see if there is any kind of fee. I don't believe there are but you never
know.
4. I'm not sure what that would be? Someone else would have to answer that.
5. Templates, depends on what you want to spend, whether you want to auto
generate certain tasks.

And as someone else said, you need to check your DSL TOS. Know even though
they may have a clause forbidding it, you would probably be fine until your
bandwidth got very high.

Also you have to think about whether your DSL company will give you a static
IP. If not you will have to use a dynamic IP updating service like DNS2GO or
GO2MYDNS. I use both one is a back up of the other. I plan to move to a
business DSL account in the future which will allow the traffic and give me
a static IP. And if you are on a Dynamic IP none of your websites will be
able to send email to AOL customers.

Important to note: even though you might be able to *get away with it*,
when the ISP finally folds your account for TOS reasons, every one of
your hosted websites will cease to be connected to the web. This would
tick me off a lot if I had paid for hosting.

Hi Jeff,

as email server I can recommend Mercury to find  www.pmail.com
It's free and easy to setup. It runs with xitami on one machine here.

For DNS service, wasn't mentioned, I use Zoneedit, up to 5 zones free. They offer 
webforward, mailforward.....  www.zoneedit.com

The rest I can't tell

I didn't see anything on the bellsouth site about bandwidth usage. Since
it's a business account  I'm sure you'll be fine for quite a long time.
Speed will be fine for awhile too. It will take a little longer for users to
pull up a webpage vs being on a T1 or OC3 as in a server farm. Xitami is
pretty fast. The nice thing about DSL is you aren't fighting for bandwidth
with everyone in the neighborhood, unlike cable. I had Time Warner and
everyday about 6pm my connection slowed down to about 56k or at least it
seemed like it. DSL for the most part especially from the phone company
doensn't seem to have a problem.

I hope you're going to upgrade from win98 and either go with win2k, winXP or
win2003. Of course there are other good OS's too.
Ron

As far as IP routing, I recommend taking a look at www.no-ip.com
With No-ip, you have the basic routing service for $20, and other services
like back-up mx, alternate smtp, and a lot more options. Alternate smtp will
let you send your email to those aol users, backup mx will collect your mail
for up to 5 days if your mail server is down.


Hope this helps,
/David

I can tell you I have used Xitami in combination with Mercury mail 
for years on systems from Windows 98 to Server 2003. I still have 
them both running on a Windows 98 system along with Bind to 
provide DNS, Mail and Webservice. Actually Win98 doesn't do to 
bad for this on a small scale. 

Mercury Mail is totally free and good support is available via a 
mailing list with a web archive. Manuals with support are available if 
you want to purchase these. Currently I have Mercury running on 
Win98, XP, 2000 Server and 2003 Server in various configurations.

When we recently registered a new domain we used GoDaddy. I am 
not familiar with a lot of the options, but I am happy with the results 
once I figured out how to get the right settings for our own DNS. It 
was somewhat different than the Network Solutions registration I 
was familiar with when I worked for a local ISP.

Yes you can do this. Put the two in different directories and modify
the portbase of the second one.
In defaults.cfg do the following where XXX is the portnumber you want minus 80
[server]
portbase=XXX

On the other hand are you SURE you want to do this? it may be better
to use Xitami's virtual hosts feature

did you controll the time out settings of your ftp client ? There will be propably 
the problem.

Typically you see WS-FTP connecting correctly to the server (you see the 
hello message), but fails to retrieve a directory list.
Browsers use passive connections, while WF-FTP by default uses active 
connection.
You can set WS-FTP to use passive connections.

I'm not receiving multiples copies.
It could be a faulty connection between your mail client and the POP-3 
server causing the mail to be downloaded multiples times.
A typical POP-3 session involves the download of the messages on the server 
and as last step the deletion of the messages on the server when all 
mesages are downloaded successfully.

Check your mail client to see if it has a setting "dedupe messages".
Check also that the setting "leave mail on server" is OFF

If it still occurs, unsubscribe and subscribe again to the list. Maybe this 
will help.

This makes since, except that my mail service is receiving multiple copies.
Yahoo Mail is getting loads of messages, then outlook downloads them. This
means that it is not with outlook, but with yahoo and the listserv. I will
try unsubscribing and re subscribing.

I just happen to host a few lists myself... and this sort of thing "just happens" from time to time... it's actually quite common.  I've never personally been able to nail down any one particular cause for it, nor have I ever been able to catch my equipment misfiring when the problem's been reported.

I do know how to fix this problem though.

You must sit patiently for a day or two and twiddle your thumbs.
There's something very magical about thumb-twiddling that just makes it go away.

My mailbox is receiving the posts only once, so I'll guess the problem is either with your provider, or somewhere en route to your provider.  I know from experience though, that nobody in that chain is likely to admit knowing anything about it, even if they're able to see the problem happening right in front of them.  Believe a mail-tech as you would believe an information minister from Iraq.

Hope this helps.  Have a nice day!

Message-ID: <BAY16-F3968EED7544D8B34D1A8D1B8770@phx.gbl>

I have been getting attacked on port 80 with "get NT" type request.  The 
attacks increased from once a day to now multiple times.

I want to change my http: 80 port to 9748, which i did and by using my 
current dynamic ip
ip:9748 works.

My question is how to make the change so the
mywebsite.yi.org  goes to  mywebsite.yi.org:9748

In a couple of past list, CNAME was suppose to be added.

yi.org  doesn't provide clear step by step info on how to do this
http://www.yi.org/help/admin/rr.shtml

And I'm either too tired or too stupid to figure it out.  Most likely both.
If someone has experience with yi.org   I would appreciate some help.

I need to use mywebsite.yi.org to serve my perl/cgi dynamic html pages

Thanks in advance for any help

Unless someone changed something on me I think the basic answer to
that is: you can't

DNS resolves hostnames to IP addresses. The same host name could be
used for HTTP, FTP, POP, SMTP etc so there is no way to add a port
component

Check if your dynamic ip provider allows for redirects AKA webforwards.
You need to create at least two records, the standard A record and then a 
non-standard webforward record.

FWIW, the original poster seemed to be conflating mailing lists run under
the auspices of Yahoo!Groups with this one, which is NOT hosted by Yahoo.

I have noticed myself that Yahoo's incoming MX relay mail servers (I
don't use a smart-host for outgoing mail, and receive incoming by SMTP,
not collect it by POP) can be very slow to respond sometimes.  Typically,
of the dozen or so servers that they advertise, connection attempts to
the first 2--4 will time out, and it's only when my outgoing mail client
tries one of the lower priority servers that I can send mail to
Yahoogroups.

If this happens for the mail intended for Yahoo customers too, it's not
infeasible that the SMTP dialogue between Xitami's outgoing mail client
and Yahoo's incoming server might be encountering similar difficulties:
it is an artefact of SMTP exchanges that the sending end may not assume
that the receiving end has safely got the mail until getting the correct
response (after the terminating "." on a line of its own after the DATA
command) and therefore may well resend it.

Definitely a case of the configuration of the recipient's mail system,
but probably not that local to him ;-P

sorry guys, but what is an  "get NT" type request ?
Would some one be willing to explain that to me in more detail ?

There will be others.  My attacks started coming in from all over the
world - too many to simply block.



Best is to setup another A Record (RR record in yi.org?) with your DNS like

    ww2.whatevers.com

pointing to your IP (like your others).

Then set up a forwarding record (WebForward) for
                     www.whatevers.com
 to forward to  http://ww2.whatevers.com:port#/

It is not necessary to "mask" the forwarded address since you have nothing
to hide.

This is done in your DNS service (I use ZoneEdit) but I'm not certain where
yi.org handles web forwarding.

Much Luck.

Why go through all that trouble. Just use your firewall to block the
offending ip address. After I blocked 3 Roadrunner addresses all the "get
NT" type request stopped.

Just a note here, don't confuse attacks with Search Engine Web Crawlers. The
ones that Alex showed clearly appear to be searching for executables. Not
something a Search Engine would be looking for. My problem was when the MSN
search bot hit my sites indexing every page, every image and every day in
the calendar. And although you generally want the search engines to find
your site, I expect not at the expense of eating up bandwidth and slowing
down your server.

Thanks for all the input.  see [Changing Port 80 (d calif)]

I understood that I am to create two ddns accounts one the main account, 
which I already have
mysite.yi.org

A 2nd account that will have the new port i.e.  mysite.yi.org:9948
The 2nd account is supposed to point to whatever my current dynamic IP : 
9948

Or

mysite.yi.org  >  mysite.yi.org:9948  > dynamicIP:9948

ONLY ONE PROBLEM:  I'm either too stupid to figure out how to set this up 
(most likely) or, yi.org cannot handle domain forwarding of this nature.  (I 
have seen ref. search via google where others mention doing the port forward 
at yi.org.)  I cannot see where I can enter the port, either as part of a 
url=mysite.yi.org:9948, or as part of the IP ie  xxx.xx.xxx.xx:9948  either 
of these entries are not accepted.


So I call out for help one more time.  I have created a sample page of the 
yi.org account management screens.  I would be grateful if someone who 
understands what needs to be done, look at the yi.org admin screens and 
yi.org help.  Then explain to me in (NOT vague) but specific steps, how to 
accomplish the forwarding.

YI.ORG  Acct management screenshots
http://snow.prohosting.com/mrmax0/yiorgsrn.html

Note the only place I can enter a port is in the URL:  entry = 
mysite.yi.org:9948, but it did not work either.  Unless I'm suppose to put 
something like
mysite.yi.org = mysite.yi.org:9948    which I have not tried, as I can't 
find anything regarding syntax that explains such an entry.

I have emailed yi.org 3 times requesting help, but no joy there.
(The ddns service is free, so I can't complain too loud.)

Again..... any help is sincerely appreciated!

UPDATE...

My port 80 forward is working!
Tyler MacDonald the owner of Yi.org replied to my support email.

>From the 2 suggestions here on the Xitami mail list, I was 95% complete.
Setting up the 2nd account the correct method.  But one thing left out of 
the entire Yi.Org help or anywhere on the Yi.org site is the answer to this:
""URL:  Webpage to forward hits to. This only has an effect if you set your 
namespace's IP address to the IP address of the yi.org URL forwarding 
server.""

No one is the correct IP for yi.org URL forwarding server.  I pinged, I 
opened up DynSite's yi.org update script, searched google, newsgroups, etc.  
No where could I find that info.

I will insert "Tyler MacDonald's "  reply below, in case anyone else chooses 
yi.org for DDNS.

Some may wonder why I  didn't want to go to another DDNS.  Mainly I like the 
yi short handle, plus yi.org is truely a free source for DDNS with a simple 
and from what I have read reliable approach.

Thanks to those that checked out my page for trying to troubleshoot the 
yi.org setup.

Tyler MacDonald's@yi.org
Q.  Do I setup a 2nd account that is mysite.yi.org:9948 and forward 1st acct 
to
     the new acct?

A. Yes, only it's not a new account, it's a new host.

    Make the 2nd hostname "mrsite2.yi.org" or something. Update your IP on 
that host.

   On the 1st host (mysite.yi.org), make the ip 64.141.0.64 (yi.org's 
forwarding ip), and make the url "http://mysite2.yi.org:9948/". yi.org will 
forward all requests to http://mysite.yi.org/ to that url.

  Hi all,

  I have Xitami Xiwinnt (v 2.4d9) running on NT4. I have PHP 4.2.3
installed, which is up and running.I have installed Squirrelmail 1.43a. The
PHP scripts run. When I call the login page, the logo and entry fields
appear. After I enter the name and password, the system is busy for a short
while and then the screen turns blank. I assume redirection of the PHP pages
does not work. I have overwritten the relative path names by the absolute
names, but this did not make any difference. Is there anybody who can help
me out?
  Thanks in advance.

Newbie can't get FTP working
* I have read through the archieves but can't see to find a conclusive 
answer to my problem.
Works locally, on 2nd computer through router with WAN IP.
But remote friend can only log in, but NOT see directories/folders/files.

My setup:
Xitami:  v 2.5c2
Win98se
Router: Dlink DI-604 (NAT)
DSL / Dynamic IP
Base Port: 8000
HTTP Port: 8080
FTP: cmd : 8021
Router Firewall open ports:
Public 8021=8021 Private
Public 8020=8020 Private
Public 8080=8080 Private

Attempted several things:  *every changed was followed by testing both local 
and remote client.
Both passive and active.
Tried opening up a range of ports starting at 8020.  (My friend's FTP client
kept try ports above 8020, i.e. 8024, 8025, 8023.

ipaddress = "192.168.0.102" (was in the default.cfg) change it to ipaddress 
= "*"

Tried to force the External IP
force-ip = "1"
passiveip = "main IP address"  (then changed it to external IP and tested)

We managed ONE successful remote complete connection.
1st friend set his client: "Force Server IP for PASV mode"
friends FTP client had a "NOTE: Useful for servers with NAT/Non-Routable IP"
* We couldn't get a 2nd complete on connection, because his client kept 
trying a different data port each time, at the time only Server Firewall 
ports 8020 and 8021 were open.  We ran out of time and couldn't continue 
testing.

One potential problem is the following line in the his client log:
friends client log during successful connection, including login, seeing 
directories, and downloaded 10 files.
..............
227 Entering Passive Mode (192,168,0,102,38,192)
    Opening data connection IP: 64.172.148.182 PORT: 9920.
    LIST -aL
150 Preparing to transfer binary file
    128 bytes received successfully. (128 B/s) (00:00:01).
.............
code 227 shows the local IP, I had removed all IP's from the default.cfg.
We saw the local IP every time there was a connection and login, but again 
could not see directories/folders/files.

Message-ID: <BAY16-F2781AD582EC37EAF0E3E64B86D0@phx.gbl>

Reviewing the Xitami docs. in FTP section:
""data-port
    Specifies the port at which data connections will be made. Xitami scans 
for free ports, so this is simply the start of a range of ports. The port is 
shifted by whatever value was used for the server portbase.
    Default: 200.""

In my previous post, I said I opened ports 8020 and 8021.  The data port 
being 8020.  Did I make a mistake?  The docs are saying default is 200??

IN the Xitami.cfg the setting is 20
#   Specifies the port at which data connections will be made. Xitami
#   scans for free ports, so this is simply the start of a range of
#   ports. The port is shifted by whatever value was used for the
#   server portbase.

    data-port=20

I don't understand the reason for 2 different numbers.  If the port is 
shifted from the base port, or in my case 8000, why would there be a default 
of 200 per docs, and 20 in the xitami.cfg??

Thanks for the reply (Alex Barna)

(Alex Barna wrote)
You need the ip address from your ISP.  http://www.whatismyip.com/

1st I have a dynamic IP, so manually getting the current dynamic IP is not a 
solution.  (It would be better that Xitami DDNS module would update the FTP 
module with the current Dynamic IP.

2.nd  We tried this, and still had problem, the interal IP is shown.

I have the same router model, so here is my setup and some questions

1. Do you need another portbase ?
2. do you have setup a dns record for ftp.your site.com ?
3. do you have turned on the ftp server in the advanced tab and forwarded to the 
machines ip ? You ONLY need to enable the ftp server, no messing around with port 20
4. you don't need to open / close in the firewall section of the router; the ports for the ftp 
server or configured through enabling the pre configured ftp server
5. if you enabled the ftp server, did you check the schedule settings ?

Those are some things to test and if you still have some questions, just ask.

Hello Michael,

As you know I'm not the php guy, but I still found your mail ;pretty late reply :( ; and 
thought I give it a try on my system. I still run php 4.3.7  with xitami 2.5c2 on NT4.
I got the "Hello" just fine presented. No error messages from php itself in the error log.

It seems the question now, which programm to upgrade / downgrade ?

Hello List,
 
I want to set up a local web server as the basis of a TCP/IP environment for development purposes.  This seemed to me to be a simple matter, but there seems to be so much I do not know about server configurartion and management.  I am most comfortable with a Setup.exe file which leads me by the hand through the installation process.  I lieu of that, I would like to know where to find step-by-step instructions on how to install and use Xitami Web Server.  And, I mean EVERY LITTLE STEP necessary to implement and understand what I am working with.  Basically, I need a 'Xitami for Dummies' approach.  Can anyone help me with this?
 
Thank you,
Peter Anton

As far as I know there are no major security risks with Xitami, I have used
it for several years without any problem. There are a few Denial of service
vulnerabilities in older versions of xitami but I think most are patched
now. I love Xitami so much I purchased the pro version. There are several
advantages to running Xitami; speed, stability, ease of configuration, but I
think one major advantage of running Xitami is often overlooked. That
advantage is that there is such a small installed base out there that there
is very little incentive for hackers target it.

Subject: [Xitami] How secure is Xitami as a Web Server


Are there any known security risks or issues in using Xitami on Windows 2000
/ XP Pro? I run an LRWP application, but do not run PHP, Python, etc. What
about buffer over-runs, etc?  Has any body ever been "hacked" where the
perpertrators got in through Xitami?

I need proof to show that Xitami is secure before some of our customers will
agree to use it.   Of course, showing them a printout of a post from this
list is not conclusive proof, but it's a start at what to look at.

I seem to remember reading in this list about Imatrix will do some security
updates from time to time.

Thanks,
Brian

It's very difficult to read in a text-only mailer; moreover, it's totally
unnecessary on a mailing list: indeed, some would say that it's
positively sociopathic.

Check your mailer's settings, and get it to post in "Plain text (ASCII)"
when sending to this (or any other) mailing list.

I'm running xitami in XP, and it doesn't happen all the time, but I
get crashes.  I have my computer on 24/7 and the server is used a lot.
 When I'm out of town for a weekend or a week, I often come back to
the error message that xitami has crashed due to a runtime error.  I
would like to know how to track down what is causing it and how to fix
it.  More importantly, though, is that I want to have ti recover by
itself somehow.  I do have the setting enabled to recover silently
from a crash, but this seems to do nothing.  Is there some way of
setting this up in xitami, or maybe through windows somehow?

Thanks in advance,

Steve

Message-ID: <BAY16-F7F0ACA0067C03DCD32C8DB8600@phx.gbl>

Once again, Thanks to ALL offering help and support!!!

FTP now working!   BUT!

First note, I have a dynamic IP.
To get FTP server operating I had to put the external IP in the default.cfg. 
  Also Force IP to on.
In addition Ports 8020, 8021, and range 8020 - 8030 were openned in the 
router.
BUT, having to put the hard IP in default.cfg, means that I will have to 
manually edit the default.cfg every time my dynamic IP changes.  Not a good 
solution.
Here are my default.cfg

[Ftp]
    enabled = "1"
    Limit = "25"
    Pipe = "64k pipe A"
    User-file = "ftpxxxxts.aut"
    ipaddress = "63.163.33.138"
    force-ip = "1"
    passiveip = "63.163.33.138"

Please commit if you have a solution for dynamic IP other than the current 
hard IP I have to use.
I did try putting the domain mysite.yi.org as ip addr, and passive ip, that 
didn't work, could connect but not get the data port working, xitami kept 
returning the local ip.  The only way so far to get the external IP returned 
so passive data transfer on 8020 worked was the above config.

If I am stuck with the above solution, can someone recommend a utility that 
will get a string from a file and then replace a string in another file, 
this has to be all command line or ini file initiated.  I have a Dynamic 
Update Client that saves a IP.txt with the current IP, and the same client 
will execute another program upon update of IP with dns service.  So Update 
client saves IP, utility will grab IP and replace the old IP in default.cfg. 
   (it would be great if Xitami did this with the DDNS module).

Again thanks to all who offered help......

So do I, so I use https://www.dyndns.org/    for outside access.

All I put in defaults.cfg is
[Ftp]
    Enabled = "1"

The rest of the settings work with the defaults in xitami.cfg

To get it to work

All I put in defaults.cfg to get it to work is,

[Ftp]
    Enabled = "1"

The rest of the settings work with the defaults in xitami.cfg
The default address is * which means it uses what ever it is.

Wow, all that work??   All I do is disable the FTP in Xitami and use a real
FTP server like WarFtp.  You should really look into getting a static IP, I
can arrange that for you for only 5.00 a month if you are interested.

Once again, Thanks to ALL offering help and support!!!

FTP now working!   BUT!

First note, I have a dynamic IP.
To get FTP server operating I had to put the external IP in the default.cfg.

  Also Force IP to on.
In addition Ports 8020, 8021, and range 8020 - 8030 were openned in the
router.
BUT, having to put the hard IP in default.cfg, means that I will have to
manually edit the default.cfg every time my dynamic IP changes.  Not a good
solution.
Here are my default.cfg

[Ftp]
    enabled = "1"
    Limit = "25"
    Pipe = "64k pipe A"
    User-file = "ftpxxxxts.aut"
    ipaddress = "63.163.33.138"
    force-ip = "1"
    passiveip = "63.163.33.138"

Please commit if you have a solution for dynamic IP other than the current
hard IP I have to use.
I did try putting the domain mysite.yi.org as ip addr, and passive ip, that
didn't work, could connect but not get the data port working, xitami kept
returning the local ip.  The only way so far to get the external IP returned
so passive data transfer on 8020 worked was the above config.

If I am stuck with the above solution, can someone recommend a utility that
will get a string from a file and then replace a string in another file,
this has to be all command line or ini file initiated.  I have a Dynamic
Update Client that saves a IP.txt with the current IP, and the same client
will execute another program upon update of IP with dns service.  So Update
client saves IP, utility will grab IP and replace the old IP in default.cfg.

   (it would be great if Xitami did this with the DDNS module).

Again thanks to all who offered help......

Then you prpably has NOT port forwarding setup in the advanced tab of your router, or 
do you ?

You don't need to do that. As I desribed in my previous post, you enable the "virtual ftp 
server" in the advanced tab in the router under
1. open the router GUI in the browser
2. click advanced tab
3.scroll down, mark the preconfigured virtual ftp server
4.it should be now shown in the fields above with name ect. You ONLY have to put in 
the ip of your ftp server machine, something like 192.168......NOT the public ip !!
5. just click enable
6. click "apply"
7. in the next window "save settings ?"
8.click " yes"
9. Now your ftp server is ready to get connections.

with the normal configuration, you have to update your DNS settings. That will be in 
your case yi.org ? Is that correct.
I'm using zoneedit.com as my dns service.It's free and lost of features with an easy to 
understand webinterface. I'm running my mail and webserver since 2,5 years with them. 
No problem at all.

FTP now working on virtual domain!  Thanks, Johannes Prost!!

Finally dumped the FTP settings and only had enable, and tried logging in 
using domain.yi.or and port 8 8021 in ftp client..   That worked.

During the initial testing, we had tried using the external IP with 8021 and 
kept logging in, but no directories or data port 8020 connention in pasv. 
mode.  From these test we falsely assumed that a hard IP was necessary in 
the FTP default.cfg settings to make passive FTP possible because of the 
following:

xitami FTP  behind  [router firewall] ----- connecting -----  [user 
firewall] client behind firewall.

As Johannes Prost kept trying to say that none of my previous setting were 
necessary, we finally tried it the SIMPLE way and it worked.

NOTE: I did have to open more than port 8021 and 8020, I had to open a range 
from 8020 - 8030 and if I had more than 3 or 4 FTP users I would have to 
extend the range.  I believe this is necessary due to my tester's FTP client 
software.  Using the hard previous hard IP config, he always received the 
data port on 8020. After changing to domain setup, his client would change 
from 8020  thru 8025, during our test.

Newbie here once again.
I want to install PHP and MYSQL
I d/l PHP 5.0.3 windows installer
ran the installer, and when it came to auto config for Xitami, it couldn't 
find the xitami config.

I proceeded with the install and it said successful install.  Except we all 
know it isn't complete.

I decided that before I go any further, I would ask faithful Xitami fans for 
input regarding installing PHP and MYSQL.

So if you have been through the process I would appreciate comments, or 
guidelines, or "how to".

I am installing both PHP and MYSQL on C:\
Xitami is in E:\xitami

Again any help is appreciated.
P.S.
If any veteran Xitami user would like to collaborate or be available to 
provide some help, via IM (i have both a AIM or Y! accts).  I'm not open to 
putting my info out in public, but if you are interested, in next xitami 
list  give me a "handle" (doesn't have to be complete just first few 
letters, and the AIM OR Y and I will provide a temporty (AIM or Y!) acct for 
you to connect to). Oonce we are chatting I will provide my main IM acct 
info.   I know this sounds hokie, but after you have had personal identity 
info stolen and your credit card used online...  you will understand.

The xitami.cfg file is for reference and lots of info but STRONGLY
recommended not be fooled with.

my php installation added this:

[Filter]
.php=C:\PHP\php.exe

and

[Mime]
Php="application/x-httpd-php"

to my config file.  That's all.  See if this helps.  Add and re-start
xitami.

There may be a php.ini thing that may need to be reset (its in the windows
dir).  A redirect something or other -

  cgi.force_redirect=0

some security thing that killed php function.  Changed it and it worked - no
need to know more.

Good luck,

Charles
Server: php is 4.3.10, xitami 2.5.c2, mySQL 4.0.15 on Win98SE.

PHP successful install!
Main problem.  Forgetting to un-comment
;cgi.force_redirect=0     to    cgi.force_redirect=0

Thanks Charles Schmidling for your help.

Now I will try to install Mysql later today or tomorrow.
As always any help is apprerciated.

I have found out since installinl PHP 5 that, PHP 5 is not "mysql"  ready by 
default.
Had I d/l and installed latest ver of PHP4, PHP4 is "mysql" ready.

I am looking for a simple CMS script to setup and run a site.
I have NO programming knowledge, can get around "dreamweaver" pretty good.

I have been trying to stick with Perl/cgi based scripts, I have used 
"WebApps" on 3 or 4 sites.  I would recommend WebApps to anyone that wants a 
good Perl/cgi portal script.  But WebApps is a Portal, an all or nothing 
script, every install includes Front page, menus, forum, articles, PM, 
downloads, uploads, etc.
I want something a bit more modular.  Easily customized with html based 
templates.
PHP is ok, as 90%  of all the CMS scripts are PHP.

Thanks again for any help........

On Linux/FreeBSD use sendmail-fetchmail-procmail-emacs-gnus

On windows use argosoft-outlook

But don't set up a mailer until you have a good firewall installed and are
comfortable configuring it

Use iptables on FreeBSD/Linux and possibly AT-Guard on Windows - there are
still some free versions
around if you hunt for them from before it became Norton-Symantec

YANB (yet another newbie) here.

Ok I have Xitami up, Perl up, PHP up, Mysql up.
Now I need a CMS (content managment system) that will work with Xitami.
www.opensourcecms.com  lists a bunch of PHP/mysql CMS programs, but most 
require Apache.

I could spend days as YANB trying to get stuff working that just won't work 
with Xitami.

SO please send list your recommendations.

Also if you know of another Perl/Cgi based portal or CMS other than 
www.web-apps.org, please provide that info too.  I have several sites I need 
to build  2 on my Xitami machine, and 2 on hosting services.  On one hosting 
service as a community project, only Perl/cgi is available.  Even though I 
like WebApps, I am looking for an alternative.

Thanks again
YANB
