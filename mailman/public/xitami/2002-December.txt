This, to me, looks like the XITAMI ASCII-Logo as seen in ftphello.txt

Subject: [Xitami] Logfiles: How to use cycle-how=concat?

Hi, I'm currently using the following setup for my logfiles:

[Accesslog]
    Filename = "xyz_de_access.log"
    Cycle-arg = xyz_de_access_%yy%mm%dd.log
    Format = CLFX

So that I will get a logfile for every day. That works fine but
increases the number of files for several domains quite fast. Perhaps it
would be better to have one logfile for each domain where new entries
are concated too. So I tried:

[Accesslog]
    Filename = "xyz_de_access.log"
    Cycle-how = concat
    Cycle-arg = xyz_de_access.archive
    Format = CLFX

But this doesn't work. Any idea where the problem is? Robert

I'm thinking the OP wants a domain name instead of an IP address and
doesn't know what to call it other than "hiding the IP address in the
address bar."  My suggestion is to look around for domain solutions.  I use
<http://www.netsol.com/>, expensive and works as expected but there are
"cheaper" alternatives as well (some of them do covert things like required
pop-up ads).

Hope this helps!

========> excuse me for butting in, but i had to comment on this particular
post.
a friend of mine and i both started running xitami at the same time.
installed it the same day and everything. he's running win2k on an 800mhz
machine with 512/ram, and running xitami in 'normal' mode.

i'm running xitami on an old 400mhz machine, running 98se, with 128/ram, and
running it in 'turbo' mode.

he has had nothing but trouble ever-since his install. constant crashes,
bsod, and many other problems.

i, on the other hand, have not had any trouble whatsoever. my server's very
busy, and he's so mad because everything we do, mine always runs better than
his.

now, personally, i think it's that great-big-overblown-'o/s', otherwise
known as win2k.
i've run win2k before on a very nice system, and i couldn't get along with
it. it's way too cumbersome, and it takes about three times as long to do
anything i can do in seconds on 98se.

i've had people tell me that win2k, me, or xp, is the best thing they've
ever used.  these are people who know nothing about computers, and/or just
love 'purdy'..

i don't do 'purdy'.  as far as i'm concerned, a computer is for work-related
stuff, and i don't have time to sit and wait for 'purdies' to load up just
so people can oooh and ahhh at my screen, background, etc.

if you're running a server, or in my case, a few servers, and all on the
aforementioned system, i recommend you turn off all the purdies and run it
'bland'.  because one thing i learned a long time ago. you can't have the
best of both worlds when it comes to windoze. those worlds are only created
by apple. so if that's what you want, buy a mac. (i love my macs)..

oh and one more thing.. for those who think xp NEVER crashes, and is SO much
better than their previous o/s.  i beg to differ on that too.  xp crashes
more than any other o/s microsloth has ever created.  BUT.. when it crashes,
it's doing it in the background where you cannot see it.  i know, i
beta-tested xp, and i wouldn't run it if it was the last o/s on earth.

two things to remember;
1. any computer sold with a 'restore' cd is a pos from the git-go. if they
already know you're going to need to 'restore',
aka-destroy-all-your-files-and-start-from-scratch, they also know they've
built junk.
2. any operating system which uses half your harddrive for 'restore' files,
is total and complete trash. nuff said...

Message-ID: <8884F496D8BBE84F9E8885E9D6A714B803C831@asi-server.asi.local>

I have a question that I hope you all can solve...
 
Running Xitami 2.4d9 on NT4, PHP 4.0.3 and a webmail app which runs currently under webpages\IlohaMail\source.
 
Here's the problem:
 
If I add an alias of "Webmail" to c:\progra~1\xitami\webpages\Ilohamail\source" I get a blank page with no header, etc.  Just a blank page.  Not even a 404, no errors logged in logfile.  Contents of the blank page are: 
 
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<META http-equiv=Content-Type content="text/html; charset=windows-1252"></HEAD>
<BODY></BODY></HTML>

Also, the same thing happens when I set the alias to the C:\Ilohamail\source and have a copy of it there instead.
 
If I type in the "index.php" I get the text contents of the PHP file (treating it as text).  If I add an Index.html to the folder, it pops up.  Unfortunately index.php is what I need.  When I reference the directory as http://servername/IlohaMail/source I get my perfectly functioning webmail program (when it is a subset of the webpages folder).  However, the way this thing works is there are some config folders I don't want people monkeying around with located under IlohaMail, not just the "source" folder.
 
I have the proper alias setup, I also have the MIME type setup.
 
I installed the XiFusion wrapper (2.6) and the same, nothing.  My direct link still works, but my "webmail" link does not (which currently references the c:/progra~1/xitami/webpages/IlohaMail/source folder).
 
Basically the Alias only seems to work with HTML files, or there is some issue with the PHP, which works for everything else.  I have tried basic PHP files and they all provide the same result.  As if they weren't being called at all.
 
Anybody had experience with this?
 
I am fairly new to PHP so this might be an issue.  But I followed every suggestion on PHP.NET and it does work, just not with Aliases - which leads me to be suspicious...
 
Thanks in advance,
 
Michael Morris

Hi Michael,

Yeah, a few of us have incountered this problem and to which there is no fix
at the moment (from what I have seen). It's really unfortunate, since
aliases are a really powerful feature when you want to expand a website or
provide shortcuts.

I posted on the board about this last month and I also emailed support about
the problem, so far I haven't heard anything to fix this.

Sorry for the bad news, but perhaps someone here has an idea that might just
do the trick.
James

Message-ID: <3.0.1.32.20021203120643.009358d8@mail.mediom.qc.ca>

I'm having problem to have Xitami/PHP returning the $PHP_SELF variable.
(Win2k, PHP 4.2.2, Xitami 2.4d9, MySQL 3.23.39)

Under Apache with the same PHP and MySQL, I'm getting that variable and
other environment ones correctly, but not with Xitami

I need help since I don't want to use Apache and I have absolutely to
install a system (big) with a lot of scripts using extensively that variables.

Here are some values from php.ini:
always_populate_raw_post_data = 0 
disable_functions = no value 
register_argc_argv = On 
register_globals = On 

Any idea to where investigate would be apreciated

Thanks

1) Use Apache. Apache's "alias" is -much- more powerful than
Xitami's. Iloha took advantage of Apache's power, but that leaves
non-Apache users in a bind. FWIW, you can run Xitami and Apache on
the same machine, with different port or IP numbers. I have a
PPro-200 hosting about four different web-servers as well as email
and streaming audio.

2) Wait for the "configurable folders" "bug" on IlohaMail's buglist
to be resolved. There is no reason the app can't keep the public
pages in the public folders and the secret files in non-public
space. But he didn't. He should and it is on his buglist. (And his
code is very well commented. It might be trivial to add folder-opts
and give it to the Iloha community.)

3) Leave the config files out in the open. Surely you don't give
strangers write-permission. Reading is a modest security risk. Yes,
it keeps passwords but not as plaintext: $passkey="6FMKHnEBylfEYg"
email_address:cKJlzWRAcmNpQnJ1cGdlcnMuZWR2 I have not studied what
happens when you use POP Cache-- that might leave messages out in
the open.

4) use the DataBase option. If I understand that, all user-secrets
are then held out in a SQL database with the usual protections.

Paul,

I looked into Apache, and there really is no good excuse for me not to run it, except that the system it is running on is actually even more low powered then your PPro 200 and multiple web servers doesn't quite bode well with me.  I am familiar with Apache 1.3 and I run it on my Linux box, but in trying to do everything from one box with as little overhead as possible - this isn't in the picture.

I read about the bug in Ilohamail.  Yes, you are quite right, there is no reason some of the configs shouldn't be able to be kept elsewhere.  I do have a proper permission and security setup.  However, being the slightly paranoid admin that I am, I really don't like someone being able to call up "Ilohamail/conf/*" files and peek around, as benign as it may be :-).  Currently I am using the MySQL option, and yes everything except configs is stored in the database, very handy.

Anyways, to all who may have been following this.  I completely gave up on the ALIAS function under Xitami.  As it seemed to mainly only work with HTML as I couldn't get any proper PHP files to load up.

Here's what I did - plain and simple.  Setup a DNS entry for webmail.domainname.ca, created a virtual host with the doc root as the Ilohamail/source folder and added it as the CGI-BIN folder as well.  In this config, added the "webmail.domainname.ca" as the DNS reference in Xitami.  Also, created the proper Filter and MIME types for the virtual host, and moved the Ilohamail folder elsewhere on the drive away from the web server root.

That's it - runs like a charm!!! Now I can login to it and it looks as if it is a server off the main domain name.  Pretty cool.

Michael

Another known PHP/Xitami issue.

A pretty simple workaround is the following php-line:
 if(!isset($PHP_SELF)) $PHP_SELF = $_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"];

works.

Sadly, that "transport-neutral encapsulation format" is FOUR TIMES the

Subject: [Xitami] virual domain admin issues
Message-ID: <F28oK5uA7liRtUvh18c00000b30@hotmail.com>

I have multiple virtual domains setup on my server.  The default domain is  
my personal domain and I (obviously) have given that domain FULL admin 
access to the server.  When I setup virtual domains I am trying to setup and 
admin account that will allow the admin to ONLY administer that particular 
domain.  However, I am finding that each virtual domain administrator has 
access to everything for ALL domains.

I can't seem to get a fix for this.  Because when I think I am editing 
something for the virtual domain admin account it is actually affecting 
every account (and server config) for all domains.

Xitami provides the following admin settings, could someone shed some light 
on my above problem and also help define the following settings for me:

Allow web-based admin: ___
IP address Mask: _________________
Superuser Password: ____________

How can I prevent the admin of a virtual domain from seeing all the other 
virtual domains - because as of now, if I allow a vitutal admin account 
acess to the server it is putting that admin at the "root" of the server.  
That admin of that virtual domain has access to all configs for all domains. 
  This is not good.  The superuser password implies that if one is defined, 
then that account (or virtual domain administrator) has access to the rest 
of the server, but that is happending anyway.

Thanx in advance.

Xitami on win98/ActivePerl here.

Is there a simple way for a newbie(me) to instantly pop a local message on 
the servers screen when a visitor clicks a link or loads a page so I know 
they're sitting on a specific page ?

The point was that not only was there the dreaded winmail.dat file
present, but also that the actual text of the post had been encoded into
a binary.  Now I realize that many mailers automatically decode such an
attachment and display it, but mine has to create a separate file, which
I can then chose to examine.  Just think on the fact that such an
automatically-opened binary could equally have contained a virus.

Hi there,
just open your access.log file in any texteditor. when someone accesses 
your site, the file will be changed and the editor notifies you about that. 
Since it is access.log you can also instantly see which resource is being 
accessed and by whom.

Don't works under windows 98.
The notepad editor works for files up to 50kB (very small for a log file), 
becauses it opens the file for reading only.
Workpad fails to open the file becauses it tries to open it for R/W (but 
the file is already open for writing by Xitami).

Solution: add a small script on your page (include it anywhere in your page).
<script src=http://myserver/cgi-bin/popup.exe></script>
popup.exe is a simple program that displays anything you want on your 
screen. It produces no output to the html page.
Xitami starts all cgi programs with window hidden, so your popup.exe has to 
start another program (let's call it popup1.exe) with the window visible. 
This second program has to be started asynchronously, so the calling 
program (popup.exe) does not have to wait for the termination of 
popup1.exe, but can terminate directly. In that way, you can have more than 
one instance of popup1.exe running.

Don't know if you can use perl to display windows messages, i'm using 
powerbasic.

(jk)..

also.. i think you meant 'critique'.. but, no matter.  and no, i'm not being
a smartass, or anything even remotely close. i read this, and have read lots
of other stuff like it and i can't help thinking;  LIFE'S TOO SHORT!

i wonder, and am always amazed at how most people will find the silliest
things to worry and bitch about. especially when there's allot more to worry
about. like for instance..  this country has gone to hell, and we're about 3
months from a 'depression' not just 'recession' as we're in now.  and, on
top of all that, we're about to get blown off the map because all somebody
can say is "my daddy started a war, so i can start several"....

put your priorities where they belong people. use your energy to think about
ways to do something about our gestapo-government..

Even better, find a port of the standard U**x utility "tail"; I know that
it exists for all varieties of Windows, and DOS, and OS/2.  If you run it
in a separate command-prompt window, with the "-f" switch, it will always
display the current "end of the file", even when the latter is extended
by logging activities.

[I suppose that one could also use "tee" to pipe it into a separate
program or script that can look for specific features of activity.]

The simple answer is no, you can't do it.

Front Page is an abomination; Front Page Extensions are doubly an
abomination, since they are a means for Microsoft to force you to use
their crappy, security-ignorant, and bug-ridden IIS as a web server.

Anything that can be done in FPE can be done, probably better, in real
HTML with SSI and other techniques.

My friend runs a site that uses Xitami. He offers some large files for downloading, and the
download often dies before it finishes, but using a download manager like DAP wont let me resume
files from his site. is this related to Xitami, or something else?

I don't believe the FTP functions under Xitami include resume. I use another
product Serv-U for that very reason.

My friend runs a site that uses Xitami. He offers some large files for
downloading, and the
download often dies before it finishes, but using a download manager like
DAP wont let me resume
files from his site. is this related to Xitami, or something else?

i didn't mean downloading via FTP, i mean a normal HTTP download. when i use DAP, it says "Resume
not supported". i was wondering if a switch to apache would allow users to resume downlods?

Hi all,

I have the same problem with my site. If i download from the LAN no problem
but from internet it never finishes download. Same thing using DAP.
I think it is related to my Firewall/Proxy.
So i am trying several ones now. I had WinroutePro, if any of you has some
tips
for a good Firewall/Proxy that works as service in W2K, please share.

The best firewall I ever tried was Zonealarm.
It is not a Proxy and it works partially as a service, but.... IT`S JUST
GREAT DOING THE JOB.

Then you can use a little Proxy as ANALOGX `s to acces the internet.

Ive tried Zonealarm with all AVIRT proxies (soho, gateway. etc) and
Analogx`s, and it was always great.

The only thing I had to drop a time ago was W2K :)))) The problems were
always there.

Big warning to anyone thinking of using AnalogX proxy: at one time, this
was distributed such that the default configuration would allow an open
SOCKS proxy; many people have found to their cost that their computer was
being hijacked to relay spam/UCE by news and e-mail --- the first they
would know was when their ISP would cut them off for misusing the
service.

The author seemed quite unconcerned about this, and had no means of
contacting the thousands of users that already had this product and were
vulnerable.  I hope by now that the documentation has been made clearer,
and that the default configuration does not include the open SOCKS.  All
the same, current and potential future users are urged to check that
their systems are not acting as wormholes for the spammers!

No, it is not. I've deployed Bugzilla 2.14 successfully on a Windows 
NT machine. The main problem is that you have to hack your way through  
the mail sending routines - they are written with sendmail in mind. 
Because I didn't want to mess with Sendmail for Windows, I replaced 
the calls with the respective functions from the Perl SMTP package. 
And there are several other places of Unix-specific code, which can be 
either bypassed at all or easily modified. 
The other catch is that Bugzilla 2.16 is not available for Windows 
yet. But it seems that 2.14 is capable enough - I believe the main 
problems were some security issues. Of course, the Bugzilla site lists 
more on the differences between versions.

[I don't quite understand why the poster of this seems to have
reforwarded something that hadn't otherwise been circulated to the list.
Fruthermore, his "upside-down" posting style makes understanding the
context difficult, so I've edited it into something easier to
understand.  Oh, I've also edited out superfluous stuff, which is
something that he ought to have done: after all, there's little point in
having a "cascade" of Yahoo's closing text, is there?

<http://www.geocities.com/nnqweb/nquote.html> is just as applicable to

Sigh!  You seem to be in some difficulty in understanding Internet
terminology.

SOCKS != sockets.

The AnalogX product, inter alia, provides an open SOCKS proxy.  Anyone
connecting to this on the appropriate port can use the proxied machine to
post spam.  The spam is then relayed via the owner's usual ISP's servers
as if originating from him/her.

AnalogX is *dangerous* in the hands of the uninitiated.

Certainly it CAN be configired so as not to have the open SOCKS proxy;
however, the great majority of Windows users would probably have no idea
whether they wanted SOCKS or not, and quite likely leave the system with
the default configuration.  Since the product as originally distributed
left this dangerous option switched on by default, I felt it necessary to
remind potential users not to accpe the default without further thought.

> Then you use it behind the firewall.

What?  Something like ZoneAlarm (which is also dangerous in the hands of
most of its users, although usually only to the extent of worrying them
through reporting false positives)?

99% of "home Windows systems" that are equipped with a "firewall" are
really using a chocolate fireguard, if they hope for the firewall to run
on the same machine that is supposedly being "protected".

Once again, SOCKS != sockets.

The best firewall I ever tried was Zonealarm.
It is not a Proxy and it works partially as a service, but.... IT`S JUST
GREAT DOING THE JOB.

Then you can use a little Proxy as ANALOGX `s to acces the internet.

Ive tried Zonealarm with all AVIRT proxies (soho, gateway. etc) and
Analogx`s, and it was always great.

The only thing I had to drop a time ago was W2K :)))) The problems were
always there.

As Pink Floyd "hey you!"

I`m aware now that either I missed the point or this is another kind of
list.

While I post my opinion or best guess, trying to give any help, you take my
mail, anal ize it and then write a detailed answer, that is supposed to
help... WHO? ME?

About the unsecurity of the SOCKETS you SOCKs with, I don`t quiet understand
how they will manage to be used as spam bridges behind a decent firewall.

Besides the answer was already given, that who was asking, can probably
manage quiet well this security issues.

So please stop posting this kind of  mail. If you want to test somebodys
patience, try to write to me personaly.

For me this discussion ends here, I dont have the time to read more of your
posts, and less time to do your funny job that aparently looks for reasons
to laugh at the others good will.

Carlos

PS: Sockets and socks is my fault.
SORRY
 I speak spanish but know where to find the ones and the others and manage
quiet well with them.
 If one has to be so critical, can probably show some respect in the way of
pointing faults. No need to offend
Like :  open sockets are used in A..x proxy and CAN be used in spam
bussisnes.
           open socks gives acces to critical parts of kernel, making
possible to make flows of packets against other victim resulting in  denial
of service.

Very easy;

First go to the webadmin interface and "security"
Check the password filename (assumed default.aut)

Second
In the root directory of Xitami, open the file default.aut

Each directory to be protected has an entry

[directory_name]
     User_name=user_pasword

You can have more than one directory to be protected, and more than one 
user with different password per directory.

Hi,

When I run Xitami and its cgi program on a laptop computer, winlogon.exe
starts taking %90 or more
of the CPU time (for several seconds) as soon as my cgi program exchanges
data with Xitami.

But I don't have this problem when they run on a desktop!

Has anyone had this problem?

Does anyone know if there are certain configuration parameters on
Xitami that need to be set to avoid this problem?

Or is there a bug on winlogon.exe (on laptop)?

appreciate any suggestion.

Ali

Maybe the network configuration is not right. Maybe it's waiting for a WINS 
server?
Even with a faulty network configuration, the computer will boot up. Some 
services like file sharing
can be unavailable, other that don't rely on windows (like Xitami) will be 
operative.
When the cgi needs to access a resource, windows rely on WINS and/or DNS to 
find it. If the server is not found, windows will still find it by 
broadcast, but this can take some time.

Try to duplicate the network configuration from your desktop.

Subject: [Xitami] RedirectPermenant?
Message-ID: <000901c2a145$07dc2b00$0400a8c0@utku>

Hi,
I'm looking for a function similar to RedirectPermenant (.htaccess) in Apache
servers. I'd rather not use HTML pages with meta-refresh tags. Is this possible
under Xitami?

Thanks in advance,

Marc,

The way I run Xitami:

locally on a laptop with no connection to LAN or other type of networks.

I looked at the "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties" , "Advanced",
"WINS"
and there are NO addresses added on "WINS addresses, in order of use"
section.
but "Enable LMHOSTS lookup" and "Enable NetBIOS over TCP/IP" are checked
on.

also question about Xitami network configuration. Are they setup in
xitami.cfg file ?

thanks

The laptop is the computer that doesn't work correctly, right?
What is the difference with the desktop?
If you don't have connection to LAN, you should uncheck all windows protocols.
NetBIOS is used for resolution of windows ressources.
Best is to disable the network interface.


>also question about Xitami network configuration. Are they setup in
>xitami.cfg file ?
The only network thing to be configured is the ip address and port on witch 
the server will listen. Leave like it is. (use all available addresses and 
default ports).
Virtual hosts is another network configuration, but has nothing to do with 
winlogon (or with windows).

Any other way except CGI? I'm looking for a server configuration setting, if
there is one. But I guess there isn't. =\


On a side note, could people please send their messages to the list as PLAIN

Xitami 2.4d9 on Windows 95 OSR2.  This is a 2nd and fresh installation, for 
testing this specific bug.
2.5b4 is too instable for me to use (crashes often).

This is what is in my defaults.cfg:

#*END
[Accesslog]
     Format=$(client), $(user), $(mon)/$(day)/$(year), $(file)

[Errorlog]
     Format=$(client), $(user), $(mon)/$(day)/$(year), $(file)

[Security]
     Filename=defaults.aut

[Server]
     Webpages=d:\zerion


When I hit several pages, and look in the access log, this is what I see:
, , //,

, , //,
, , //,

, , //,

Did I do something wrong? or is this a bug?  All other formats other than 
Custom-format work properly.

Content-Type: text/plain;

I cannot get $PHP_SELF to work when running Xitami on my PC. I have a PHP
program which includes a form with the following action: -

<form action= "<?php $PHP_SELF ?>" method="post">

When I run the program I get a "The Page Cannot Be Found" message with the
address bar set to:

><br%20/>

I am running Xitami v2.5b4  on a stand-alone XP PC.  When I run the same
code at an external PHP server it works and re-opens the original page. Is
there something missing from my version of PHP or Xitami?

Regards

I personally don't know much about PHP but this 
is from a previous post----
    "Another known PHP/Xitami issue.

A pretty simple workaround is the following 
php-line:
if(!isset($PHP_SELF)) $PHP_SELF = 
$_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"];       
works.

Is there a way to have Xitami create logs in the W3C log file format?

Or more specifically, I want to separate the cs-method from the URI-stem 
and everytime logs are rotated, put about 4 lines of comments in the top of 
of the log file.

Any way to do this or any plans for Xitami to do this?

What version of Xitami are you using?

If your using 2.4X you can't give restricted admin access.  With 2.5X 
you can.  Also with 2.5X you can write GSL scripts that will handle 
this.  I personally have made a PHP script to writes client's options to 
the text files that control Xitami.

Thanks, I assume v2.5 comes with proper documentation on this?  I will be 
downloading v2.5 this weekend and upgrading my server which is on v2.4 at 
the moment.

For clarification, does restricted admin access permit an individual admin 
per domain? And is that admin only allowed to administer that domain?

Subject: [Xitami] xitami on Linux newbie
Message-ID: <LDENLEJIMGGJNINOJCFNEEJDCAAA.bare1@cox.net>

Yet another newbie raises his innocent head.....

Hi,

I have been "volunteered" at work to get a linux box up and running with
Samba, Tight VNC, ARKEIA Tape Server, and of course, Xitami. I have read so
much "geek-speak" documentation it's hard to remember what option is for
what server! (There... I feel better now!)

Is there a generic "Start / Kill" script out there that someone can point me
to, so that if I need to use VNC to cause the box to reboot, Xitami will
start similar to SMB or HTTPD on the way up? I'm willing to try my hand at
editing a workable script, but I'm not "there" yet when it comes to writing
things from scratch. Of course, if someone has tips and hints as to how to
make Xitami start at boot without adding a Start script, that would be very
cool! At the moment, I log in as the user that installed Xitami and cd to
the directory it's in, and manually kick off xitami -b 5000 -s.

To recap: I need to have Xitami start as a service in run command levels 2-5
as the machine boots.

Thanks for any and all support!

Some time ago I wrote an url file (Internet shortcut) parser to use with
Xitami.
http://home.fortech.lv/~andris/redirect/

To use - add in [Filter] section 
    .url=url.exe
I see it usefull to add in [Server] section default for index.url files as last
one.

Do not use hyperlinks to clean .url file because it does not work in Netscape
4.xx browsers.

Message-ID: <OFC834159A.1F0BB1E9-ON85256C8D.0079D09A@on.ing-canada.com>

I have a problem with receiving ASCII files with a xitami ftp server.  It
is version 2.4d9 and running on NT 4 SP6a.
The problem is with the carriage return line feed CRLF.  Xitami replaces it
with line feed LF.
I did found that question on this mailing list but never the answer.
I guess there is a way to change that behavior or get xitami to put a CRLF
but I don't know how.
Please answer my question even if the answer is as dull as :  "Well, change
your ftp server."

The [Filter] was a complete mystery fpr me upto now. I learned something
entirely new. 
Thanks.

Do you know whether there is any difference in overhead between eg a
perl cgi executable and a 
perl filter activated as you describe?

This choice seems to depend on whether you'd like to redirect 301
against individual 
document uris or complete directory uris.

A cgi script also offers the possibility of by-passing document
extensions and redirecting
complete virtual directory content through a cgi-alias (document or
directory name) to a 
script which would output headers for 307 with the appropriate choice of
location
depending on the path requested ( this would be in the environment extra
path ).

To Utku Uzmen:

I am sorry if there is any html formatting in my mail. This is Netscape
with the text editor
and I do not notice any formatting on my own copy. Please warn me if I'm
mistaken.

I don't quite understand your question. Xitami is a server, so you (or 
somebody else) put files on it so the whole world (or a subset of it) can 
get them. Do you mean that the files you download from your own server have 
lost their CRLF, replaced by a LF?

I don't think Xitami changes anything in the files.
It doesn't even know what a CRLF in a file is, it just see files as a chunk 
of binary data.
Probably the files were created using Unix?

The only difference is that cgi executes from a special cgi-bin location,
filter - from any other with specific file extension.

The reason I wrote a such tool is that www is a living media. Some pages
dissapeers, some moves to another locations. Many search engines keeps old, non
working urls for a log time. To avoid errors I use this redirector.
In a such way http://home.fortech.lv/uvis/ redirects to http://www.uvis.lv/ ,
http://www.safequipment.com/ to http://www.saftehnika.com/ ,
http://home.fortech.lv/~aparats/ to http://www.aparats.lv/ etc.

FTP has two modes: Text and Binary.

In Binary, the file on the server is the same as the file on the
client. Exact copy.

In Text, the FTP process "helpfully" translates line-breaks from the
source machine's convention to the destination machine's convention.
>From your description, you are sending files from DOS(Win) to Unix.
DOS uses CRLF, Unix expects LF, so a Text-mode FTP transfer will
convert the line-breaks.

In any decent FTP client, you can specify the mode before you start
the transfer. command "bin" or "mode bin" on dumb-terminal FTP
programs, a check-box in WS-FTP and MacFetch and other good FTP
clients. If you use MS IE as an FTP client, you probably are stuck
with what MS IE/ Windows thinks is best for you.

FTP servers and clients default to Text mode. In the dumb ones, you
have to remember to set BIN mode before you transfer. Smart ones
have "Auto-Guess" (based on extension or heuristics) and usually you
can set them to default to Binary on ALL transfers.

If I upload from DOS to unix and plan to use vi to edit the file on
the unix box, I'll use the Text Mode. At least back in 1981, the
port of vi that I used was not happy with CRLF files unless I
invoked some options. (I bet that's been improved.)

But in almost all cases, I do all my editing on the DOS/Win box, and
the unix box is just storage. In that case, I use BIN mode, so when
I send the file up and take it back down, it comes back the same.
(In theory FTP Text both up and down will also convert-convert and
come back the same, but often not.) That also avoids thinking about
what files are text: my way, ALL files are "binary" and handled
without translation.

> Please answer my question even if the answer is as dull as :
> "Well, change your ftp server."

Well no, that won't help. ALL standard FTP servers must support Text
mode and default to that. Perhaps you could find one that doesn't.
And perhaps if your FTP server runs on DOS/Win it will keep the same
line-breaks. (Though I think some FTP servers "assume" that
server-stored files should be in unix format.)

I would say: change your Editor (or whatever is saying it "must"
have CRLF). Any decent text editor will swallow any of the
line-break conventions: DOS, unix, Mac, and optionally save in any
of those formats. On Winders I like UltraEdit, though I have used a
1984 DOS text editor.

The files were created using MVS.  The previous version of Xitami did
receive the file with CRLF.
It is only after upgrading to the last version of Xitami that the problem
appeared.
They're the same files send from the same mainframe, received on the same
NT but with LF rather than CRLF.

I don't quite understand your question. Xitami is a server, so you (or
somebody else) put files on it so the whole world (or a subset of it) can
get them. Do you mean that the files you download from your own server have

lost their CRLF, replaced by a LF?

I don't think Xitami changes anything in the files.
It doesn't even know what a CRLF in a file is, it just see files as a chunk

of binary data.
Probably the files were created using Unix?

I agree with you completely.  But there is my problem :  when the "FTP
process "helpfully" translates line-breaks from the
source machine's convention to the destination machine's convention." it
does not.  To be more specific Xitami used to but do not anymore.

In this case, the sender is an MVS and the receiver is an NT.  The files
have to be transferred in ASCII.  If the transfer mode is set to bin I will
get EBCDIC, I tried !  The files used to be received by an older version of
Xitami and they contained CRLF.  The latest version of Xitami receives them
with LF.  I even tried an ASCII transfer from windows to windows of a file
containing CRLF.  After the FTP transfer it was containing LF !  From
windows to windows !  FTP transfer shouldn't do that.  Xitami shouldn't do
that.

> But I still need Xitami to put CRLF instead of LF.  How do I change that
?

FTP has two modes: Text and Binary.

In Binary, the file on the server is the same as the file on the
client. Exact copy.

In Text, the FTP process "helpfully" translates line-breaks from the
source machine's convention to the destination machine's convention.
>From your description, you are sending files from DOS(Win) to Unix.
DOS uses CRLF, Unix expects LF, so a Text-mode FTP transfer will
convert the line-breaks.

In any decent FTP client, you can specify the mode before you start
the transfer. command "bin" or "mode bin" on dumb-terminal FTP
programs, a check-box in WS-FTP and MacFetch and other good FTP
clients. If you use MS IE as an FTP client, you probably are stuck
with what MS IE/ Windows thinks is best for you.

FTP servers and clients default to Text mode. In the dumb ones, you
have to remember to set BIN mode before you transfer. Smart ones
have "Auto-Guess" (based on extension or heuristics) and usually you
can set them to default to Binary on ALL transfers.

If I upload from DOS to unix and plan to use vi to edit the file on
the unix box, I'll use the Text Mode. At least back in 1981, the
port of vi that I used was not happy with CRLF files unless I
invoked some options. (I bet that's been improved.)

But in almost all cases, I do all my editing on the DOS/Win box, and
the unix box is just storage. In that case, I use BIN mode, so when
I send the file up and take it back down, it comes back the same.
(In theory FTP Text both up and down will also convert-convert and
come back the same, but often not.) That also avoids thinking about
what files are text: my way, ALL files are "binary" and handled
without translation.

> Please answer my question even if the answer is as dull as :
> "Well, change your ftp server."

Well no, that won't help. ALL standard FTP servers must support Text
mode and default to that. Perhaps you could find one that doesn't.
And perhaps if your FTP server runs on DOS/Win it will keep the same
line-breaks. (Though I think some FTP servers "assume" that
server-stored files should be in unix format.)

I would say: change your Editor (or whatever is saying it "must"
have CRLF). Any decent text editor will swallow any of the
line-break conventions: DOS, unix, Mac, and optionally save in any
of those formats. On Winders I like UltraEdit, though I have used a
1984 DOS text editor.

Andris, thanks for the link--it looks like something that could prove useful. I

can use something like
http://www.this-site.com/error?302:http://www.someplaceelse.com/
for redirecting with a 302.

Ayhan, I wasn't referring to you when I asked people not to post in HTML. Your
client seems to work properly, i.e. only plain text. =) People who use Hotmail,
for example, seem to post in HTML by default. Well, anyway, I guess we might

Some time ago I wrote an url file (Internet shortcut) parser to use with
Xitami.
http://home.fortech.lv/~andris/redirect/

To use - add in [Filter] section
    .url=url.exe
I see it usefull to add in [Server] section default for index.url files as last
one.

Do not use hyperlinks to clean .url file because it does not work in Netscape
4.xx browsers.

I tried an ASP-lookalike product about two years ago: cannot currently
remember the name, but still have the files at my place of work.  It may
have been iASP (is that "Instant ASP", from some company with something
to do with honey or bees in its name?)

> Cause I`ve got a little problem. And wanted to ask about it

We had to give up on it, because the VB support therein did not support
many of the objects and methods that are second-nature to "normal" ASP
"constructions".  Pity really, because we would have liked our students
NOT to have had to associate with M$ IIS.

In particular, IIRC, there was no Session object, which makes life a
teensy bit difficult.

As someone else has already asked, please do not post in both ASCII and
HTML.  You need to go into your mailer's settings and select "Send plain
text only".  Most people (especially those on LISTSERVs) will thank you
for it.

No, not that I've heard of.  You have to restart the web server for some 
changes to take effect.  Of course, you could also have it refresh 
configuration after some period of time; but your web server would be down 
for that period of time that it is refreshing.

Normally, when I answer my own question, I have a bad habit of not sharing 
with the list.  Lately, however, it appears that the regular repliers, 
aren't either.

After playing with several products this is what I have learned:

- 2.4d9 does not support custom log formats.  It's broke.
- 2.5b5 does.
- W3C format is IIS's default log format.  There aren't many web server's 
to-date that can write in W3C format (including Apache) and here's why: The 
format consists of several lines of comments at the head of each rotated 
log file, similar to this:

======================
#Version: 1.0
#Date: 12-Jan-1996 00:00:00
#Fields: time cs-method cs-uri
00:34:23 GET /foo/bar.html
12:21:16 GET /foo/bar.html
12:45:52 GET /foo/bar.html
12:57:34 GET /foo/bar.html
======================

W3C is IMHO a pretty robust format, but impossible to duplicate.  These 
comments are critical to understanding the W3C log format; especially 
#Fields.  The format allows any field, in any order, as long as it's 
declared at the beginnin of the log file.

2nd reason is, Xitami (and I think Apache, too) don't separate the "method" 
from the "uri", where "method" is the "GET" or "POST" part of the request, 
and the "uri" is the "/foo/bar.html".  In Xitami it's just $(request) for 
both concatenated.

More specifically, with W3C you could do:
=========================
#Fields: time cs-uri
00:34:23 /foo/bar.html
12:21:16 /foo/bar.html
12:45:52 /foo/bar.html
=========================

With Xitami you can't:
$(time) $(request)
=========================
00:34:23 GET /foo/bar.html
12:21:16 GET /foo/bar.html
12:45:52 GET /foo/bar.html
=========================

So unless a custom format allows you to place comments at the top, and 
allow you to separate the "method" from the "uri", Xitami can't do it.  But 
don't feel too bad, Apache can't either.


Hope this helps anyone else out.

No, there's not a way I've heard of to do that with Windows 98.  The 
closest you could come to is by using a NTFS file system to somewhat 
emulate the permissions; but an FTP server running on that machine would 
have to translate permissions into a Unix-style.

It's really a different permissions system.  Is there a way to hack your 
cgi script?

Windows 95/98/Me doesn't have the security settings that Linux has.
Windows NT/2000/XP doesn't either, but the security is a whole lot better
than 95/98/Me...

In other words, your script running on Win98 does not need to be chmod'ed
since there is no such thing as permissions in the FAT32 file system.
Almost every file on a Windows system is 775'd (777 in some cases where
someone has decided to share their C drive with Full Control to everyone
via NetBIOS on a LAN...).

Hope this helps!

Message-ID: <OFE7E80D70.19D60E13-ON85256C92.005C0F2D@teal.com>

Hi,

Xitami runs when I have a physical internet connection but gives me
this message " Could not open port 80 - Port is already used by another
server (WSAEADDRINUSE) "
when there are no internet connection.

I did change the portbase to 1000 but still gave me the same error with a
new port 1080.

Any help is appreciated.

Got a firewall ? Got a file sharing program running ?

Could always use apache, it allow you to specify the exact port number.

I really need help with this one.

The documentation for 2.5b5 is behind a minor version 2.5b4....

I am trying to create a custom log format for a product that will interface 
with Xitami.  We can't figure out what $(stime) and $(service) are.  Is 
there a list of all the log variables that can be used?

More specifically, I'm looking for a variable that just has the URI stem of 
the request.

In $(request) I get:
GET /whatever_it_is.cgi?something_something

I just want:
/whatever_it_is.cgi

You don't need Sendmail.  What you need is the the Perl Package Module: 
"libnet".  In libnet you wil find library functions ranging from SMTP to 
SNMP.

Assuming you have Perl running on your system, go to the Perl directory and 
execture the PPM.bat file.  In the PPM window, type "install libnet" - 
assuming that computer has a connection to the internet, ppm will go out and 
auto install the libnet module.

Because his mail program is set for multipart/mixed vice plain text. You're
actually getting the text as the attachment.

It does: a text-only footer which claims:

Depending on your reader, this may be showing in-line below B's
typing, or as a separate part, or may be discarded because there is
a line of three dashes above it.

In B's post at 17 Dec 2002 20:16:49 -0600 I see the Virus note both
as an attachment and in his quote of Dan's words (however Dan's post
does not have the virus footer), along with the Xitami-list and MSN
footers.

Really?  That's interesting; I'm using Eudora and I have it specifically 
ask me whether it wants me to send in "Plain", "HTML", or "Both".

Did it happen with this message?  I'm specifically choosing "Plain".

yep - it shows an attachment - but there's no attachment to open (i'm using
outlook express)....

must be the message tag the virus scanner is adding after you send the
message.

Subject: [Xitami] Beginner question (Virtual Host?)
Message-ID: <VA.00000017.02212c32@datacomm.ch>

Hello all,

I just installed Xitami on my NT 4.0 SP6 Computer.
Every thinks look good. 

I created my first local web.

I have the two following files:

Myweb.cfg
*********
#*END

[Security]
    Filename = "ateho.aut"

[Server]
    Webpages = "d:/web/ateho/"

[Wsx]
    Admin = ""

myweb.aut
*********
#   Created by Virtual Host wizard
[/Admin]
  admin=-
[/Setup]
  admin=- 
  
Now, how can I run this web on my PC?

I tried: http://127.0.0.1/myweb, http://myweb, but nothing 
happen. I get one error message: 
"The URL you asked for does not exist on this website"

What do I make wrong?

Many thanks in advance for your help. 

Regards

Otto

http://127.0.0.1 should open a main-page. Does it?

Virtual Hosts will not work locally unless you trick DNS.

The easiest way is to open your "hosts" file. On WinXP it is
C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts, and I think NT4 had it the
same place. It has some #comments, and then a line for "localhost".
Add a line for each V-host, all pointing to 127.0.0.1. Like this:

 # Copyright (c) 1993-1999 Microsoft Corp.
 # This is a sample HOSTS file

 127.0.0.1       localhost
 127.0.0.1       myweb

Save the changed "hosts" file, then try http://myweb in your
browser.

Message-ID: <20021218150634.D12322@garcia.efn.org>

* I'm using Xitami/Pro v2.4d10 on a Win2k server.

* The server is up for ssl purposes only, the main site is 
running on Apache.

* The header/left nav/footer use the same set of images as the main site.

My problem is that not all the images load in the browser when retrieving a page from the Xitami process, but all images load fine when retrieving the same page via the apache process. 
my config:
[Server]
    Cache-defaults=0
    Default1=index.php
    Default2=index.html
    Webpages=secure
    limit=0
    advertize=0
    keep-alive-max=500
    timeout=180
    priority=3

Any and all help or even just random thoughts will be appreciated.
Thanks

hi,
Just some thoughts.
Check the xitami logs after requesting a certain page (with images). Are all
images being served?
Does this happen to the same image? how did you name you image files? If you
press reload/refresh does the missing image come up?
Re: your config, could you be missing
	keep-alive=1                         #   1 = use Keep-Alive on ports

THe keep-alive=1 setting didn't change anything.
I would like to add that if I right click on a given unloaded image
and choose "Show Picture", the image loads up just fine.

The images that dont load (and it seems to be random) are not stored as requests in the access log, the others are. 

after further testing it seems to only happen to machines that are connected to my local network. so perhaps it is not a xitami issue after all.

Thanks for the suggestions.

There are instructions on unsubscribing on the bottom of every message,
and in the announcement email you were sent when you signed up.  And
failing that you could email the list administrator (ie, me) and ask to
be removed.  

Repeatedly disturbing everyone on the mailing list is rather rude.

I've removed billy@1.www1.biz from the mailing list, although I notice
there are other users at that domain as well.  Unless I hear otherwise
I'll assume that they're still interested.

Hi there, I have a webmail running under correo.zonacharrua.com  (or
webmail.domain.com)

First make sure that your "webpages\IlohaMail\source", is define as cgi-bin
directory or path, that (with the proper configuration), will allow
execution of scripts.

Second you must have PHP support installed and configured in Xitami. The
latest instalations of PHP will do just fine.

If you put your Index.php as one of the defaults pages and It continues to
be treated as text, that means your cgi-bin dir + php is not properly
configured.

If you want I can send you a mail, so you can look at my files syntaxis.

Hope you manage..

Carlos

Hello Gunnar,

Most 3rd party FTP Daemons will allow file resume.  Try WAR_FTP it is
by far the best FTP Daemons available.

About the proxy, you can choose to use the sockets or not.

Then you use it behind the firewall.

At last you can get a very good tool from http://grc.com wich can close the
infamous sockets.

Is there a way to have Xitami create logs in the W3C log file format?

Or more specifically, I want to separate the cs-method from the URI-stem 
and everytime logs are rotated, put about 4 lines of comments in the top of 
of the log file.

Any way to do this or any plans for Xitami to do this?

Seems like 1080 is also a commonly used port... try 5080 or make sure
that you don't have another http server running.. are you using win or
linux?

Cannot be done and there will be NO support for this I am sure.  It has
been an issue here at Xitami for quite some time and the answer is
always the same NO FP EXTENSIONS, an in my opinion I am glad as they are
insecure, bulky and lanky and most off Micro$oft.

This is not true either, FP extensions will run on Apache, as well as

Not true, frontpage extensions is a module that can be installed onto a=20
webserver.

All my apache webservers support frontpage extensions and asp applications,=20
this is true for the unix and pc versions.  We converted all our Micro$oft=20

The problem was that people using programs like DAP (Download Accelerator Plus) cant use the
Resume option when downloading files throught normal HTTP. The server is just a normal computer
running Windows XP and Xitami on a cable connection (he knows its against the contract with the
cable company, but as long as he dosen't sell hosting accounts they dont mind). There is no
firewall or proxy thing, but users can't use the resume on any media files (.avi, .mpg, .mp3). How
can he enable this?

Hello !

It is probably not a Xitami issue.
My server (Xitami v2.4d9) runs fine for weeks or months, serving millions 
of pages a day (daylogs are approx. 1MB in size) on W2Kserver SP3 and 
calling cgi-bin scripts.

Older mailings on this list suggests that maybe the network interface card 
is defective.

Hello !

I'm in the repair business (not software).
When a computer works normally and then crashes, it is generally a hardware 
problem.
Software don't go defective after some time: the instructions that makes up 
the program don't get corrupted, but a defective memory chip can cause such 
problems (or a overheated processor, or a failing hard drive or an power 
supply with dried condensators or ...)

Of course it can also be a combination of some software that don't work 
well together. Is there some other software running on the server?
But since i'm using w2k and xitami and never experienced a crash, it can't 
be Xitami and/or windows alone: the error should be duplicated on my server 
since we both use the same software.

since xitami is the only software with a problem on this server, it seems
that it is the one with the problem. xitami has ALWAYS done this on any of 6
computers I have ran it on. you can not be telling me that since everything
else works fine, and that all six computers have hardware problems. so since
it is crashing an all the computers, nothing else is, what do you recommend?

I recommend using another webserver (Apache is also free and there is a 
very small server at AnalogX for testing purposes).
Are you using other software with your webserver (cgi? database? streaming 
audio?)
If you want to stick to Xitami try a clean install, run the service packs 
for Windows and install Xitami again.

I have crashed Xitami fairly frequently on Win2k.  With V 2.5b5 there is 
seems to be a memory management bug where it appears to fail to cope 
gracefully when it can't get any more mmory. I don't know all the 
circumstances behind this bug and I can't realy be bothered to debug it 
(though it seems that the XML processing suffers most from the bug) as I 
have a perfectly good work around. The work around is to not use Xitami 
on a mahine which uses a lot of memory for other things - or if you do 
to expect occasional crashes so automatically restart when required.

I have found that on the whole Xitami uses LESS memory than Apache and 
to be at least as fast for static pages (CGI handling is slwer than 
Apache with mod_perl but simiar to Apache without). But when Xitami 
really wants more memory the computer had best be able to give it some 
so running memroy hogging applications like Microsoft Office products is 
to be avoided!

I run a couple of server programs for ftp and mail. I also run the shoutcast
server  occasionally as well. I also have done re-installs, most recently
about a couple of weeks ago and have the same results. however, it seems to
run a little better under win2k  server than 2k pro. the only software I
have installed is the software necessary for me to host my web content.

Okay, I won't quote the other comments from various people. I have installed
Xitami on Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, and XP and interfaced with Microsoft
Access, a mail server, and an FTP server, as well as PHP. I have NEVER, EVER
had Xitami crash on it's own. When I've had crashes, it was due to other
things that I quickly fixed. I also use Norton Disk Doctor, Windoctor, and
Speeddisk. I also use Easy Cleaner and Reg Cleaner to keep the registry
tidy. Last but not least, I use Evidence Eliminator to wipe out all the
extra trash in the Registry. Using all this, prior to even working with
Xitami, prevents any crashes from occurring in the first place.

Okay, maybe it's overkill, but I sincerely believe that the REGISTRY is the
cause of crashes.

OK actually a perl fle in my case but I reckon you could use a batch file.
Look atWin32::Process for how to start stop detect status of a child 
process if you want to do this using perl

I hated 2.5b5 because it kept crashing on me, and wouldn't recover.

This is what I found:

- The configuration files from 2.4d9 are not the same format for 2.5b5
In 2.4d9 you see in the config files:
      Autostart=1

In 2.5b5 you get:
      Autostart = "1"


- Check that all hosts are using the same setting for "Use standard 
I/O?"  I found that some of my virtual hosts were one way, some were 
another.  Find the correct one for your CGI-script, and make them 
consistent.  It was the biggest source of my crashes.


Now that I've discovered those two problems, Xitami has yet to crash on me.

Hope this helps,

Then you must be a supreme fsckwit, mustn't you?  A pointer to the
instructions is included in the trailer to each and every posting:
indeed, you even [over]quoted one in your reply; and the list server
added another.

I've snipped those, but nevertheless the server will add the URL to this
post as well: so why not try following the URL and the instructions to
which it leads?

The headers of each message also contain considerable detail about how to
subscribe and unsubscribe.  Since you're using Pukeout Excess, I presume
that you're blissfully unaware that these headers exist, so I'll quote
one <mailto:xitami-request@lists.xitami.org?subject=unsubscribe> here.

[You must, of course, issue the unsubscribe instructions from the mail
account which has been subscribed to the list.  I doubt that you're

I don't think Micro$oft Outlook Express users will ever learn to send 
text/plain only messages.
I did take a look to the file added, and the best to do is simply write a 
server applet that will get rid of all that is not text/plain in 
multipart/alternative messages.
I'm using a mailserver (Merak) with mailing lists, majordomo functions and 
possibility to call external executables.

Go to Administrative Tools > Services and find Xitami in the list. Then
double-click it to bring up its properties and look for recovery options in the
Recovery tab. You will see that, in case of a crash, you can choose to
automatically restart the Xitami process or even reboot the computer. As a quick
reminder, this is only for Windows 2000 and XP (and maybe NT? I've never used
NT...).

Yes, well as you can see, your mail DID indeed have multipart dividers
within it, and hence (probably) the observed behaviour upon which remarks
have been made.

(I have the luxury of a mailer that, when quoting a message for reply,
includes ALL of the original message's content verbatim; hence I am able
to see all the MIMEry.)

You mail's main headers included:
> Mime-Version: 1.0
> Content-Type: multipart/mixed; x-avg-checked=avg-ok-64F35E9D;
>       boundary="=======521875C3======="

(The above was actually on one line, but MIME Content-Type headers DO
follow the usual RFC-2822 rules on folding and LWSP.) 

[the remainder of your post snipped, which was mostly requoted requotes]

Followed by this:

> --=======521875C3=======

I suspect that AVG is screwing up Eudora.  A *proper* "plain text"
message would merely have had:
> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
> Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
in the main headers; no multipart dividers or suchlike.

Normally this should make no difference.  The second format is that 
used by the WBA when it saves the config files.  But Xitami should 
happily read the config file with or without quotes.  Of course 
_anything_ is possible, and if you're sure this is the cause of the 
problem, we'll jump on it.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami Crashing - Read This - A workaround
Message-ID: <DGEHJCCICENINLMJDFGPEEGECEAA.Rob@BlueMarbleMeds.com>

Hi All,

I have been using the program version (2.5b4) of Xitami for 3 months now on
a Win2k Professional system.  I think it's a really great product, however,
about once every 2 weeks, it crashes.  I have found that the auto-crash
recovery option in Xitami is not reliable.  Auto crash recovery only ever
worked once.  In all other cases, Xitami just crashed and went away for
good.

I have a clean win2k prof system with all up to date OS service releases and
security patches.  I run a simple web site consisting of HTML pages only,
nothing fancy.  Since October, Xitami has crashed about 6 times.  After
reviewing all the debug and log files, I cannot find anything definitive or
consistent that causes the crashes.  The only thing I ever saw in a log file
was an Xitami log entry saying something like "Event - Sending Event to Self
Error" or something like that.  I have seen this a few times.

The most recent crash was today.  After reviewing all logs and debug files
(not just Xitami logs), it happened while no one was at the site.  My Router
logs confirm this.  Xitami just crashed (access violation) while idling.

However, I have found an excellent program called "Watch Dog - O - Matic"
that I use to monitor Xitami and my FTP server software.  If Xitami crashes
then "Watch Dog - O - Matic" detects that and then restarts Xitami.  It
actually worked for me just today.  The Watch Dog program detected that
Xitami encountered a fatal access violation and then restarted Xitami all by
itself.  It worked wonderfully.

I know that the name of the program sounds silly, but, after testing it, the
product really does work.  I tested both the free trial version and the
"Professional" version.  I found that the free trial version didn't work
that well, but the professional version really works well and seems very
reliable.  The professional version cost me 30 dollars U.S.  It seems to
work well, comes with decent documentation, and can be downloaded right
away.

Check this out http://www.prweb.com/releases/2002/7/prweb41555.php  It's an
article and a web link to the site that has this program.

I hope this helps.

No, I don't claim that at all; I was making an observation that they were 
different formats and that it would be most prudent to have configuration 
files Xitami likes.

What I could consistently get Xitami to crash on were my 16-bit CGI-scripts 
when I had "Use Standard I/O?" set the wrong way in the WBA under " CGI 
Properties.  It took me a long time to figure it out because some virtual 
hosts were set one way, while other vhosts were set the other way (it's a 
check-box).  Once I made it consistently the right way, no more "Abnormal 
Application Termination" errors.

Hope this helps,

What OS are you using?

If it is Windows based, try to get the latest PHP from:

http://www.php.net/downloads.php

When you install it, it should be able to find out how to install/write =
the
correct settings on Xitami.

At last xitamis conf should look like this:

in the "filters" page --

file extension----------filter comand or script
.php------------------c:\php\php.exe (the path to your php.exe)

Then you can add more extensions as .php3, phtml, etc.

You just tell xitami to "pass" this extensions to php.exe for =
processing.

One more thing:  many times you want an specific script that you found =
on
the internet to work. This script is not working and you think php =
support
is not working.
But the most of cases is that the script is messing with the paths,
specially when we talk Windows, (Unix Linux people are well aware of =
such
things), or require mysql support for example.

The way to be sure that your php support is wrong configured is to run =
the
test it comes with.

Then start reading this if  is not working yet

here is what I have in my defaults.cfg file

[Filter]
    .php = "c:\\php\\php.exe"
    .phps = "C:\\php\\php.exe -s"
    .phtml = "C:\\php\\php.exe"
    .shtm = "perlssi"
    .shtml = "perlssi"
    .ssi = "perlssi"
then under mimes

[Mime]
Php = "application/php"
Phps = "application/php"
Phtml = "application/php"

also in my autoexec.bat
SET PATH=C:\PHP\;%PATH%

this seems to work for me I am running Version 2.5b5 on XP home
should work from this but check the archives from the list you can get there
at the link from the bottom of all xitami list mail

Subject: [Xitami] Perls and PHPs generating blank pages
Message-ID: <002001c2aa26$6c7ce9c0$fd1e7518@4q1pg>

I've recently installed Xitami as a dev aid for perl / php, and find the
following similar problems with both:

PERL: when using  cgi object refs, a blank page (opening and closing html /
body tags) is returned.
PHPs: calling $_SERVER variables I get another.

simple perls and phps without cgi object or server environment calls seem to
work fine, though I'm sorta new.

I do know that phps generating blanks on my machine, run just fine on my
host's servers.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Did the Xitami list-server suddenly develop a stutter?  Or has Carlos
resent some of his earlier messages?  (I ask the latter because of [a]

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20021230091937.00a224b0@verfaillie4.verfaillie.local>

Hello !

i have a virtual host and wish to point directly to a executable.

That is: instead of having to enter
http://my.server.be/redirect?xxx
(redirect is an executable that points to a cable server (no fixed ip))

i would like something like
http://my.server.be/xxx

That is the content of the specific cfg file for that VH:
[Server]
     Cgi-bin=webpages/verfaillie.be
     Cgi-url=/
     Default2=index.html
     Webpages=webpages/verfaillie.be
(the root dir is the executable directory and contains only one file, 
redirect.exe)

I've tried with aliasses, but it seems not to work (i assume aliasses were 
not meant to transfer to a executable?)


Thanks and a happy new year for all unix and windows and mac and... users

Marc

I believe naming your executable to the default1 page or vv should work.
It works on win32 for me through a cgi-alias but that should not be
imperative.

It works, but i still need a method to get rid of the '?'
adsl (fixed ip): <http://web.verfaillie.com/invasion>
cable: <http://web.verfaillie.be/?invasion>
(same directory, different servers, for some sort of load balancing between 
adsl and cable)

I'm not sure I understand you correctly. Do you wish to redirect a
certain document
to a certain other server/document and again other documents to other
server/document123
or are all the requests regardless of requested document to be
redirected to the same url?

What does the query string parameter "invasion" represent? does the cgi
executable
have to use this parameter to put together the new url it will redirect
the user to?

If latter, you would need to remove the .exe extension from your
executable just as if it
were a directory and pick up the "invasion" from the environment extra
path info.
So you would have to alter the way your executable processes the
parameter. 
Alternatively you could copy your executable as many times as there are 
?invasion -type parameters and rename all these identical executables to
these
specific parameters without the .exe extension - so that they would be
individual 
documents.

It all depends on how you are to use the parameter "invasion".

I hope the above helps.

These are two servers, one connected to a adsl connection with fixed ip, 
the other is a server connected to a cable network without fixed ip.
Both servers are using the same directories for the files to be served (not 
for the config of course).
The adsl connection is always online but slow, the cable is faster but has 
no fixed ip.



>What does the query string parameter "invasion" represent? does the cgi

invasion is the name of a directory.
The redirect executable gets the ip address of the cable server and creates 
a page containing

    STDOUT "<html><head><meta http-equiv='refresh' content='0; url=http://";
    STDOUT ipaddress$;
    STDOUT ":20800/";
    STDOUT ENVIRON$("QUERY_STRING");
    STDOUT "'></head></html>";

The query string is what the executable gets from Xitami and is what follow 
the question mark in a normal request. (The example given above is a 
working one)

It is possible to create one executable for each directory to be served, 
but if there is a different way to do that, i would prefer it.

If you want to avoid cgi-aliases
the user would have to type in the addressbar: 
http://server/executable/parameter
and the ENVIRON$("PATH_INFO") would give you    /parameter   .

You could not avoid an extra directory there because there is no such
thing as a
null "".exe . You definitely need a script name with or without
extension.
User would get a 404 if only  http://server/parameter .

The above doesn't look like Perl but I suppose it would be so:

    STDOUT "<html><head><meta http-equiv='refresh' content='0;
url=http://";
    STDOUT ipaddress$;
    STDOUT ":20800";                   # No slash at end
    STDOUT "/";                        # optional
    STDOUT executable$";               # optional
    STDOUT ENVIRON$("PATH_INFO");      # Has a slash at beg.
    STDOUT "'></head></html>";


Another alternative for creating one executable per directory=parameter
could 
be this:

DomainDefaults.cfg:  ( no cgi-bin alias but script=document alias )

[Cgi-alias]
    Parameter1=C:/Xitami/DomainCgi-bin/executable.exe
    Parameter2=C:/Xitami/DomainCgi-bin/executable.exe
    Parameter3=C:/Xitami/DomainCgi-bin/executable.exe

and script:

    STDOUT "<html><head><meta http-equiv='refresh' content='0;
url=http://";
    STDOUT ipaddress$;
    STDOUT ":20800";                   # No slash at end
    STDOUT ENVIRON$("SCRIPT_NAME");    # Has a slash at beg and will
give
    STDOUT "'></head></html>";         # the alias path - no slash at
end


I do not use this alias example for a parameter via the script name but 
you might perhaps find it workable.

[...] cut some text here

hello

found a fast workaround:

<http://web.verfaillie.com/invasion> normal access via adsl
<http://web.verfaillie.be?invasion> redirection to cable access

Users have to remember to use ? instead of /

<http://web.verfaillie.com/index/invasion> gives me a not_found since 
'index' is a executable and there is no directory or file 'invasion'

I'n already very pleased that i don't need a complete path like
<http://web.verfaillie.be/cgi-bin/index?invasion>


BTW language used is PBCC, sort of basic specific for console (and web) 
applications.

Message-ID: <000d01c2b0b3$c99169e0$0300000a@Nubian2>

I have asked this question a couple of times before .... But here I og
again...


What can I do to get the web server to list the hostnames instead of IP
adresses in the log file??


In my "default.cfg" file I have this:
---------------
[Accesslog]
    Custom = "$\(client) - $\(user) [$\(datetime)] \"$\(request)\"
$\(status-
 \"$\(referer)\" \"$\(agent)\""
    Cycle = "monthly"
    Local = "0"
    Translate = "1"
------------------
And this:
------------------
[Rdns]
    Recurse-lookups = "1"
    Debug = "1"
    Primary-server = "DNS server1"
    Secondary-server = "DNS server2"
------------------
(DNS server1 and 2 are replaced by real servers)

In my .cfg file for the spesific site i have this:
------------------
[Accesslog]
    Filename = "sitename.log"
    Local = "0"
    Translate = "1"

[Rdns]
    Recurse-lookups = "1"
-------------------


But I still don't get hostnames in the log file.

I run version 2.5b5 as a windows service on a w2K proffesional platform.

Does anyone else have this problem ???? And does anyoune know how to solve
it ?

Yours

LRWP apps are not like most other CGI types--they are simply TCP/IP programs
connecting to a certain Xitami port. And as such, developping LRWPs should be
pretty much platform-independent. If you can use the socket components in
Delphi, then I think you can develop LRWPs. Read through the LRWP section of the
Xitami manual, if you haven't already. That will give you the best answer IMO.

Note that your message's size is around 266 bytes instead 4 kilobytes when the

Under the logging section of the main configuration file there is an option:
"Translate IP address" - I would assume that is a DNS lookup on the IP
address.  If that is not enough then you could also toy with the "Log File
Format" - it gives you different options (maybe the extended one) that might
do what you are looking for.  And 3rd, the "log file format string" might
allow you to put a DNS/Hostname variable that writes the DNS name to the log
file.

And if all that doesn't work, then you can always write a script that parses
the more recent log file (not the current though because the current log
file is still open and controlled by xitami) and performs a DNS nslookup/dig
on the IP address and rewrites that data back to the log file.

good luck.

Finally, one should think VERY carefully about recording domain names
INSTEAD of IP addresses in a log file, because at least an IP address is
traceable, whereas a rogue client might also have faked reverse DNS set
up to camouflage the source and send you off on a wild goose chase.

In short, ALWAYS record the IP address, and also, if you wish, the domain
name into which rDNS translates this.  (However, of course, any decent
log analysis program would be able to perform that rDNS operation at any
later time: after all, this is not rocket science, and I recall doing
this on FTP servers that I was administering back in the 1980s, long
before TimB-L had invented the web.)
