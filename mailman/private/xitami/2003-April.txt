When running Xitami Internet Explorer is not automatically refreshing the default.html 
even though we have IE set to automatically refresh the page.

Is there something in the web server that dictates this action?

Check your server logs for HTTP '304' responses when you request the
'default.html' page.  That response indicates to the browser that the page
in its cache is current and to use the cached copy instead of downloading
the page from the server.  This cuts down on bandwidth usage and increases
the overall speed of retrieving the webpage, but does introduce fun
problems for developers to deal with.

Hope this helps!

Nothing to do with browser. It only displays information received from server.

Yep, in [Server] section parameter variable cache-defaults

I am also having this problem!! Xitami used to be as stable as a rock. I
believe I used to run 2.4d5. I upgraded to the newest beta, had crashing
problems. Un-installed that, and installed 2.4d9, and still have crashing
problems.
I am running a sever-only machine with Win2k and all the latest patches,
behind a ZoneAlarm Pro firewall with WWW, FTP and DNS ports open.
Xitami runs for anywhere between 2 hours, and 4 days before crashing. I have
not been able to find anything consistent in debug logs.
It simply dies, while leaving the tray icon, which of course disappears as
soon as you move your mouse over it.
Lately, it has been crashing with a C++ runtime error message window.

So should I fall back to 2.4d5 and forgo the DOS patch? Is it actually that
2.4d9 is unstable? Or did the Beta install leave behind something?

Thanks for any insights you can give to this costly problem.

Tom

Hi,

If you're on WinNT or Win2k just use the NT service version! It is much more
stable. And there no need for logging on as a user in order to run your
webserver. An you can choose to reboot your computer when the server service
crashes, or use a script that boots it regularly, say once a month, and...
and... it works much better trust me.

Well, there's not going to be a tray icon anymore. But if you want to manage
your computer remotely, through a SSH link what is the use of a tray icon
anyway.

Good luck.

Are you running as a service ?
On Win 98, I get crashes every so often.
But not on NT 4 sp6a as a service. There, it goes months.

I've had decent stability with the console version under win2k.  I 
like the tray icon of the win32 version.  But it was not as stable for 
me.

Sounds great! Can I still have access to the control panel for settings? Or
do I need to edit the config files directly?

Costly?  What exactly are you doing that makes Xitami crashes costly?

I run Xitami v2.4d9 NT Service on WinXP and have no problems.  Shutting
down the server and restarting is a pain.  If you want a Xitami NT Service
monitor (something similar to ProtoNova v1.31's NT Service Monitor
program), I can whip up a quickie program for everyone to use.  I also run
ProtoNova on port 82 as an NT Service.  In my experience, most stuff is
more stable when implemented as an NT service for some reason or other
(perhaps the developers are more cautious about coding since NT services
can be a pain to debug).

Also, I notice you have an FTP server.  It is a well-known fact that
Xitami's FTP server is really buggy.  When I had the Xitami FTP server
enabled, the server crashed even as a NT service on a weekly basis.  Most
people here will tell you that you are better off with a real FTP server
unless you have a really low-load Xitami server (particularly in the FTP
arena).  Since I turned it off, I haven't had any problems.

Hope this helps!

In your server configuration, turn off the 'cache-defaults' option by
setting it to '0' instead of '1'.  Restart the web server.  Reload the
page.  Check your logs and see if it refreshed properly according to the
server.

Hope this helps!

My personal experience:

I am running Xitami v2.5b4 (Win32) on a dedicated hand-me-down P166 running
Win98SE (fully patched) in 80mb.  Zone Alarm (free version) assists.  FTP
and HTTP services enabled on a non-standard port-base.  The LWRP services
also runs.  I haven't quite got the virtual domain thing going yet, but
fooling around got me a basehost.cfg file.

In this configuration, the computer has been up for 15 straight days and
Xitami has been running for 12 days.  Except for an occassional browser
check of a ZA alert, the machine sits in the corner and is accessed from
other computers on the internal network (in NetBEUI and TCP/IP).

Admittedly, this is a low use private server accessed by invitation only.  I
receive anywhere from 0 to 6 individual hits per day (although AOL IPs can
be confusing).  Most of the rest of the hits are my internal web page tests.

I don't run the DOS console because it leaves a DOS box up and the Win32
version hasn't been a real problem.  The only freeze-up was 3 weeks ago when
I was getting probed in port 80.  The log showed a huge request string just
before things went dark.  Moving the base-port seems to have solved
everything.  However, not running on port 80 creates an interesting set of
problems.

>From an outside view point, it looks like a Windows support file may have
gotten corrupted and the problem may not be in Xitami directly.  And lets
not forget a good cleaning of the box.  I had one motherboard that if I
didn't keep the processor heatsink fins and fan cleaned out, would overheat
and start generating exception errors (usually around 58-60 degrees (C)).
That was different.

Much luck,
Charles

No good on the cache-defaults option. I still don't get a refresh on default.html until I 
hit the refresh button.

Where else can I look?

Subject: [Xitami] Virtual Hosts Security Configuration Question
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20030402085701.025a00a0@mailserver.ewu.edu>

Still fighting the VHosts problem.
I have a number of VHs, of the general form :MyClassTeam01.ewu.edu
I have created separate .aut and .cfg files for each VH.

APPROACH 1
In the defaults.cfg file, I say this:
[Virtual-hosts]
MyClassTeam01.ewu.edu = "team01.cfg"

In team01.cfg, I say this:
[Security]
     Filename = "team01.aut"

in team01.aut, I say:
[/Setup]
     team01="password"

HOWEVER,
If you log in to MyClassTeam01.ewu.edu, Xitami ignores the security 
settings and just lets you in.

APPROACH 2
If, in defaults.cfg I say:
[Virtual-hosts]
MyClassTeam01.ewu.edu = "defaults.cfg"

[Security]
     Filename = "defaults.aut"

then in defaults.aut
[Team01]
     Team01= "password"

it works.

The trouble is, approach 1 is preferred because it puts user logs where the 
student teams can get to them.

Obviously a configuration problem.  I tried dropping the [Security] entry 
in defaults.cfg, but that didn't help.
Any idea how I can get approach 1 to work?

What exactly does your default.html file look like?  Perhaps that will shed
some light on the problem.

Hope this helps!

I didn't make the icons, but Jeff Painter's site is down and I had them
locally, so I decided to share :)

During a recent discussion about Xitami crashing when run from the GUI and
not the NT Service, I decided it was time to put together a Xitami NT
Service Monitor/Controller program for NT Service users.  The resulting
program, XiMon, is now available for download at:

http://www.shininglightpro.com/search.php?searchname=XiMon

It is a particularly useful tool for developers who constantly change the
server configuration and don't want to keep an extra window open to
shutdown and restart the Xitami Web Server.

Hope this helps!

  My isp recently changed servers or something, which caused the static ip

I pinged www.sorcep.com and DNS reports back 216.204.150.251

It's possible your DNS has not propogated yet.  Depending on your server the time 
to live sets how fast the updates happen.  If you are running your own DNS if you 
forget to change your serial nothing will update.

I would also iterate that DNS propagation can easily take 48 hours from time
of change. Depending on your Time To Live, it make be a week even. Also
note, that some places on the net will get your new DNS record before
others.

Just a thought...

If you are directly accessing your web site from an internal workstation (ie
another computer on your internal network), all you log is the IP of the
workstation.

If you are accessing your web site internally via your domain name or the
WAN IP address that is mapped (Linksys calls it DMZ) to your server, all
you'll get is your routers gateway IP.  Not sure why.

To get a visitor's IP loggged, you need to go outside.  A dialup connection
works well.  A friends house is just as good.  There's always the library.
Does make testing cumbersome.

Much luck,
Charles

I use a hub and a router.

                     |
                 Server
   
The gateway on my server points to the ISP
The gateway on the interal PC's points to the Router.
Even though the machines are in the same building, they 
are on completely different networks.

Therefore, I always see the router ip when accessing the server 
from internal PC's.

Hmmm...

Our only differerence is:
        ISP --- Router --- Hub --- everybody else
                                     |
                                 Server

Router gateway = ISP
Server gateway = Router
I only have 1 assigned IP

Where does the router point to?  I see a possible conflict between your
router and the server:  unless you have multiple assigned IPs, they're both
using the same one IP, which may be possible if you are MAC cloning the
server's network card.

If using a single IP, then the server is receiving it's traffic thru NAT
services performed by the router, making the topology difference moot.

As an afterthough, this may not help.  Does DSL make you use the "hosts"
file?  Or is what you refer to "hosts" is the basehost.cfg file that is part
of Virtual domaining?

Wondering,
Charles

Here is a thought. The log file works with Omni httpd, however Omni is a
little slower with virtual hosts running and it only has one log file. I'm
using forwarding not DMZ.

Hmmm...

Our only differerence is:
        ISP --- Router --- Hub --- everybody else
                                     |
                                 Server

Router gateway = ISP
Server gateway = Router
I only have 1 assigned IP

Where does the router point to?  I see a possible conflict between your
router and the server:  unless you have multiple assigned IPs, they're both
using the same one IP, which may be possible if you are MAC cloning the
server's network card.

If using a single IP, then the server is receiving it's traffic thru NAT
services performed by the router, making the topology difference moot.

As an afterthough, this may not help.  Does DSL make you use the "hosts"
file?  Or is what you refer to "hosts" is the basehost.cfg file that is part
of Virtual domaining?

Wondering,
Charles

Message-ID: <3E8DCD52.4030107@aon.at>

Hi!

I recently found Xitami on the web and I'm trying to define some aliases 
for PHP.

My problem is: it simply does not work.

I use following versions:
Xitami: v2.5b5
OS: Win XP Pro
PHP: 4.3.1

If I put following file in the webpages/php directory everthing works 
fine with <http://localhost/php/phpinfo.php>:
<?php phpinfo() ?>

But when I define aliases (and restarted the server):
web    n:\ablage\web\php
php1   C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\ov\Eigene Dateien\php

I receive the following error with <http://localhost/web/phpinfo.php>:
The URL you asked for does not exist on this website

This directory is on a Samba network drive and is accessable. I also 
tested the latest stable version, but no diffrence.

Even if the path is on the same drive as the webpages directory I 
receive the same message with <http://localhost/php1/phpinfo.php>.

What am I doing wrong?

Regards,
Oliver

Well, it's not your fault. This is a known problem: filters won't work 
in aliased directories. If you use VirtualHosts instead everything works 
fine. Another way is to move your webpages directory.

Hi all,

I'm running Xitami 2.5b5 on Win2k Pro, Duron 600MHz, 256+128MB RAM, 100Mbit 
Ethernet card.

Sitting on another machine (Win XP Pro, Athlon 1.2G, 256MB RAM, 100Mbit 
Ethernet card) at our building 100Mbit intranet and accessing my Xitami ftp 
server I get these results:

download 200MB file from server:
* speed about 250-300 kBytes per second,
* server CPU usage below 10%, by Xitami aprox. 2-4%

upload the same file to server:
* speed about 7.5-8 MBytes per second,
* server CPU usage about 99%, by Xitami aprox. 95%

Could someone explain or give an idea to me, why there is so big diference 
between download and upload speed?

Thank you for your time.

M. Scholze jr.

Hey folks!
Recently I changed to the service version of Xitami 2.4d9. I had been using
the app version, and was having stability problems. So far (at least), the
service version seems stable. But here's a strange catch:
Upon system startup, the Xitami service loads, but does not accept incoming
connection attempts. If I restart the service, everything is AOK.

 System specs:
P2-350
Win2k with all latest patches
Static IP business DSL
DNS server
Mercury/32 mail server
ZoneAlarm Pro

So here's my guess: Xitami service is loading before ZoneAlarm. When
ZoneAlarm starts, it disrupts the port monitoring by Xitami.

So... If this is true, does anybody have an idea on how to fix it?

Thanks again!
Tom

Xitami shouldn't be consuming that much CPU time.  Apparently Xitami is
lacking some sort of throttle mechanism for uploads (seems to be doing fine
on downloads).  The CPU usage for any webserver should be 10% at most to be
able to handle periodic spikes up to 50%.  Anything over 50% is asking for
trouble on a high-speed connection like yours.  If you don't want to mess
with modifying code, you could throttle the network card back to 10Mb
instead of the 100Mb you are currently running at (which should effectively
slow things down).

Hope this helps!

Yup.  That happens.  There's a way to fix it, but it requires writing code
(as far as I know).

Delay start Xitami by making it a dependency of ZoneAlarm in the Services
Control Panel.  To do this, you need to write program that calls
OpenServiceManager(), OpenService(), ChangeServiceConfig(), and
CloseServiceHandle().  I don't have time at the moment to do this, but
maybe someone else here will write a quick program that does that for you.
If you want to wait a week and e-mail me to remind me about this (if no
one's done this yet), I'll write it.

Hope this helps!

Thank you.

CPU load is the secondary problem, it doesn't matter. Xitami manages among 
connections well and the server (machine) is dedicated mainly for http and 
ftp services.

My problem is slow speed for downloading, which I would like increase, not 
high speed for upload. And I have no idea how to do it :-/ Throttling is off.

Can't you just modify the registry entry for the Xitami service by 
adding the value "DependOnService", which is to be set to whatever the 
name of the ZoneAlarm service is?
The only trouble I see in this approach is that the value type is 
REG_MULTI_SZ, which, I believe, is impossible to create through 
Regedit. But it shouldn't be much of a problem with editing an 
exported registry key, which is actually a text file.

A little trimming/quoting goes a long way in getting you message read.
Especially if you reply at the bottom instead of the top of a message.

hello,
I use xitami on a freebsd system
I can't get directory listing with xitami not running as root. 
With another uid (www)  it gives "error 403"
The rights are ok: user www can "ls" and "cd" the directory.
Any idea?

That's dangerous and probably not going to work across multiple versions of
NT.  Using the service manager is much safer.

Errm, it's a stupid question but, are you on an ADSL connection?  If so,
then it's likely that its assymetry is such that traffic TO your machine
(which in other circumstances would be you downloading from the rest of
the Internet, but in this instance is data being uploaded to your server)
will have twice the bandwidth of your uplink (which is this instance will
be carrying the traffic downloaded from your FTP server).

You could talk to your ISP; AIUI, it's possible to have an ADSL line's
assymetry reconfigured "the other way round".

Can anyone tell me what the latest *production* version of Xitami is?

On http://www.xitami.com/download.htm, the latest production version is 2.4d9.

On http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index2.htm#download (I got to this page
from SecurityFocus, but apparently there's no other way to go there), both the
latest production and beta versions are 2.5b5.

I'm confused. Is this a case of web page update lack on iMatix's side?

If I'm not mistaken the 'b' in that version implies a Beta version not

Installed Xitami on a Win98SE box, configured it for PHP.
Tested the PHP and seems to function properly, however one of the

try turning registered globle variables on in your php.ini file see if that
helps
what is the name of the script, do you have a link to it so we can check the
code? although because you have no problems running php I would think it is
because of a setting in the php.ini file

I've looked at some of the list archives, but I cannot find what I need.
Installed Xitami on a Win98SE box, configured it for PHP.
Tested the PHP and seems to function properly, however one of the
scripts we wish to use uses a get method variable/value combination
in the URL.  This variable is causing a variable not recognized error when
we load the page, ie...//ip_address/page.php?setcookie=password.
Any help would be appreciated.

The script is one of the chat scripts out on the web.
I tried this same script on an Omni box awhile ago and it worked.
That box has php4.2 I believe, which should mean that it does not
require globals on. I'll try it when I get to work this morning anyway.
Cannot allow a link, however, as it is on a state agency site, behind a
firewall.

Thank you. The concept looks good, but how do I not see how to specificy
this delayer launch instead Xitami as a service?

Thanks!

Your links are NOT really helpful to understand what script and what source
code YOU are using!

These days I was working around with SSI. The problem that I have is that
Xitami cannot show included files in sub directories. Xitami shows ALL files
as e.g. Dreamweaver but that is not intended n testing!

Betreff: [Xitami] SSI

I'm having trouble getting my Server-Side Includes working, and I'm
hoping that someone here can help.  I'm using Matt Wright's Random Text
script, and it works perfectly when I just run the script
(http://www.wreckedandabandoned.com/cgi-bin/rand_text/rand_text.pl), but
when I try to include it in a test page
(http://www.wreckedandabandoned.com/cgi-bin/rand_text/test.shtml)
there's no output from the script.  I'm sure I've just overlooked
something, but I'm stumped.  I would appreciate any help.  Thanks.

Betreff: [Xitami] CONFIGURING SEVERAL SITES

I have 3 sites each with its index.htm page, named index, index1, index2
each located in different directories.
 I want to configure Xitami so that there could be access to any of those
index pages by typing the corresponding address according to the index.
Now Xitami is configured at installation to read index pages from its
webpages folder. How do I configure it to read from those 3 or more
directories, what is the full address to type in browser to get to any of
thos pages indistinctly ?
Do I have to use aliases ? If so, how do I configure them ?
Thanks
Rolito

> Will Xitami run on XP ?

Yes. Mostly it does not care what flavor of Windows it runs under.

> Which instal version should I use ?

On NT/XP, if you plan to have Xitami running all the time (as for a
webserver), use the NT Service version. It is MUCH more stable (over
long periods of time) than the GUI version.

For Win9x, and for occasional use (like for page/script testing) in
NT/XP, the non-service version is fine, and gives you the red/green
light in taskbar so you know when your script is stuck.

> I note that the 'hosts' file on XP appears twice on XP

 C:\WINDOWS\I386\HOSTS        (there is also an encoded file LMHOST.SA_)
 C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts    (there is also a file imhosts.sam)

The "I386" folder is installation files, equivalent to the NT4
CD-ROM. (In NT4 days I often copied the CD:\I386 folder to the hard
drive so I didn't have to keep the CD nearby.) Windows won't look
there except when installing.

C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts is THE hosts file. Hack this
file to over-ride DNS and point a public website to your own
machine.

LMHOSTS[.SAM] is used for Windows Networking. In theory it has the
IP numbers of your favorite Windows-Networked machines. However I
have seen Windows (or IE?) use LMHOSTS for InterNet (website)
lookups, even if it has the .SAM (sample) extension. I ignore it.

of the time.  I've never set anything different, not on purpose anyway.  :)

Subject: [Xitami] nocc and/or php problem
Message-ID: <000001c30eca$88abd0d0$5f01a8c0@MAINCOMPUTER>

I'm trying to configure NOCC as a webmail server.  The problem that I'm
having is that NOCC doesn't seem to be able to share variables among its
various parts.  I.e., it can't 'remember' the password from the index.php
script to the action.php script:

Notice: Undefined variable: passwd in
C:\Xitami\webpages\pubhome\nocc\action.php on line 24
  
Another symptom is that I'm getting this notice when I load index.php:
Notice: Undefined variable: HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE in
C:\Xitami\webpages\pubhome\nocc\check_lang.php on line 17

However, 
if I let PHP register variables globally, it works fairly well.
register_globals = On    in php.ini

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Dennis

Hi,

 

Is it possible to have multiple virtual sites on different ports when
running as a service under XP Pro? The FAQ suggests this is done by running
multiple instances of Xitami from different directories, each with its own
default.cfg file. I'm unclear on how you would install multiple services.

 

Thanks,

Ric

Hello,

I also had this message that came out of the blue

Assertion Failed!

  Module c:\work\imatix\release\xitami-24\src\smt\smtlib.c, line 1309


I tried to see if someone was trying to log to the 
server, but the was no entry for the time of the crash.

(on Win2K)

Sometimes, I find my machine had rebooted during the 
night. This has probably nothing to do with Xitami, 
but I have no idea either why that happens. 

regards
Guido

Meanwhile I get better - or let's say ANY - error message through the cgi

HTTP_REFERER]. The same error I got by testssi.ssi.
First I supposed Zonealarm Pro 3 to block and shut down. No change. Next I
tried to skip this error by unchecking  'Pass HTTP fields' in 'CGI'
administration. The result was the script doesn't recognise HTTP_USER_AGENT,
too.
Who can help?
