Subject: [Xitami] SpeedStream 2614?
Message-ID: <200211012031.46536.bpaddock@csonline.net>

I have a SpeedStream 2614 4-port router.

I have been trying to get Xitima setup on my Linux box.

On the LAN side I can see Xitima fine.

However from the WAN side of the router I can't get any kind of respons.

If I go to http://grc.com and run their "probe my ports" and I have Xitima 
running it says "port 80 is open".

If Xitima is not running I get "port 80 is closed".

Xitima is running as port 6080 on the LAN and the router is translating the 80 
to the 6080.

Ideas?

Try coming in from the WAN on anything but Port 80, try *.*.*.*:90 to 6080.
I had a similar issue with my Linksys router

I tried port 1234 on the WAN side, same results.  :-(

Tried these:

LAN    WAN

80        80   [Should that work?]
6080    80
80       1234
6080   1234

Since I switched from ISDN to DSL I also can no longer  "loopback" to my
server with WAN addressing. Have someone from the WAN side try it.

Looks like your right, this answer from support just came in.
You would think they might mention this in the docs some place.
I wasted a lot of time thinking I had things set up wrong. :-(

RE: SpeedStream 2614 blocking web server?

From: 
SpeedStream Support Mailbox <Support@Speedstream.com>

 Bob,
    All fo the information of hits to the firewall from the WAN side should
be located in the "Security Log" on the status page of the router's web
interface.

[Nothing but LAN info is in that log?  I asked them about that in my respons.]

    As far as accessing the web server from the WAN side, there are several
different variable that could lead to an inability to connect through the
router.

   1.  Make sure that you are trying to access the WEB server from a
computer that is NOT within the LAN.  The Small Office / Home Office Routers
do not have the capability of accessing it's own public IP address from a
client within the Local area network.
[Why?]

   2.  Also,  make sure that you are attempting to access the Web server
using the WAN, or Public IP address (Ip address assigned by your ISP).
This should grant you access to your web server.
[I was.]

Thank you for your inquiry!

Hi Bob,

I discovered what you did about my own router. Accessible from the LAN side
but not the WAN. However, I can check from a different dial-up account and
it's there. There is no loopback capabilities with home routers. Of course,
we could alway get an expensive Cisco router that would work, but I use a
less expensive way to to check to the server.

I use the host file. In it, I define all the servers like this:

192.168.1.2  www.domain1.com
192.168.1.2  www.domain2.com

It works for me.

Hey all, I am still having an occasional lock up on Xitami (running on a =
AMD K6-2 400MHz, 256 megs of RAM, Win2K with SP3). What I am wondering =
is:

#1. Is there a way to use something like Task Scheduler or a 3rd party =
program to recover from a failure and restart Xitami?

#2. Same as above, but how about just a re-boot of the system?

I am sure someone has to be doing something like this.

I ask because I am going to be working out of town quite a bit between =
now and the end of the year and will not be home enough to just manually =
recover from something like this.

Thanks for any help you folks can provide!

Mike

If you have access to a computer, use WinVNC and access your desktop
remotely. If Xitami conks out you can easily re-start it.

Yeah, I thought of that, but it is not really an option. If I am out of town
working, then it could be hours and hours before I have the opportunity to
check it. If, however, there is a utility I can run that would re-start
Xitami if it has crashed and then check every so often, that is a much
better solution.

Thanks for the assist though!

Works GREAT! Will even reboot any machine across a network. Has different

John:

I had a look at it. It would appear that for the server monitoring, you have
to put the IP Sentry program on the server that you want to monitor?

Do you mean having to install the software onto the same machine running the
server? If that is your question, then no. I have ipsentry installed an a
separate machine on the network. That is the beauty, such as if the server
machine locks up, crashes or whatever, the live machine running ipsentry
detects that and takes appropriate action. Now all you have to hope is that
the machine running ipsenrty doesn't crash;-)

My Xitami installs are very reliable.
I use scheduling software for checking my email server 
and also for scanning new files coming into public folders.
I can check to see if things are working and you can 
assign the actions.

Recover silently from crashes?

It would depend upon what the recover silently is supposed to do. It still
brings up a dialog box that requires hitting the enter key and the
application certainly does not restart itself.

I'd have to say .. sometimes it's the OS.

How old is the OS install ?
Did the OS come from the factory or did you do it? 
If from the factory, they use 'images' and sometimes this is
an issue.

Before you blow off Xitami, consider a format and OS reinstall.
Don't forget the format.

When I re-formatted and reinstalled NT4, things just seemed a
whole lot better. You are on XP ? It's still a MS product and 
they sometimes are finickey.

My 2cent.

Mike,

I've been running the 2.4 versions (9x) for years. In fact, I'm using 2.4d9
on a Win98 machine with 64 megs of RAM.

I've never had a server crash, don't even know what it looks like. You're
running Win2000, which is basically a newer NT. Version 2.4d9 should still
run on it without crashes. If your OS was preinstalled, especially if on a
Compaq computer, I would say that's the culprit and not Xitami.

I know it's not what you want to hear, because it's a lot of work to do a
complete reinstall. I've done it myself many times on different machines and
I dread it each time, because I know I'll lose some piece of software or
data that I forgot about before the reinstall.

Just my 82 cents (inflation!).

Richard

Nope, not a pre-install and not a Compaq. I installed myself and when this
was going on earlier I already wiped everything and started over. It is
Win2K with SP3 (having the same problems with SP2) on an AMD K6-2 400MHz
with 256 megs of RAM.

I am pretty much at my wits end here.

There are two other things that can cause errors:

1) The board getting hot.
2) Dirty RAM chips.

I had an old Packard Smell years ago that seems to get errors for no
apparent reason. While I was examining the running system with covers in
place, it ran like a champ. As soon as I put the covers back on, it started
producing random errors in different applicatons.

One thing that happened recently...I was running a program (it may have been
Norton something) and it said I had an error in RAM....and I tested several
times with the same result.  I opened my machine, pulled out the RAM chips,
used a pencil erasor on the edge connectors and reseated them. The "error"
went away.

I'm not saying either of these is your problem. But it's possible. That it's
an AMD and that it's 400MHz is not an issue. I mentioned earlier running on
a machine with 64 megs. It also happens to be AMD 200 mmx (an old IBM
Aptiva). I also tested the same version of Xitami on my newer XP machine
(1.4GHz and 512 mb RAM) in Win98 compatibility mode and it runs like a champ
on it. Speaking of compatiblity mode....does Win2000 have one. If it does,
use it.

Richard:

Well, I found what looks to be a nice memory tester at
http://www.simtester.com and ran it. Seems to be pretty indepth on the tests
that it does...Walk Data, Walk Address, MATS+, March B, March C-,
Checkerboard, Burst and Moving Inversion. All of that does not mean a damn
thing to me, but it took about 20 minutes to complete and it passed all
tests.

I recently purchased a "blower" for this PC and have yet to install it. It
installs like a card and is supposed to move about 12 cfm of air. I have a
decent fan in the front of the machine. Guess I will get that installed
tomorrow and see if it makes any difference at all.

What bothers me though is that Xitami registers that an error has taken
place and that the program is shutting down. But, like I said...when you
check the crash log and error log there is nothing there. So, I am at a bit
of a loss in figuring out what the hell the deal is. And this seems to be
the only thing that crashes. Nothing else gets effected at all. Very
strange...

Thanks!

Well, Mike, I don't know if this will help you, but we were having (and, 
from time to time, still do...) this same problem.  We found that 
increasing the RAM from 128Mb to 512Mb decreased the drop-off by 
75%.  I understand that this really doesn't conincide with any of the 
other suggestions anyone has offered, but, when it seems that many of 
us are having this problem, and all the community can do is suggest 
"wives tales and home remedies".... you try what gets the job done, eh?

I think the memory helped us, since this one box runs the web, ftp, mail, 
and one of the video servers.  Even at 512Mb, this box is taxed!  
Nonetheless, since there have been so many of us who have 
experienced this type of crashing, it would be interesting to at least 
discover what is causing the problem.  Then, we can figure out a 
solution.  Process.

Brad Smith.

Brad:

Thanks for the response. I may be a little "SOL" as I cannot add memory over
256 megs on this older system that I am running on. I am running some other
tasks on the box, but they are very low resource users as my network is a
small home network. The most busy application is Xitami and the web forum I
run that utilizes MySQL and PHP. I know that this is free and now basically
unsupported software, but is there not a listing of error messages somewhere
to refer back to? Can't the developers put something out to let us try and
figure out what these errors actually mean?

Very frustrating!

Thanks!

Hi folks,

I just thought I would add my 2 cents worth to this as I have exactly the
same problem and have basically had it for so long I don't remember when it
started.

My machine has undergone many changes and is now an amd 1200 with 256 megs
ram.

I note that crashes only seem to happen when the machine has been running
for long periods without reboot which might indicate that it is running out
of ram or failing to release it.

I also note that 9 times out of 10 there is no error log but in the actual
server log there is always crap sometimes just blank space and other times
it looks like the mail server has dumped it contents into the web server
log.

Because the problem didn't go away when I updated from 128 megs ram to 265 I
doubt it is ram and suspect there is something wrong with the logging system
and the error message just quoted seems to point to the same thing.

Is anyone else seeing crap in their logs when it crashes ?

Have you tried any sort of memory manager to see if that helps any at all?
Something like Cacheman? I hear it is very good.

Hi Mike,

I have been a member here for some years now and this has been discussed
many times.

I am so used to it that it doesn't bother me but I do read the posts just in
case someone has a fix.

If it was a memory problem it would have gone away some time during my
upgrades and other programs would be effected by the memory problem unless
it is something in the web server causing the memory problem.

I have not tried anything to fix it and I honestly don't expect anything to
fix it.

One thing I do notice is that like me most of the people having problems are
amd users so maybe its an amd thing ...anyone out there seeing this on non
amd machines ?

My last 3 upgrades have been amd 500, 800 and now 1200 and thinking back on
it, I didn't have this before the 500 upgrade ( I don't think).

I get the same thing off and on.  Stuff like that seems to happen more often
when I am using Kazaa on the same machine.

I had another crash this morning and this time it was a little different.
The Xitami tray icon was yellow as if someone was connected, but it was

I don't think it is just an AMD issue. The first CPU I had in the box was an
Intel P-233. I had the same problems with that CPU that I do now. The AMD
that is in there is the CPU upgrade that comes from Evergreen Technologies.
Works like a champ and gives a great boost to the box. Just cannot get
Xitami to run consistantly.

Like I said, there is no error list? And there is no one from Xitami on this
list? I can understand if they are not going to continue to develop the free
program...but you would think they would at least address the issue if that
many folks have been having the issue for that long.

Unfortunatly I believe that the problem with Xitami on Windows isn't an
Xitami problem it's a Windows problem. I have been a long time Win OS user,
supporter, and technician and find this is more a Windows issue than
anything else. Especially if you have other apps that run on the same PC.
Windows is less forgiving for a lot of issues like Hardware, and badly
written software. Not saying that Xitami is badly written. I have been using
Xitami for a while and yes I crash at times too, but it's only while I'm
doing other things on the PC so I'm not sure it's really Xitami's fault. I'm
running Xitami, a mail server, a dns server, a web cam, monitor stocks, fax
software, cd burner, scanner, Norton AV,  Norton System Doctor and keep my
Outlook 2000 open all day (just to mention a few) all on the same system. I
probably have to reboot at least once a week. Is this an Xitami problem? NO!
most of the time either my DNS server forgets to server or some other apps
stops responding. I would be looking at a Windows or PC issue not Xitami.

You may be right on this. I had many problems
long ago with ms-dos and clipper and Cobol programs.
I had errors on AMD and Cyrix but never had on Intel.
Since that time i only use Intel. The most powerful processor
at that time was the Pentium75 or something so you see it was
just after the Dinossaurs :)

Oh come on now...my first PC was an 8086 with an RGB monitor, a 5mg HDD and
a whopping 256K of memory. After loading Turbo Pascal, Wordstar and a couple
of games, I could not figure out what I was going to do with all of that
disk space. Now the box I am on has a total of 200 gig! And then their is my
Apple IIe....

I really don't think it is an AMD issue. Like I said, I had the exact same
problem with an Intel CPU in there.

I have Ver2.4d9 running as a service on a Win2k SP3 Pentium II 500 and never
had any problems with it.
So i guess it's not a Windows 2K or SP3 Issue.

Same here.  I have had Xitami 4.10 running on AMD and Intel (P4-
1.7Ghz), both running Win2K Pro.  Whoever said that the probabability 
is a fault of Windows is looking more and more accurate.  On the other 
hand, knowing that there are several other really dependable web 
servers for Windows that don't experience this problem, Imatix should
(would one not think?) investigate what part of the code is causing this 
crash in Windows, no?  Am I over-simplifying the obvious?

Not all loads of Windows have problems, I am running Win2kpro and update the
SP and Security often. I am also on an AMD 850 however my wife runs a WinXP
on a Celeron. I use NTFS and she runs FAT. She seems to have more problems
with lockups that I do. One of microsoft problems is the rush to publish and
live debugging. It is more economical to rush the product out, then debug it
in the field, hence Service Packs. Win2kpro is based on NT and as we all
know NT is much more stable than Win95/98/ME. And NTFS is more stable than
FAT. I think (and it just my opionion) that Microsoft has spent much more
time on NT/Win2kPro than any other because it is the systems used by the big
corporations. I don't really want to put the blame on anyone but it just
might be a combination of the products that you are using from Xitami all
the way down to the chipset of the motherboard. Believe it or not, Memory
can check good using a memory tester but if it's mis-matched will cause
problems. Hence a problem we had at Bellsouth and Compaq PC's. One group
added memory modules from a different manufacture to all the PC's, all the
memory was good but yet it caused the BSOD...often. After we put matched the
memory the problems went away.

Sorry for the long post

Use the NT Service version, not the other that runs on Win9x/NT.

Turn off FTP.

Can you switch to the service without screwing anything up or having to

Yes, at about the same rate: once or twice a year.

My current main server is AMD K6/2 350 and runs very solid in 256M
of RAM. My previous box was Intel P-133 and 32Meg and also ran
solid. I have run Xitami on a 386SX-16 with 4Megs... Win3.11's TCP
stack sucked but Xitami never gave any trouble even on a machine too
lame to surf its own pages.

Don't use any Win9x unless you really know Win9x well. Use one of
the NTs (or of course OS/2 or Unix if you wish).

On NT, NTFS is marginally more stable than FAT.

I agree about not running user-programs on a webserver. Often this
works fine, but sometimes not.

Do not expect the tray-icon version of Xitami to stay up. It does
for some people, but many folks report that it crashes/locks for
them. USE THE NT SERVICE version for any long-running server. I do
use the tray-icon jobbie for quick-checking stuff on my home
machine, but not for any server I am going to walk away from.

> Can you switch to the service without screwing anything up

I have no idea; never did that. I believe all the CFG files are
identical so it "should" work. But copy your CFG files to a safe
place first. The Service Installer does not always work; drop to a
command line and run the exe manually to see how to Install directly.

> I recently purchased a "blower" ... supposed to move about 12 cfm
> of air.

If the machine is truly over-heating, 12CFM is like being in the
desert and fanning yourself with a matchbook. Anything less than
45-60CFM in a case is wishful thinking.

First find out if the machine IS hot. Set it up exactly as it
normally runs (covers on(*), jammed in a corner, cat laying against the
case vents, whatever) and let it run all morning. Shut-down, rip the
cover off. Keep one hand on the metal case and use the other to
carefully feel around. For a long-running server, I like everything
so un-hot that I could keep my hand on it forever without pain. Once
you know what's hot, you can then begin to think about a fix.

However if Windows is staying up while Xitami locks, it is unlikely
to be CPU overheating (hot RAM is possible).

(*) Some machines run cooler covers-on, some run cooler with
covers-off. No easy way to guess. I have some PPro-200s in service
that are rock-solid covers-on, but cover-off will get flaky in 3 or
4 hours. So test it the way it normally lives.

i've always run xitami on windows os (win95, win98, winnt, winnt server, w2k
pro, and w2k server). the other guy (garry?) that started this thread
mentioned he was running w2k - but not which specific version. winme sucks
and is the worst of the new ones. i am also voting this is an os related
problem - not xitami. just because only xitami crashes does not rule out an
os problem.

xitami is by far the most stable web server i've ever tested on windows.....

Message-ID: <3DC67B0F.3738.13AE2ED5@localhost>

I don't know if anyone has thought of this, but it does tie into the web 
server and could possibly be causing the problem!  At least, it is 
something else someone else can try to work out.

But first:  how many of us (Xitami admins) are moving database data, 
especially ODBC Access data?  On another list, I believe the DBI list, 
someone submitted an email re:  raising the buffer size from 2048Kb to 
~32768Kb.  Myself, I only raised the buffer to 10240Kb, but it has 
decreased the amount that Xitami has been crashing.

I'd like to hear some input from someone more knowledgeable.  Even if 
it doesn't affect Xitami in any way, I am recognizing that a dramatic 
increase in the database buffer size (2048Kb is default), does decrease 
the server response time for queries.  Well worth a try, even if it doesn't 
prevent Xitami from crashing.

Hi,

Just adding some thoughts to this thread. I run XiPro 4d10 on NT4 SP6 and
the only crashes I experienced (very few) were related either to the FTP or
to SSL.  The server load is small and I sometimes not boot the machine for
months.

I am also using XiPro on my workstation for testing/developing. For a while
I tried to follow some advice and work as a power user rather than an
administrator on my workstation. I noticed that Xitami behaves really
strange when one (as power user) tries to even open the setup dialog. This
did not last long since I use to do a lot of admin stuff/debugging on my
workstation and I assumed that xitami code was not developed with access
rights in mind for Win2k (as some other new software does) and speculate
that there might be crashes related to this when one plays with the access
rights on folders/files. Occasionally I use ODBC and these applications do
crash sometimes, however, the webserver is not affected, only the connected
LRWP process dies.

I have the crashing problem as well.

On average it crashes once per week.  There is no set pattern.  It crashed
on me last night at around 10:30pm.  The crash recovery option is on, but
doesn't seem to work.  If anything, it seems to crash more at night than in
the day.

I have win2k prof, (clean install, and argosoft email) and all recent OS
updates / SP's.  The machine is not used for anything else.  I get about 50
web visitors a day.

In my case, the crash log in the xitami directory has an entry in it, and as
well, the Dr Watson log has an entry in it.  It seems to be an access
violation.

I run a simple site, HTML pages only, no ODBC or anything like that.  What I
did notice however, was that a visitor was at the site at the moment it
crashed.  A series of HTTP GETs were being processed. (page loads).  When I
look into that further, I might narrow the problem a bit.  I don't think
this visitor did anything out of the norm though.

No matter what it is though, I think it's a bug rather than a config issue.

Later today, I think I will fully document this issue including all logs and
all evidence that I have and make a bug report out of it.

Best Regards,
Rob Allen

I have posted this issue before and haven't received any feed back - could 
someone please enlighten me.

My default domain has access to administer every Virtual Domain on the box.  
I want each Virtual Domain to have its own admin access so the site 
administrators can administer their own domains.  However, after setting 
this up, I see the the Virtual Domain's admin accounts have FULL access to 
all other domains as if they had logged in with the default domain admin 
account.

I can't ever seem to figure out why this is.  What am I doing wrong - is 
this a known issue.  What other info can I provide that might shed more 
light on this annoying problem.

HOW long a period?  Wouldn't be somewhere just short of fifty days would
it?  It may be that you're hitting the infamous bug in M$'s TCP/IP stack,
where a 32-bit counter wraps and throws the whole thing out of kilter.
Although I thought that this inane bug had been corrected in more recent
releases of Windoze.

Hi,

I happen to have a little piece of software that I wrote for myself, just in
case the Xitami was going to fail while I was traveling. I guess it might be
of use to some people. It is a LRWP process that connects to port 81. Once
Xitami crashes, the LRWP socket is disconnected and a xitami process restart
is attempted a specified number of times. Optionally this tool was sending
notification emails to my account and I could check on the log of
crashes/restarts through a simple dynamic page generated by the same
program. I anyone wants to use it let me know and I'll make it available. It
has not been tested on other than Win2k and winNT4 because it works only
with the service version of xitami. Also, it is not a service itself, needs
a user to be logged on and it goes on the system tray waiting for xitami to
crash or to serve the dynamic log page. It pops up on crashes, attempts a
restart then either goes back again or dies if it can't restart the server.
It has no supporting documentation since is just a simple, self explanatory
tool meant for my personal use. I take no responsibility for bad things that
might cause to your computer although I can assure that it does not contain
viruses/backdoor trojans/other nasty things etc.

Hi,

Alternatively, there is recovery feature under the service administration of
Win2k which does exactly what you want. There are 3 failure steps that can
be set up to restart/run a file/reboot the computer and also a "give-up"
period of time as well as other nice features like sending a message in the
LAN just before booting.

Good luck

Hey all, I am still having an occasional lock up on Xitami (running on a AMD
K6-2 400MHz, 256 megs of RAM, Win2K with SP3). What I am wondering is:

#1. Is there a way to use something like Task Scheduler or a 3rd party
program to recover from a failure and restart Xitami?

#2. Same as above, but how about just a re-boot of the system?

I am sure someone has to be doing something like this.

I ask because I am going to be working out of town quite a bit between now
and the end of the year and will not be home enough to just manually recover
from something like this.

Thanks for any help you folks can provide!

Mike

OK...I am gonna give it a shot to move to the service version of Xitami and
see if that does anything for my crashing problem. Thing is, I really don't
want to toast anything that is already set up as I went through hell getting
it going in the first place. So, I have a couple of questions.

#1. Do I have to uninstall the current version of Xitami that I have?

#2. Can I install it to the same directory as the current install of Xitami?

#3. If I make a copy of all the config file and then copy them back or to
the new directory (whatever is needed), will the new service version have
the same setup as what I have now?

#4. Is there still a windows based administration panel for the service
version?

#5. Is there anything else I need to be prepared for with the service
version?

Sorry for all of the (what must be) newbie questions, but I am new to Xitami
and sure new to the service version. I just don't want to screw up all the
work I have done to date.

Thanks for all of the help!

Hi,


> #1. Do I have to uninstall the current version of Xitami that I have?
Yes. Unfortunately the service version does not coexists with the
non-service version and although you can chose to install them in separate
folders, the registry keys get overwritten. Before you uninstall, make an
image of the whole xitami folder.

> #2. Can I install it to the same directory as the current install

Yes, providing you backed up all config files. Xitami offers a backup
process when it installs but I think it is better that you make an image of
your website in some separate location, just in case.

In theory yes. There's no easy way assert this. You may have to visually
compare the new config files with the old ones. Also making a copy of the
new config files, just before you overwrite them with your old may help in
spotting differences.

Yes, I am using it constantly.

You may experience problems with log rotation, other than this, I don't

Just make sure you back up everything before.

Stefan, has iMatix updated XiPro recently to fix the serious security
issues pertaining to SSLeay embedded in their code base (that is, have you
received any updated executables from iMatix)?

The last I knew, they have not updated the server and this leaves the
Xitami Pro web server open to several __very__ serious security issues that
allow multiple buffer overflow attacks (at least one of which code already
exists).  iMatix has known about these attacks for about 3 months now and
as far as I know they have done nothing about it.  If they have fixed this
problem, then that is one more thing that can be checked off of my internal
bug list.

Hope this helps!

IIRC, you can either tell Xitami to use the W3C Extended logging format or
use some sort of customized format (using the 'custom' option).  If you use
the custom option, look for the proper format of log files that Analog
needs (probably W3C) on google.com or some other search engine.  The
keywords 'log file tutorial' will probably also work.

Hope this helps!

Thanks Thomas,
No, I have no updates. Never been contacted for any. I guess I'll just have
to continue to keep my eyes on the server. I am monitoring it continuously.
I hope that I covered all obvious holes and that nobody becomes interested
in hacking it because I know it is possible. I also hope that no hacker will
actually spend time on finding out how they can hack xitami since the SSL
code is statically liked into xitami executable rather than being a dll or a
separate module.

For log analysis I'm using Sawmill (http://www.sawmill.net) which works
great for Xitami's standard logs if you select the log file format as
Apache/NCSA Combined Log Format.

I was only asking this because I do not personally own XiPro, but know
about the implications of iMatix not spending 2-3 hours to re-compile XiPro
and distribute the fixed version.

Exploit code does exist for the OpenSSL/SSLeay security holes, but I am not
sure how widely available it is.  The fact that such code exists basically
blows any security measures completely out of the water that you (and
others) have taken to create a secure environment.  If done properly,
exploit code can allow OpenSSL to run as usual and snag plain-text
transfers and forward them to some other location...e.g. unencrypted free
credit card numbers, addresses, e-mail, personal information, etc.  It
would take weeks/months/years(?) to figure out what happened since the
attacker is a remote machine acting passively except for one request.
Basically, this allows for something the equivalent of CodeRed I and II for
Xitami, Apache, and anything else not running on a fixed OpenSSL code base.

The best solution is probably to complain to iMatix that you paid good
money for a good product and you want at least some sort of fix for this
problem (even if they just recompile and statically link OpenSSL v0.9.6g
with XiPro, it would be better than doing nothing at all).

Hope this helps!

FWIW, I have pointed this thread out to the iMatix developers who are
working on Xitami (as time permits), so hopefully they'll get a chance
to at least rebuild the XiPro executable with a newer OpenSSL
(unfortunately it may require some small code updates to do so, as ISTR
a few things got renamed between SSLeay, older OpenSSL code, and newer
OpenSSL code).  (I'm only doing system administration work for iMatix
these days so, alas, I'm not in a position to do anything more directly
about this.)

Hi, I have some questions concerning logfile analysis:

1. I'm hosting several domains and want to do per-domain analysis
2. Further I would like to do per-server analysis
3. I'm looking into
	- webalizer
	- analog

I have setup xitami to write seperate log-files for each domain. That's
working for the log-files of the actual day. The historic log-files all
have a name like ac...-001.log where -00x depends on the domain.

Is there are way to use the domainname as filename?

Does anybody here has some config-files for webalizer, analog that work
with the Xitami log-files? I haven't looked into the format stuff yet.

What else should I take into account with Xitami log-files? Any special
configuration, level of logging etc. that makes sense?

Robert

We recently sent out updates of Xitami/Pro using OpenSSL 0.9.6f.  If 
you own Xitami/Pro and did not get this update, you should contact 
us.  We are in the process of doing the rounds again for 0.9.6g.

And for what it's worth, the changes in OpenSSL 0.9.6g (over 0.9.6f) 
are not relevant for Xitami/Pro.  We're doing the upgrade to keep 
version counters happy.

As I said, any Xitami/Pro owners who we missed in our last mailing 
should contact me.

Hi all,

I had to reinstall my Xitami Pro recently and for some reason I can't get it 
to start as a service any more.  I am using FireDaemon Service program to 
get XitamiPro installed as a service on my Win2K server.  The only error I 
get is:

"Could not start the FireDaemon Service on Local Computer.
Error 1053: The serivce did not respond to the start or control request in a 
timely fashion"

Once again, MS gives such intuitive error messages.  Are there any special 
things I need to do to get it running again.  Here are some specifics about 
configuration:

IP: x.x.x.x (specific host address, NOT all local IP addresses)
HTTP PORT: 80
LRWP Port: 82
SSL Port: 443

I also generated an SSL key that is stored in Key.pem and Cert.pem using the 
"makecert.bat" batch program.  What else could I be missing?

I also recall something from way back when about having a corrupt 
"defaults.cfg" file or even a corrupt "xitami.cfg" file that prevented the 
server from loading.  Anyway I can verify if one of those files might be 
corrupted?

hello
I have been using the Xitami webserver for over 3 years now (P1 166 with =
64 Mb Ram , sharing the machine with a software router/firewall and =
acting as printserver .. and Xitami is working great - the machine is =
probably rebooted every 3 months due to Win2000 updates ).
I got Ikonboard (2.18) running (as BBS) and also I have a couple of =
virtual hosts running but now I want to create a simple page for =
feedback for one of the hosts. The feedback form should either create an =
HTML page to be picked op or even better simply send a mail with the =
collected info (name, email, telephone number and a text box for say 300 =
char) to a predefined email address. As Xitami does not support =
FrontPage extensions I have been looking for simple code (I have Perl =
somewhere located :-)). I saw the SendMail program but I have no clue =
how to use it ... is it possible to get some help? If it is necessary to =
upgrade the perl environment to the latest that is not a problem. It has =
been a long time I programmed but I still understand the basics and a =
bit more :-)

thanks

Philip

Is this list still active?

I just found that my mail delivery had been disabled - wondered why I 
hadn't seen anything for months...

Is the list archived for searches?

I'm trying to configure the Virtual-Hosts section and have no idea what 
should go in 'filename.cfg'... An example would be handy.

Subject: [Xitami] Virtual Hosts newbie
Message-ID: <20021108151326.R54222@eyup.org>

I'm attempting to configure Virtual Hosts for the first time and having 
problems working out which sections go in which file.

Until now I have used DEFAULTS.CFG to hold any customised settings.

Should I put the [Virtual-Hosts] section in DEFAULTS.CFG and move the 
[Server] section to each of HOST-1.CFG and HOST-2.CFG?

Whatever I have tried so far has failed.


If I have a webpages definition in each of three files, ie XITAMI.CFG, 
DEFAULTS.CFG and HOST-1.CFG which one actually applies?

Message-ID: <20021108190039.V54222@eyup.org>

Does Xitami cache a home page somehow?

I have tried to reconfigure things and have removed all references to a 
previous home page, but it still appears.

I can't work out where it is coming from and it's driving me nuts!!!

Is there any debugging I can invoke to show where it is getting loaded 
from?

i think xitami can do caching - but your problem is problem your browser
caching the page.

Hey John,

To the best of knowledge Xitami does not cache pages.  It sounds like a 
browser issue.  Try holding down Shift and Control at the same time and 
then hit the Refresh icon(not the letter 'R').

Erv,

Many thanks for the tip. That sorted it out, both on Netscape and IE.
I must have clicked on Reload by itself scores of times, even restarting 
the browser and the web server didn't clear the old page.

There is not much to tell as all I did was run the install for MySQL and =
it was done. That was the first time that I had ever really done an =
install of MySQL.

Are you getting any particular error message? What is it? What is =
generating the message? MySQL? PHPbb?

A little more info might help some.

Hmmm....I really don't remember what the install even asked me. This is =
on a Win install? Do you have the "stoplight" icon on the sys tray? That =
is the WinMySQLAdmin utility and will tell you if MySQL is set up =
correctly (or a good start). I have Xitami installed in C:\Xitami and =
the same with PHP and MySQL (C:\PHP and C:\MySQL). PHPbb is installed in =
the C:\Xitami\webpages\phpbb directory.

Other than that I am not sure what your problem would be as I did not =
have much of a problem doing the install and then having to troubleshoot =
it. I did have a couple of questions and went to the PHPbb support =
forum. They were all really helpful there. You might want to try that. =
The location of the database files...I believe I left mine at localhost.

Check the following: http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=3D4805

Sorry I could not be of more help to you.

Hi, is there a way to tell Xitami that it should use a special directory
to retrieve the internal images used in a list-view for files of a site?
At the moment I have to copy the /images directory to every domain.

Hi,

I am not 100% sure about your question? What images are you referring to? If
they are internal, why do they reside in the /images folder?

Defining aliases that point to the same one location where your files are
should do the trick.

Stefan

Yes, I was wondering about that as well.  I originally thought the "admin"
port was 81 not 80.  But I guess not.

If there was a way to move the "admin" port to 81, then our (a) firewall
would block outside access to port 81.  Maybe there is something in the
xitami config that allows this.  I am not sure.

extract the zip file, run "runner.cmd" (or rename & change it to the
needs of your operating system), type "http://localhost/demo" or
"http://127.0.0.1/demo" in your browser.

The one from Xitami. I have my web-pages in /var/www/html/... And Xitami
in /usr/src/xitami.

That's where they are by default-installation. Xitami/images

Hmm... I will try symbol-links. Thanks. Robert

Message-ID: <3DD39DEE.23676.99A62D@localhost>

To those who have installed the ISAPI bridge daemon:

1.  Do I need to do anything with Xitami Pro re:  the ISAPI daemon, or 
does it just naturally coexist once started?

2.  I am imagining that this module will cause whatever scripts are 
begun to stay active for x amount of time.  Is this correct?  If so, how 
long do the scripts stay active?

Thanks in advance,

Yes, I was wondering about that as well.  I originally thought the "admin=

If there was a way to move the "admin" port to 81, then our (a) firewall

What does Translate mean here? I have the problem that the IP addresses
of the users are not logged. I only have the local-system-name in the
log-file. Does anybody know what the problem is and how to solve it?

Subject: [Xitami] Is there a diffrence using CGI under Xitami?
Message-ID: <3DD78C74.5265.3B0B12F@localhost>

  I had a question regarding the running of CGI under Xitami.  I was running the Windows 
version of Xitami (latest beta) on Windows NT 4 server (my system for CGI) using active perl.   
During this time I we ran a Oekaki BBS (a BBS for posting art) and it ran fine.  However Xitami 
was crashing a lot and not recovering and it always seemed to be when a different perl BBS 
(UBBS) script was called.   

So I switched to the console version of Xitami (latest beta) and copied my defaults.cfg over.  
Things seemed to run much more stable and perl scripts (mainly UBBS) didn't crash anymore.  

However the Oekaki BBS script now runs different.  We can post msg to the board but the 
picture accompanying the msg would not show up.  We also can not upload picture as 
attachment with the msg.

I figure there may be a CGI setting that I missed perhaps?  Can anyone offer suggestions for 
CGI/Perl settings to get my Oekaki working again?

Thanks for any insight!  Gene Angel

Hi, well I found it in the docs :-| under Administration but not in
Configuration... Not that obvious IMO.

Anyway, everything seems to work find now. One question left. I cycle my
log-files every day. I would like to have one log-file for each domain
and this one compressed.

I know that the "cycle-how concat" can be used. But how do you handle
compression? AFAIK you can't append to a compressed file. How do you
solve this? Robert

I've seen nothing about compression of log files.
But when you create your virtual hosts, and specify a defaults.cfg
for each virtual host, (in a different directory), you can specify
the logs, again ... in a different directory for each.

What I have is are log-files with this pattern:
<domain-name>_access.log
<domain-name>_<date>access.log (for cycled ones)

Etc. So I can distinguish all log files. I'm cycling every day.

I could cycle every-day with an concat to an archive log-file. This will
reduce the number of files and let the archive file grow.

Or I could cycle once a month to an archive file and compress the
archive file. Once a month decompress, concat and compress doesn't sound
to hard to me.

Hmm... I thought anybody here is having such a log-file-analyzer round
running. Robert

Hello Xitami Support,

I don't know whether this is the correct email address to use, but I
could not find a better one on the Xitami website... I just wanted to
let you guys know about Spyce:

    SPYCE is a server-side engine that supports simple and
    efficient Python-based dynamic HTML generation. Those who
    like Python and are familiar with JSP, or PHP, or ASP, should have
    a look at this engine. It allows one to generate dynamic HTML
    content just as easily, using Python for the dynamic parts. Its
    modular design makes it very flexible and extensible. It can also
    be used as a command-line utility for HTML pre-processing.

Why do you care, you say? Well, a Spyce user, Jim Madsen, made Spyce
work under Xitami, and contributed the interface code. I checked it
out, and it works very nicely. It's available at:
    http://spyce.sourceforge.net/contrib/index.html

Maybe you want to put it up with all the other similar language
add-ons, like PHP and Java Servlets at:
    http://www.xitami.com/addons.htm

All the best,
Rimon.

Depending on what the CGI does, you may need to run the web server as
another user and/or grant access to the desktop.  To do this under XP, edit
the service properties from the service control panel applet
(Start->Control Panel->Administrative Tools (only accessible if you are in
"Classic View")->Services).  You will probably have to be logged in as
Administrator to change the service properties.  Only grant the web server
additional rights and/or a different login from system if no one else's
suggestions help.  It might help to clarify what exactly your CGI
configuration looks like.

Hope this helps!

Well, I've had php installed with Xitami and working fine until I tried to
enable PHP's java extensions.

I've followed the instructions for php as far as enabling the extension
goes. From the php.ini file:

--------------------------------------

extension=php_java.dll
.
.
.
.
[Java]
java.class.path=.\php_java.jar
java.home=c:\jdk1.3.1_01
java.library=c:\jdk1.3.1_01\jre\bin\hotspot\jvm.dll
java.library.path=.\

-------------------------------------------


These files and folders do exist on my system and those are the correct
paths to them. Keep in mind the php.ini file is located in the windows
directory. When I uncomment these lines above in my php.ini file. Xitami
gives me this error:

This server is currently overloaded - please try again later

If I comment the lines back out, and run a test.php page, I get the page no
problem. I've checked the error log for Xitami and there is nothing in there
that would clue me in on the issue here. Has anyone had any success
installing php with java extensions on Xitami? Thanks.

Hi,

I am running xitami on Solaris under a constant load (about 10 connections
from IE browser refreshing the same page every 60 seconds) and I am noticing
that, over time, the web server consumes more and more file descriptors.
Eventually, the web server reaches the system limit (1024 open file
descriptors) and exits.

Running utility "pfiles" shows the state of each file descriptor.

Connected sockets look like
 7: S_IFSOCK mode:0666 dev:230,0 ino:28736 uid:0 gid:0 size:0
    O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK
    sockname: AF_INET 172.16.4.14  port: 80
    peername: AF_INET 192.168.1.198  port: 31602

But there is also an ever increasing number of sockets like -
 9: S_IFSOCK mode:0666 dev:230,0 ino:29651 uid:0 gid:0 size:0
    O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK
    sockname: AF_INET 0.0.0.0  port: 0

Can anybody suggest what the problem might be?
Thank You,

Dmitry

[pfiles output]

wild guess: the dead sockets aren't recycled by Solaris or not deleted
fast enough.

i had similar problems under OS/2 times ago.

According to the Manual:

The port is shifted by the portbase specified for the main HTTP service.
For instance if you specify a port 21, and a portbase of 8000, your
server will accept FTP connections on port 8021 and HTTP connections on
port 8080. Default: 21 (the standard FTP port).

What is the setting get Xitami FTP server to run on Port 20?

I want to run Xitami FTP on Port 20, because I have a second ftp server
running on Port 21 for Apache web server. 

I have tried various settings and can't get it to work. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I've often wondered if someone was trying to break into my little
server... I ge these things appearinbg all the time.. And others very
similar... Are they anything to worry about.. And if so how can I stop
them

I always see html errors in the panel.. Are these what that's
reporting.. 

It just keeps repeating over and over again.. And different ime
intervals
And Xitami is the only thing running (internet wise that is)

     Finally got it figured out!!! Just a minor mistakein default.cfg I
was using Port=8021 instead of Portbase=8021. Didn't need Port 20. ;-)

Thanks.

Hi,
Just keep in mind that almost everything is possible. The only variable is
how much time and effort you want to invest in making it possible. As you
grow from a newbie to a more advanced user you'll eventually find out.

Not a joke. Depends on how u see it.  Newbie question. sorry.
    I just wondered if there was a way so they didnt see the ip address in
the address bar.  Guess its not possibly.
    Sorry

There are utilities to spoof a IP.  But there needs to be a return route which can be traced.  
Other than that the best way to do this would be to set up dual systems on separate IPs.  
Have users connect to system A.  Then use IP forwarding From system A to system B with 
Xitami server running on system B.  System B's IP masked.  Only system A's IP shows up.

Isn't this similar to the Domain Masking site's like
Tripod/Angelfire/Geocities use when someone buys a domain and applies it
against their homepage there...

Instead of the standard urls (username.tripod.com)the main page appears as
www.mynewlamedomain.com. That new domain name then sticks in the browser as
you navigate through the site (not changing to the actual url,
username.tripod.com/bikini_pics.com etc...).

If you can figure out how to do that, you could buy another domain name, and
users would think they were there instead of on your site... don't know if
that's what you're after or not.

btw, I subscribe to a lot of list-serves, and I almost ALWAYS make my first
question a joke... It gives me some insight into who on the list is trying
to be helpful, and who is not.

Michael.

Hmm... Is this intended by Xitami? Looks like a quirk to me. Perhaps I
should use a pre-processing script to filter those entries. Robert

Hi,

I have a strange problem with the ftp server. When
I connect from another computer in our LAN using
Netscape 4.78 everything works fine. When I try the
same using Netscape 6 I cannot connect; nothing
happens, no error message, nothing. Http-connections
work fine with both browsers. I tried some things
to tackle the problem. E.g. I tried to
connect with 

ftp://anonymous:some-e-amiladdress@192.168.1.2

ftp://adminsusername:adminspassword@192.168.1.2

No success.

Anyone an idea whats going on?

This is a Mozilla/Xitami bug. I've seen it in all versions of Mozilla up 
to 1.1

I don't think it is related purely to Xitami as Mozilla also seems to 
have problems with other FTP servers

No.

To see your page, the browser has to send a request to your IP.
There are no names (like "www.joc.com") on the internet; everything
HAS to go by IP number. Browsers and DNS systems allow users to surf
by names instead of numbers, but that is a convenience. Any savvy
surfer can find your IP number from your website name.

Having a "known" IP number is probably the least of your worries.
Even if you never tell anybody your IP number, even if you somehow
get an IP number not registered in any DNS, there are tools to probe
IP addresses in sequence or random, whether or not they are actually
in use.

Likewise, surfers can't hide their IP number from you. Their IP
numbers are in your server logs. With proxies and re-writes, the
logged IP may not be the same machine they sit at, but they HAVE to
give a clear path back to themselves so that your server can send
them the page they requested.

Oh wait! you don't have something like http://www.joc.com
registered, so your site has to be entered by IP number and appears
as http://123.456.654.321 in the browser address bar?

(Are you 12.216.50.100 "ChaChaCha"?)

ARE you registered in any DNS? Do you have a domain registration for
something like www.joc.com? If not, then there isn't any way to
avoid using the IP number as your "name". You need a unique domain
name, and its IP needs to be knowable to anyone who wants to see
your site.

Pay the $35 to have a domain name registered. Then pay your ISP to
enter your domain name in their DNS and pointing to your IP number.

There are ways to avoid dealing with your ISP, especially if they
ban servers on your class of account, or if they deliberately change
your IP number from time to time (to make it hard to run a server on
a low-price account). I've never dealt with that, but others here
know how free-market Domain and dynamic-DNS works.

It's intended. There is an access attempt. That's logged.

Isn't there some problem with using passive FTP in Xitami? I seem to 
remember having problems with this. Mozilla (the technology netscape 
6 and 7 is based on) only supports passive FTP afaik.

soory for asking stupid questions: but what
does that mean for me? Can I switch to another
ftp mode in xitami? Can I switch to a different
ftp server and then succesfully use Netscape 6
(I would not mind dropping xitami)?

maybe look at;

free URL redirection will mask your ip to something like;

I think you'll find that Dr Breit was tking the piss; he'd asked a
perfectly valid question, and some idiot (who presumably is no longer
interested in reading the list) decided to piggy-back an "answer" which
made no useful contribution (although he did change the Subject line;
presumably Dr Breit and yourself are threading on references rather than
by subject).

Of course, it would be more obvious to many of the posters in this thread
if they adopted RFC-1855 conventions for quoting, rather than
top-posting...

Probably a dumb question buuut....... :)

Im running xitami on windows 98.  Just using it to learn some
programming/cgi/ssi junk.
Im trying to figure out how to email the results of forms to myself via
cgi - the book im learning from talks about needing to reference the
'sendmail' program on the server.  Says on unix servers itll probably be at
/usr/lib/sendmail - but where is it on my xitami server? Or does xitami not
have a sendmail program - and what do I use instead?


Yes, I know its a basic question, dont tear me apart too badly! :)
Thanks!

Hello from cold and rainy Netherlands.

After months of  very stable operation, I'm now faced with frequent crashes
of my webserver; see the crash log below.
The environment Xitami is running in, has changed recently. Two major
changes are: Winroute Pro (software router) has been removed and Kerio
mailserver 5.x has been added.

Does anybody has any ideas about the cause and the cure of this undesired
behaviour?
Is there any possibility to restart Xitami automatically after a crash in a
Win98SE environment?

Thanks,
Egbert

I have an update here on my Xitami crashing problem.

I have disabled APM (Advanced Power Management) on the Web Server system and
disabled the hard drives going to sleep after an hour.  Since doing that
several weeks ago, Xitami hasn't crashed since.

The reason I suspected this was because, Xitami only ever seemed to crash at
night once the system would more likely be in a lower power state.

So far, so good.

Rob Allen

[The following message contains sweeping generalizations in an effort to 
help someone. Their are acceptations to any generalization. I ask that 
you keep the flames down to minimum.]

Sendmail is a program that most CGI's assume you have already installed 
on your system. CGI are usually used Linux and Unix systems. Most Win32 
coders use a scripting language, like ASP or PHP, that already have a 
mail client installed. Webservers generally do not come with an e-mail 
client.

If youre set on learning PERL or other CGI languages I would recommend 
using AnalogX's CGIMLS in place of Sendmail. Generally CGIMLS is more 
flexible then Sendmail that is my opinion. Of course, I know if you do a 
search, you will find a DOS/Win32 port of Sendmail.

This maybe offtopic but does anyone know what Imatix's STEP program do?  
Is it a VPN software?  Does it just do HTTPS requests to exchange 
information?  Is it something completely different?

-------Cut and Paste from IMatix's website:-------

    STEP creates secure communications channels between applications 
running anywhere, on any networks. Classic message queuing software is 
expensive, complex, and fragile. We built STEP for a rough world. Our 
customers consistently choose STEP to link front-end to back-end 
systems, to build their business networks, and to exchange data with 
their partners.

    · Easy to interface with SAP and other ERP systems.
    · XML-compatible for e-commerce applications.
    · Uses an extensible framework for custom middleware applications.
    · Strong encryption keeps your data confidential and tamper-proof.
    · Portable to all your platforms: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS/390, and 
more.
    · Based on open security standards - RSA, OpenSSL, and more.


    Strategy:   

    Use public and private Internet links to create the fastest possible 
data exchange channel between two or more applications.
    Fact:
    
    STEP requires no public-facing web servers - STEP applications 
remain fully protected behind your company firewall.        
    STEP's security model is configurable, extensible, and based on open 
security standards.        
    A typical STEP application: an electronic payments system for one of 
our customers in Africa.

No. Note that I am not sure if this is what's causing your problem, I

Yes, that's the best solution. Xitami's FTP server isn't the best one 
in the business, even if it's perfect for just getting pages up to 
the webserver. Try GuildFTPd ( http://www.guildftpd.com/ ) or WarFTPd 
( http://support.jgaa.com/index.php?MenuPage=download ), both 
excellent and free products.

Good luck!

OK boys and girls, here's a strange one (at least for me, I have never run
across this)

I had a user of this website (http://www.tahoecabinrentals.com) run into this
problem:
While trying to access the page http://www.tahoecabinrentals.com/cozycabin
they would get a proxy server error (and the page would not load) but if they
accessed it his way http://www.tahoecabinrentals.com/cozycabin/ (note trailing
slash) they are able to access the page (or any of the pages listed at the
site)

Also, I do noticed that when I enter the address into my browser without the
trailing slash, when the page loads the trailing slash is added automatically.

What's with that? Is that a proxy server issue or a browser issue?

FYI Running Xitami 2.5b4 under W2KPro SP2.

Hello!

It's not a problem with the webserver.
When asked for something that is not a file but is a valid and allowed 
directory, the server will serve the page that matches the preferences set 
in the configuration (default server properties). Or if there is no match, 
will send the directory list (if allowed).

A proxi server does some more job than simply redirect the queries. It has 
also to track down who ask some page. If the response page is not what was 
expected, the proxi server can have trouble locating the user who requested 
it. Some proxies are better than others (i'm using AnalogX and ProxyPlus)

Thank you Magnus. Guild did not work, but WarFtpd did.
Maybe I should add: I did not problems connecting from
Netscape 6 to wuftpd or proftpd on linux machines. The
connecting problem only occured with servers running on
a Win95 machine.

This may be interesting to Xitami users who plan to integrate their 
web server with other applications in the future...

iMatix STEP (secure transaction exchange protocol) is a middleware 
tool that implements a 'store and forward' model.

Two applications that want to communicate will drop their messages in 
mailboxes (typically local filesystem directories or database tables) 
and STEP will carry these messages across the network.  It is a 
'level 7' approach in that we connect at the application level, 
rather than at the network level, as a VPN would do.

STEP is somewhat special because it can work over all kinds of 
network protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, but most interesting: encrypted 
email.  It is also portable, based on the same technology as Xitami, 
and lightweight.  It guarantees delivery of messages even when the 
network fails or systems are down.  It uses OpenSSL to encrypt its 
data using standard public/private keys.

This makes it very easy to connect applications that cannot otherwise 
reach each other: there are no firewall issues, no real security 
issues, and no real performance issues.

We hope to be able to release a free version in the near future: the 
package is robust and has been under development for about two years, 
but still needs some polishing before it's ready for mass use.

Subject: [Xitami] Separate server processes for different subdomains
Message-ID: <001301c2965c$942ed510$0200a8c0@utku>

Hi,

I have Xitami running on port 80. I also have a web-mail server on the
same computer running on port 800. I'm trying to set things up in such a
way that:

- If the "Host: " field is mail.mydomain.com, the packets should be
routed to the web-mail server on port 800.
- All other "Host: " values should be handled by Xitami.

As a diagram:


Incoming data-->Port 80|-->Port 800 (webmail; Host: mail.mydomain.com)
                                          |
                                          |-->Port 801(xitami; Host:
<anything else>)



Right now all requests on port 80 are handled by Xitami. I set up a
virtual server for mail.mydomain.com, and the index page of this virtual
server redirects the browser to http://mydomain.com:800. But you see,
that's not what I want. Does anybody have any suggestions, either for an
alternative way or for a program that will do such routing?

Note: www.mydomain.com, mail.mydomain.com, and mydomain.com all point to
the same IP address.

Thanks in advance,

The only easy way to do that is to put a click-link on your port-80
main page: <A HREF="http://mydomain.com:800">Webmail!</a>

If your main page loads quickly, this is one-click for the users.

What -might- work slicker is a V-host main page that did a quick
redirect. The HTML below seems to work for me (with your real URL).
The user sees a black page with a link, but if the browser handles a
meta-redirect (and if your server is quick) they hardly see it at
all before your mail-page opens. If their browser doesn't take the
hint, they click on "Web-Mail" and get there.

I'm not sure what you want, but if you want to hide the real address, you 
can use frames.

That's how i'm doing it

<index.htm> of virtual domain:
<html>
<frameset frameborder="no" rows="0,*">
    <frame scrolling="no">
    <frame src="http://web.verfaillie.com:119/mail">
</frameset>
</html>

(i'm using port 119 on the same domain (and same server) for my webmail 
server)).
Have a look at <http://mail.verfaillie.com>

Paul and Marc, thanks for your replies. Basically both of you has
suggested the same idea, which I'm already using (you can try going to
www.maddrive.com and mail.maddrive.com to see it for yourself, if you
like). However I want this redirection to be all server-side and totally
transparent to the user. The reason I want to do this is because I want
my webmail server to be reached using WAP-enabled mobile phones (the
webmail server supports WAP). But because it's running on port 800, the
WAP gateways that I've tried can't access the server. If I can do the
redirection transparently at the server, I think I'll be able to reach
the webmail server. I'd really appreciate anything you might want to
suggest.

Hello !

I think you will have to do it by configuring your router to allow your 
requests.
imho since port 800 is not a well know port, no good gateway will allow 
requests through this port if not configured adequately.

My mailserver (Merak) allows imap, web and wap.
To use wap, i have configured it to listen to port 119.
This is the port used for news, but i don't have a newsserver.

Portnumbers are actually just numbers, and you can use any number if you 
wish, but since this portnumber is a well known number, gateways will not 
block it.

You still will have to do a single redirect from a webpage (so you can use 
a easy to remember name like <wap.maddrive.com> instead of 
<http://mail.maddrive.com:119>)
Attention, a wap page is not like a normal html page. Even Internet 
Explorer won't display a wap page correctly, so debugging has to be done 
using some PDA.

Marc

PS: i'm quite interested in this matter since i'm also struggling to create 
wap pages.
But it's a lot of work and nobody actually uses it!

If its a Compaq you can guarantee there is a problem with either
motherboard, CPU, RAM or Hard Drive.

I had been using xitami on a win 2000 with AMD Duron 600 later on
thunderbird 1,2 and now on XP on Intel P4 1,6 ghz along with ftp, php
firewall antivirus, mail server, etc.

Never came down, but I always run it as a service, not a program, so I never
see the famous icon on the tray.

good luck maybe!?

Hi:

today for the first time since I use Xitami, and looking at the log of
access this came up:

ay

on okay, completed

I had all kind of trash, coming from machines infected with nimda or

Can anyone please tell me if they know about this?

I have had several xitami crashes on a pentium 133 running win2000. Of
cource, knowing that the system was probably too slow, I upgraded to an AMD
550 and the crashes don't happen several times a day, but about once a week.
I have a friend who has a pentium 3 450 who says he has crashes every day,
and he is changing to the apatchi software. is there anything that can be
done to minimize crashes under win2k?

Hello Paul,


Possible but I doubt it would be because of AMD, I have been using amd
with xitami for over 5 years....

Run it as a service.
Then do not use any network monitor like  those that came with antivirus or
analogx. This is going to put your CPU consumtion to 95/100 %.

Good luck:

Carlos

Ps: My Xitami has several months runing and it never came down...
