My Xitami server (v2.5b4) is running on a Win ME box.... no problems to speak
of.  In addition to running xitami, it's running 2 database servers, a mail
server, and 2 proprietary webserver apps (non-xitami).  All this on a P3/800
with 128 MB RAM.

Increase your [CGI] Timeout = "120" in your defaults.cfg file
and see if that helps.

the below is a virus worm that only affects IIS in windows not to worry

Hi, does anyone have a source to recommend for an easy explanation of how to
set up the FTP server on Xitami for Windows?  I've tried following the
instructions, but can't seem to gain access to the FTP site once it's all
set up.  I have virtual hosts running, and everything is working well.
Xitmai rocks!!!  I'm just hung up on this one part.

Hello xitami world,

Regarding my post of three days ago, Xitami is still hanging.  Nothing will restart it except KILLing it
from the command line and then restarting.

It's 2.5b1 on a clean win2k install - new system as well.

Any ideas...anyone experience the same??

Hi,

I think you'll have to modify the first line of your cgi-scripts.
On Windows-System it will be something like #!c:\perl\bin\perl.exe,
or wherever you instllalled Perl.
On most Unix-Systems Perl will be found at /usr/local/bin/ , so change
that line to #!/usr/local/bin/perl .

Does it have Perl? 

Where is it? 

What is the first line of your scripts? 

The first line of Perl scripts to run on Xitami cross-platform must be 

#! /usr/local/bin/perl

Or whatever the exact path to the Perl program is. 

With Xitami there is no need to change that line for Windows. Even
though Windows rarely has a /usr/local/bin. If the #! line has "perl" at
the end, and the directory does not exist, Windows Xitami will search on
PATH to find Perl.

I'm looking at the possibility of setting up a webserver 
with both static and dynamic content.

Since I have used Xitami for a while I'd like to continue 
to use Xitami for the static content and maybe some CGI 
dynamic stuff.

BUT I'm looking at a program like zope to do the dynamic 
parts. On the zope website 
(http://www.zope.org/Members/anser/apache_zserver) there 
is a page that talks about how you can do transparent 
redirects from apache to zope of the dynamic pages
(so that dynamic.mywebsite.com redirects to zope as does 
www.mywebsite.com/dynamic) using a feature in apache 
called proxypass. 

Is there anything similar in Xitami? I've looked but so

Hello.
One possible solution of user rights at NT is running Xitami as a service
logged as defined account.
You can set the account under which will be Xitami running
in Settings/Services/Startup... - Log on as ...
Use existing account or create new one especially for Xitami and
set the permisions on files as you like for that account.
Used account have to be allowed to "Log on as a servrice"
in Administrative tools/User manager for domains/Policies/User rights/
then check the box "Advanced user rights", find "Log on as service"
and add an "user".
This works very nice for me as I need to have cgi scripts running under
"normal" user account to be able to access database server.
                                         Bye

establishing a communication with the Xitami server. FTP-clients
operating in passive mode are not experiencing these problems.

We have opened ports 20 and 21 on the firewall. Are there any other
ports that should be open?

Message-ID: <200110031823.UAA05253@sxpublic.nxrda.imatix.net>

I'm puzzled by whats happening to my copy of Xitami. It seems to run 
fine for a few hours, then whilst I'm asleep it suspends itself. When I 
wake up in the morning, click ok on the 'Xitami Suspended' box, it 
crashes.

Sometimes it manages to last for a couple of days, but then the last few 
days its fallen over each night. I am getting quite a lot of NIMDA and 
Code Red attacks on my PC, but they don't seem to happen at the time 
Xitami suspends itself.

Would an error message appear in one of the logs? If so which one?

I did manage to (no idea how) install version 2.5b5 - I unstalled it, 
and reinstalled 2.4d9, but some parts (it seems the icon on the Control 
Panel has stayed) remain. Is there a sure-fire way I can get rid of all 
Xitami, then reinstall it ?

Its probably not related, but it would be nice to know how to remove it 
completely and start again.

Any thoughts on the crashing ??

Ben.

I'm a little puzzled as to what your problem is; you say "FTP-clients
operating in pasive mode are not experiencing these problems", but also
say "Any hints concerning passive mode?".

The FTP protocol is _really_ not designed to go through firewalls (it
was designed well before anyone had even thought of the need for
firewalls, let alone actually designed a firewall).  You should probably
seriously consider whether you can do what you want with HTTP instead of
FTP.

If you still want to use FTP you need to remember that there are two
modes of FTP:
1. Active FTP:  control connection open from client->server; if the client
   wants to download something, the client picks a port number at its,
   end and the server connects to that port, and sends the file.  If the
   client wants to upload something the server picks a port number at
   its end, and the client connects to that.  (Ie, the connection for
   transfering the data always opens in the connection the data is being
   sent.)

2. Passive FTP: control connection open from client->server; if the
   client wants to download something the server picks a port number at
   its end, and tells the client to connect there to "pull" the file
   back.  If the client wants to upload something the server picks a
   port number at its end, and the client connects to that.  (Ie, the
   connection for transfering data is always opened from the client to
   the server.)

Using passive mode usually gets around most problems with firewalls at
the _client_ end.  But it causes complications if there is also a
firewall at the _server_ end.

There are two basic complications caused by passive FTP when the server
is behind a firewall:
1. The port that is picked by the FTP server may not be allowed through
   the firewall.  Since the FTP server needs to allow more than one
   connection at a time, this may mean multiple ports need to be allowed
   through the firewall.

2. If the firewall is doing NAT, the address given out to connect to by 
   the FTP server will probaly be an internal address, not an external
   one, and thus not usable.

The main complication caused by active FTP is at the client end, where
their firewall may not allow an incoming connection to whatever port the
client picks; but many firewalls can handle this automatically.

Debugging this sort of thing generally requires snooping on the TCP/IP
traffic at one or both ends, and figuring out what each end is trying to
do.

Generally it's all too hard; and if you're going to have your server
behind a firewall you probably want to avoid using FTP.

I'm a little puzzled as to what your problem is; you say "FTP-clients
operating in pasive mode are not experiencing these problems", but also
say "Any hints concerning passive mode?".

The FTP protocol is _really_ not designed to go through firewalls (it
was designed well before anyone had even thought of the need for
firewalls, let alone actually designed a firewall).  You should probably
seriously consider whether you can do what you want with HTTP instead of
FTP.

If you still want to use FTP you need to remember that there are two
modes of FTP:
1. Active FTP:  control connection open from client->server; if the client
   wants to download something, the client picks a port number at its,
   end and the server connects to that port, and sends the file.  If the
   client wants to upload something the server picks a port number at
   its end, and the client connects to that.  (Ie, the connection for
   transfering the data always opens in the connection the data is being
   sent.)

2. Passive FTP: control connection open from client->server; if the
   client wants to download something the server picks a port number at
   its end, and tells the client to connect there to "pull" the file
   back.  If the client wants to upload something the server picks a
   port number at its end, and the client connects to that.  (Ie, the
   connection for transfering data is always opened from the client to
   the server.)

Using passive mode usually gets around most problems with firewalls at
the _client_ end.  But it causes complications if there is also a
firewall at the _server_ end.

There are two basic complications caused by passive FTP when the server
is behind a firewall:
1. The port that is picked by the FTP server may not be allowed through

I want to customize the graphics of the Xitami WBA interface.

Since I can not find the HTML files responsible for all the pages (Admin,
Configuration, VHost, ect.) then I am assuming they are dynamically
generated.

Is Xitami using a Style Sheet to define color schemes??

Subject: [Xitami] Aliases, filters and php
Message-ID: <3BBB90C8.19780.2A88D0@localhost>

Hi everyone,

I'm having problems when I try to combine and alias with
a filter to a php file extension.


defaults.cfg 

[Alias]
    Owl = "D:\\us\\Trab\\OPENWORLD\\php"
    Tmp = "E:\\ts"

[Cgi]
    Timeout = "20"

[Filter]
    .awk = "gawk.exe -f"
    .php = "E:\\ut\\php\\php.exe"

[Security]
    Filename = "defaults.aut"

[Server]
    Debug = "1"
    Default3 = "index.php"
    Priority = "1"




I have this files:

index.php index.htm index.awk   in   D:\us\Trab\OPENWORLD\php\




I working on Win95
I am using this version of Xitami   bw3225b4.exe 


When I invoke this:

http://127.0.0.1/owl/index.php

nothing appears.

When I remove index.php from that directory and reinvoke...

http://127.0.0.1/owl/index.php


... this message appears in the browser:
"The URL you asked for does not exist on this website"






When I run this at the dos prompt

php D:\us\Trab\OPENWORLD\php\index.php

it works, from any directory. php.exe is in my path.






When I invoke this:

http://127.0.0.1/owl/index.awk

the cgi works.




When I simply put index.php under webpages and
invoke:

http://127.0.0.1/index.php

it works.


That is why I think it is a bug has to do with 
aliases, filters and php.


Any other suggestions I can try?

Daniel

Hi Ben,

I have exactly the same problem. As i have it installed on Windows2000
first thing i'm going to do is install the Service Pack 2. Then i'll see.
I suspect it has something to do with the Code Red and Nimda
because it turned for several months without problems and
it started hanging at the same time i detected these virus activities
on the logs.
BTW, i have version 2.5b4.

I just downloaded the production Windows Service download, and set it up on 
a new computer. When I tried to use the ftp services, it told me it could 
not find schemas/ftpmesg.sch

The only way I could get this working was to copy the templates directory 
to schemas, and rename the suffixes of all three files to .sch

Is there a better way?

Hi everyone,

I've got the same problem (in fact, it was the reason to subscribe a
week or so ago), but I also tried to alias with forward slashes
instead of back slashes. So for example

 D:/us/Trab/OPENWORLD/php

gave the same result as

 D:\\us\\Trab\\OPENWORLD\\php

I didn't want to include my pathes now, it really was the same. I
tried a lot, changing CGI base dir and so on. The only thing that
seems to work is not using aliases for PHP filtering.

Which version of Xitami are you using?  2.5b1 was (IIRC) the last one to
require a "schemas" directory.  2.5b5 (the current beta) should come
with the necessary files in the templates directory.

Which version of Xitami are you using?  What happens when you try to
access it?

This seems to work fine for me with xitami 2.5b5 and Netscape 4.77, both
with and without a webcache in between.

Ie, 

ftp://localhost:5021/

works fine, as an anonymous login.

IIRC Xitami 2.5 (the beta version) includes support for registering with
dynamic DNS servers; it needs a ddnsdef.xml XML file which describes how
to register with the dynamic DNS service.  I suspect this may have been
omitted from the binary packages, but there should be a copy of it in
the source packages available from xitami.com.

>What can be the problem and how can I solve this? The problem is that every
>change I make in the html-admin pages, are not 'saved'. 

The dynamic DNS settings?  Possibly there is a problem with saving
those.  Or are all the settings not saved?

>Is the configuration stored in xml files? I thought it was stored in
>xitami.cfg?

No, the settings are stored in xitami.cfg, defaults.cfg, etc as well as
the aut files.  But some extra information is stored in XML files (like
the dynamic DNS registration information) because they're very flexible,
and there's already code to parse them in Xitami.

The problem is actually with any recursive use of SSI -- there's an
"off-by-one" issue which means that Xitami was storing an
end-of-document marker before the next bit of included SSI, and hence
running into problems.

This is fixed in our version in CVS
(see http://cvs.imatix.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs/)
but not in any of the binaries that have been built.

I think this has also been reported, and I think it may have been fixed
in the version in CVS.

Thanks for the reports.

If you're uploading via a HTML form, then the uploaded file is part of
the POSTed data that the CGI receives (from the std input file); you'll 
need to parse the file out of that.  There are libraries around for most
languages now which will do much of this automatically for you.

Ah.  I think I know what's going on -- there was a bug in Xitami where
if it failed to open a directory it would still try to call close_dir(),
which would then get very upset because it didn't have a valid directory
handle.

I think this problem is fixed in the version in CVS, as I seem to recall
a bug like this was reported a while ago.

If you want to fix it yourself and rebuild the binary have a look in
smtftpl.c (for ftpc_make_listing()), and change the logic for
opening/closing the directory around so that it only tries to close it
if the open was successful.

Interesting.

Xitami for OS/2 was built using the EMX compiler suite, plus REXX.  Otto
will generate REXX build scripts (but pre-built versions of these should
already be in the source kits), and Libero is used for generating some
of the other code (again, pre-built versions are in the source kits).

I think this is due to the disagreement between Xitami and PHP about how
the URL should be split up into extra path information and filenames,
etc.  ISTR last time it was discussed it was decided that Xitami was
wrong, but there hasn't been a proper release since then, so it's not

The XiFusion addon (see http://www.xitami.com/addons.htm) apparently
includes a work around for this.

It's definitely worth trying, as it will help us narrow down whether
this is an Xitami/Pro specific issue, or generic to the Xitami 2.4
series.

>If so, should I run the public executable from the same directory (with

It should be sufficient just to copy in the executable to the same
directory and try running it like that (after stopping Xitami/Pro).  But
don't install Xitami over the top of Xitami/Pro -- it'll make a mess.
Install it into another directory if need be, and then copy the
executable over.

In which case whichever user it is they are running as does not have
write permissions for the relevant directories.  The relevant user
depends on which version of Xitami you are using (NT service, windows
gui, etc); if you are using the windows GUI version it is the user that
started Xitami running.  If you're using the NT service it's specified
in the service panel (IIRC), and is often the SYSTEM user.

You can assign permissions in NT Server through the GUI as well as with
a command line utility I believe.

Was that an example URL that is different from what is in the HTML?  Or
does it really say "site.com"?  In which case is your domain name
"site.com"?

Also if you're using IE, make sure you turn off the "friendly" error
messages, so that you can see what the webserver is really saying.
Debugging problems with the IE "friendly" error messages is much much
harder.  (Instead of getting a message telling you what went wrong, you
get a message saying basically "nope, that didn't work, guess again".)

No, chmod isn't implemented.  IIRC it's done with a special "site"
command (for site specific extensions I think), and Xitami doesn't
implement any of those.  

Basically if you need a more fully featured FTP server you're probably
better using another one that comes with Linux, rather than the fairly
simple one in Xitami.

Xitami doesn't, currently, have anything similiar.  We found a few
instances where it'd be useful, but no one has had time to write
something like this.  You could possibly put something together yourself
to do something like this using a LRWP or a filter.

Check cgierr.log to see if there are any error messages there.  Also
have a look at the #! line of the perl scripts; under Linux it should
almost certainly be saying "#! /usr/bin/perl" on the first line.

I'd suggest at least using 2.5b5 (the current beta release) if you do
want to use the beta version.  2.4d9 (the current release version) is
more stable.

>2. Can I load a production version *over* the beta without introducing

You're probably best installing the production version in another
directory and then copying over the configuration files, webpages, etc,
to keep things clean.  In theory it might work to install 2.4d9 over the
top of 2.5b5 but you'll end up with a bunch of extra config files that
don't get used, and it'll be a little confusing.

This is a server-side redirect.  In theory it might work if the document
is in the root directory; otherwise it won't work with Xitami.  Try
/test.htm, or picking the document path of the existing document and
putting that before the file name you want.

><?php header ("Location: http://127.0.0.1/test.htm")  ?>           is ok

This is a client-side redirect and will "always" work, because the web
browser makes a new request.

The mailing list software, much as we might like it to, doesn't appear
able to filter based on MIME types (at all), which is a shame.  OTOH it
does have a point'n'drool GUI front end, which cuts down on the number
of people having trouble subscribing/unsubscribing.

Besides which if you thought the one virus-infected attachment was a
problem you should have seen all the bounces I got back!

It does have a fairly low memory footprint; about 2MB (at least under
Linux) when it is running. Possible more like 3MB or so under Windows.

You're _way_ over committed on your memory for only 28MB of real memory.  
I'm not surprised you're getting fairly poor performance.

>Why on earth would xitami (the only programming 'running') be
>allocating memory and freeing memory so often?

Xitami does have various "background" "threads" which handle various
things which do allocate memory while they're working.  They should be
doing it constantly, but given that you're so massively overcommitted on
your memory, it doesn't surprise me that the whole thing is thrashing.

Seriously: memory is pretty cheap these days.  Even if you need 72pin
SIMMs, they're no where near as expensive as they once were (albeit much
more expensive than generic SDRAM is).

I've noticed that one of my copies of Xitami 2.5 seems to get somewhat
upset by various worms poking around.  I've not had a chance to track it
down, but there may be a bug that is being tickled causing it to crash.
(Since the worms are targeting IIS it shouldn't be getting into your
machine that way, but all sorts of machines have been upset by all this
probing, including apparently some printers!)

Xitami 2.4d9 should be more stable, if stablity is your concern.

I'd suggest installing the version you want in another directory, and then
copying all your configuration, web pages, etc, etc, over to the new
directory.  When you're happy everything is working in the new
directory, you can just delete the old directory.  (If you're using the
NT Service version you should deregister the service before you delete
the directory to avoid some errors being reported on bootup.)

They are dynamically generated in part; most of the text for the
webpages is in the xiadm??.h files.  This is generated from the
xiadmin.fdl file, into a bunch of fml files, which are then generated
into the .h files.

The necessary tools for doing this are available from the Xitami.com
website (http://www.xitami.com/addons.htm) in the SDK.  The rest of the
source is in the source kits also available from the Xitami.com website.

>Is Xitami using a Style Sheet to define color schemes??

No.  It's a really good idea, but the HTML for the admin screens
predates the adoption of a common style sheet language, so it hasn't
been updated to use them.

Updates (to the FDL file) to use a style sheet would be appreciated.

They don't mix properly at all.  This is a known bug with Xitami.   At
present it's probably best to avoid mixing aliases and filters, and use
something like virtual hosts instead of the aliases (or just copy the
files into a suitable directory which doesn't require an alias).

NT Service version?  It's got a 2.5b1 binary inside it (for some strange
reason).

I'd definitely suggest you get the current beta build 2.5b5 from xitami.com

Where did you download the 2.5b4 from?

"Your site"?  imatix.com?  That's rather out of date.

The xitami.com website is the preferred place for Xitami downloads, as
it's been updated more recently.

Sorry for the confusion.

Indeed so, on that last point: AIUI, HP printers with WebAdmin
interfacing (JetDirect technology) may be affected, even if not
compromised.  Moreover, and far more significantly, the worm attacks can
cause some Cisco routers to go pear-shaped, requiring a reboot.

Sadly, the fact that hardware can be affected like this is a symptom of
the dumbing-down of computery, in that sysadmins nowadays require their
point'n'drool gooeynesses; when I wurra'lad, one configured routers with
raw telnet and TFTP.

Are you going to build a v 2.5b6 in the near future? From the 
Knownbug.txt in the CVS system it seems like quite a lot of fixes have 
been submitted that need to be rolled up and released.

I will be happy to part of the test team, if required, and even if 
pressed part of the code-team - but I have to admit to limited recent C 
coding experience - but either way I'd like to get a version that fixes 
most known bugs

Does anyone know how to configure an Xitami FTP server (v2.4d9) running on a
Linux box to allow connections to a home directory other than within
"ftproot"?  I've have done this with NT before, but can not duplicate this
on Linux (very new to Linux).  My plan is to upload my web pages to my
server using FTP and would like to log into the FTP server viewing the root
of all the Xitami configuration files.

Thanks

I do have some troubles in getting Xitami to return wml-pages correctly.

I want to run a WAP-server on Xitami2.4d7, but something is not working
yet. I have set up a virtual host and defined that index.wml should be
returned. Xitami returns the page, but it can't be displayed correctly
on my browser (I am using Opera). I can copy and past the source-code
from my browser and it looks exactly like the original. If I am loading
the original directly from the disk the page is displayed correctly.

Is there something I should define on the server, MIME-types,...

I have found out that you need append lines into defaults.cfg or
to another apropriate config file (into Mime section):

[Mime]
     Wbmp=image/vnd.wap.wbmp
     Wml=text/vnd.wap.wml
     Wmlc=application/vnd.wap.wmlc
     Wmls=text/vnd.wap.wmlscript
     Wmlsc=application/vnd.wap.wmlscriptc

Worked fine for me.

Thank's, now it's working for me, too.

There is one (possible) bug in Xitami, as you have to define Mime-settings in
your virtual host's configuration file. It is not enough to define it just in
the default configuration file.

Has anybody found that Perl scripts run intolerably slow on Windows 98/NT
with Xitami? I'm using ActivePerl 623 and the problem doesn't appear to be
specific to the machine or the installation. Even a small test Perl script
(e.g 'hello world') type stuff takes up to _30 seconds_ to appear in the
browser. I'm only running this on a local-loop. Does the problem go away
when you're calling the server from a remote computer?
Any info or insights appreciated.

I found out that that happens as well, also i found out that this is verry

Opera, and MSIE usualy are always fast, and Netscape is verry slow on some CGI
programs.

You say you wordk on Windows NT, do you use xiwinnt.exe?? If so, does Perl CGI
work? If so, did you have anny problems installing them, i do, on win98 it
worked fine, but under NT i get this error:

Well, I found Opera and Netscape were fine! For me IE is the really slow
one.
As for your Windows NT error, I'm not sure what this is but it sounds most
likely that it is trying to find Perl.exe and not succeeding. Have you
checked that the location of Perl.exe has been appended to the PATH
environment variable? To find out, simply go to the DOS prompt and type
PATH. In the list of paths you should see the location of perl.exe. If not,
this is probably your problem - although I'm not 100%.
I don't use NT currently, but I did before and it was OK.

It is in my path (have a dualboot with Win98 as well, and there it works fine!).
But I normaly use NT (NT5 that is => Win2000). Also (doublecheck) when I type in
perl.exe[enter] perl activate's, so i'm pretty sure that isn't it... any other
ideas? (just to be sure, when you installed Xitami on NT, you didn't do anything
extra to get Perl to function? (desides installing perl offcourse..))

Using Win 95 and win 98 I have had no problems with perl - I am 
currently using ActiveState v 629 and Xitami 2.5b5 but I have had the 
same results with earlier builds of both.

What I have found is that sometimes when I really run out of memory (I 
have a 64MB machine) then things are very slow. But this is not related 
to perl or Xitami per se.

One other thing that may be is that your perl script is not completing 
correctly and is hanging around. In that case Xitami eventually kills it 
but it takes some time. Finally the 2.5b1 and 2.5b2 versions did not 
pass input to STDIN correctly for CGI scripts. This was fixed in 2.5b4 
and b5 ...

Under NT (et al) does the user that Xitami is running under have the correct
permissions for that folder?

One more tip for slowness...

sometime windoze takes a long time to resolve the name localhost to the 
loopback IP address. You can verify this and/or fix it by doing a manual 
"ping localhost" in a DOS/CMD prompt before trying the webpage...

Are there any web hosting packages you know of available that use Xitami to run their site?

Also, do you know of any sites that use CGI scripts with their Xitami?  Because I'm having trouble creating forms for my site, which work on other webservers (no parts of my forms are being passed into the query string)

H, good one (hadn't thought of that), but i am set as administrator, so i have all
the rights... Also Xitami for Win98 also runs (not stable though..) on Win2000, and
then Perl does run... (more or less, because it isn't stable..)

If you want Xitami to use the QUERY_STRING environment variable (as 
opposed to passing parameters in STDIN) then you should enable the 
relevant parameter

In the Web based admin this is the "Pass QUERY_STRING?" checkbox in the 
CGI properties page or in the defaults.cfg file have a line of 
form-query=1 in the [CGI] section

You may also wish to provide the URL arguments - in defaults.cfg this is 
enabled with a passargs=1 line.

Francis
PS RTFM -http://localhost/xitami/index4.htm  in the CGI section for 
other relevant info
PPS in 2.5b1 and 2.5b2 the ONLY way to get arguments to the CGI program 
was via QUERY_STRING. If you use perl's CGI.PM then you have to manually 
enable examination of the qeury string (its only semi documented in 
CGI.PM how to do this)

I tried installing to a different directory, copied my configs over, but

Make a backup of just your configuration files. Shut Xitami down, delete the
contents of the directory you installed Xitami into. Restart your machine. In
your system32 directory (usually c:\winnt\system32) delete xiwinntc.cpl and
you'll have killed all the remnants of your previous install.

Install Xitami (2.4d9 NT service version) and copy your configuration files
back into the directory you just installed Xitami into.

I'm running the NT service version of 2.4d9 on both a Windows 2000
Professional machine and a Windows 2000 Server machine here without a hitch,
so I know it works.

The FAQ's state that an FTP "Virtual Host" is not supported by Xitami.

Does this mean that an ftp://www.mydomain.com  will not work as an FTP
site???

If Xitami will only support one FTP site per IP address, and I have multiple
web sites, then I need to give all web designers access to all web sites
since I only have one IP????

It will.  But it'll be the same as for any other FTP site that maps to
that IP address.

Subject: [Xitami] RE:Perl scripts in Windows (Andrew Morris)
Message-ID: <01C15242.CADEC200.boyan@sanbolic.com>

When I was playing with Bugzilla 2.12, I found the same slowness of perl. I 
couldn't figure out why, I only found the symptoms. Bugzilla is a 
bug-tracking system written in Perl. In version 2.12, there was a script 
that was finding the differences between bug reports - using diff. The 
operation flow was xitami->perl.script1->perl.script2->diff
IIRC, every time xitami called perl, cmd.exe was invoked. In this manner of 
operation the call to diff took 30 seconds to complete, although the 
program itself was ready almost instantly. When I would execute the same 
script (script1) directly from the command line, it completed in the usual 
fast way.
I couldn't resolve this, but thankfully it was done by others - in the 
following versions of Bugzilla diff was dropped, so now it runs just fine 
in the rare occasions that somebody uses it.
System:
Xitami 2.4d9, NT service
Perl ActiveState 5.6.1 - 628
Windows 2000 SP2
128 MB RAM
MySQL 3.23.39 or something like that
diff - from the Cygnus library - ver. 2.7
IE 5.0

So I'd suggest examining which is the component that causes the slowdown. I 
think that 30 seconds was the default timeout of Xitami for processes that 
it perceives as hung. As to why it wouldn't detect the completion of diff, 
or whatever the reason was (I never found it out, as I said) - I don't have 
the slightest idea.
What I did was to turn on the security auditing to find out when each 
process starts and stops, and to turn on the cgi debugging in xitami, so I 
can see when the files were generated.
Maybe in your case it is something to do with paths and exit codes? E.g. if 
a process is called in such a way that it needs to be found via the PATH 
environment variable, its exit code is not correctly passed back? This is 
as wild a guess as it can get, but with all this software you never know.
Best regards,
Boyan

In-Reply-To: <200110050401.QAA04801@pagoda.in.naos.co.nz>
Message-ID: <NDBBIDKBILPOMBMKDOOCAELNCDAA.alsiman@cofs.net>

To customize the WBA pages of Xitami, it seems the logical thing would be to
give the Administrator a simple form to define the style of the web pages.
How easy is this to accomplish with the SDK?????????????

All an Administrator needs is the following form:

BACKGROUND COLOR: (XX,XX,XX)
BACKGROUND PICUTRE: (file name and directory)
FIXED BACKGROUND: Y/N
FONT COLOR: (XX,XX,XX)
HYPERLINK FONT COLOR: (XX,XX,XX)
VISITED HYPERLINK COLOR: (XX,XX,XX)
ACTIVE HYPERLINK COLOR: (XX,XX,XX)
--
BULLETED LIST:
IMAGE 1: (file name and directory)
IMAGE 2: (file name and directory)
IMAGE 3: (file name and directory)

Adding one more form to Xitami would allow the Administrator to really snaz
up his WBA.............in turn, possibly offering a custom portal for
customers and associates.

Obviously, the inputs would change the configuration files either by
creating a style sheet that all pages refer to........or by somehow changing
the source that generates the dynamic content currently.

How hard is this to do?? I dont know, I am more of a web designer than a
programmer.

I am wondering if the poeple that have used the SDK development Add-on can
tell me how difficult this would be for a person who is only vaugely
familiar with HTML.

Ayup, ActiveState's Active Perl build 623, PHP 4.0.6 and REXX on both
machines. All of the execute flawlessly for CGI processes.

All I did was install perl and make sure it was in my path.

Tey are dynamically generated in part; most of the text for the
.ebpages is in the xiadm??.h files.  This is generated from the
xiadmin.fdl file, into a bunch of fml files, which are then generated
into the .h files.

The necessary tools for doing this are available from the Xitami.com
website (http://www.xitami.com/addons.htm) in the SDK.  The rest of the
source is in the source kits also available from the Xitami.com website.

I HAVE DOWNLOADED AND SKIMMED THROUGH THE XIADMIN.FDL FILE.  IT LOOKS PRETTY
SIMPLE.

SO IF I DO MAKE CHANGES TO THIS FILE WITH A TEXT EDITOR....WHAT NEXT???

HOW DO I GET THE CHANGES TO APPLY TO MY CURRENT INSTALLATION???

Looks like your CAPS lock key got stuck there :-)

>SO IF I DO MAKE CHANGES TO THIS FILE WITH A TEXT EDITOR....WHAT NEXT???
>HOW DO I GET THE CHANGES TO APPLY TO MY CURRENT INSTALLATION???

The basic idea is:
- make changes to the FDL file with a text editor
- run fdlgen xiadmin.fdl
- run fmlgen over each xiadm??.fml file that is generated
- rebuild Xitami from source (including your newly generated files)

You'll need to tools from the Xitami SDK and also a C compiler.  iMatix
uses Microsoft Visual C++ 6.

They're all compiled into the binary.  This is part of the reason it's
as big as it is.  The wsxrc program turns the GIF images into an include
file (xiadmin.h).

>If I wanted to replace a button, where would I go??

You need to change the button (from the SDK source), and then run 
wsxrc @xiadmin.rc, and then recompile Xitami.  If you've added images,
you need to edit xiadmin.rc (a text file, one image listed per line) and
add it to the end of that list.

We received a CGI program from a third party that is suppose to redirect the
browser using the "Location:" header instead of outputting the usual
"Content-type: text/html" MIME type header.  At this point it is not working
and we aren't sure yet if it is because the program is not outputting the
Location header correctly.

What I want to verify is that Xitami does NOT output the "Content-type:
text/html" header by default when executing CGI programs from the cgi-bin
directory.  If it does, then this is obviously the cause of the problem.
And if so, is there anyway of preventing it from doing this?

Message-ID: <001001c154b8$124ee300$7c409fc1@ednic>

Hi all,
1) I have installed OS_WIN XP and deactivataed IIS server.
I started Xitami server and could access to localhost without any problem.
It indicates that Xitami works fine.
I have copied " hosts file " into winnt\system32\drivers\etc\hosts folder
for my virtual hosts.
Now if i want to access to an address eg. www.jf.com ( a virtual host
address and it was implemented into hosts file)
it dosent happen in standalone mod but by dialing via my ISP.
Standalone only works for localhost.
Can someone tell me the reason?
*****
2) My second question is a little bit out of topic but the only way i find
for asking is write it to Xitami forum.
After i start OS in MS Windos modus preintall win95 for starting programs
under DOS i have gotten the following meassage:
" Not enough memory for loading of program xy.exe"
The size of program is roughly 300KB.
Some command both in autoexec.bat and confog.sys cannt carry out( eg. mode
con codepage).
I know that Win XP isnt more fmiliar with DOS but all programs can be run
under DOS in DOS mod.
Must i change anything in config.sys or autoexec.bat file or in
autoexec.ssi???
Can anyone help me in this matter?
Best regards,
Joubin

It should be in the Xitami source kits.  You can also build it with the
"buildh" script (it's just a concatentation of all the other header
files in the right order).

It's pretty straight forward to do -- copy an existing one, and then
(a) change to the base directory of Xitami's config files
(b) start xitami as a server "xitami -d"

To kill it, look for the xitami process (there's only one) in the
process table and kill it off.  (Xitami doesn't (yet) write a PID file
unfortunately.)

You can get Xitami to change user after it has started (avoiding the
port 80 problem), by using the [server] setuid functionality.  Certain
things won't work when that's active (eg, restarting the server) because
it no longer has the privileges required to do things like open port 80.

Hello,

I'm trying to setup an NT4 System as an FTP Server for Xerox Docutech job
files. We currently have a SunOS server, but need massive amounts of cheap
disk space and have an existing NT system available.

Running Xitami 2.4d9, I can get the DT (Docutech) to connect and login, but
its LIST request is not handled by Xitami the same way as the Sun FTP
server. I put Xitami in Debug mode to examine the requests. Then I used a
command window to compare output from the offending command on NT and Sun.

The DT is sending a list request as follows:
ftp> ls \dtf-tests\*\*Job.type
200 Command okay
150 Preparing to transfer ASCII file
226 Closing data connection

As you can see above, this returns nothing on Xitami.

On the Sun I get the following output:
ftp> ls /dtf-tests/*/*Job.type
200 PORT command successful.
150 ASCII data connection for /bin/ls (192.168.0.3,2072) (0 bytes).
/dtf-tests/test1/DocuJob.type
/dtf-tests/test2/DocuJob.type
/dtf-tests/test3/DocuJob.type
/dtf-tests/test4/DocuJob.type
...
226 ASCII Transfer complete.

The above list response is what the DT needs in order to recognize jobs on
an FTP server.

I assume this problem has to do with the wildcards in the path, because I
can list the files on Xitami using a complete path. However, I have no
control over the formatting of the DT list command. Is there a way to get
Xitami to handle this kind of list request?

I pasted in the wrong stuff, it should be:

All slashes are backslashes.

Interesting. Wild-card directory is not specifically supported in
most FTP docs, but my school's Sun's docs have a clue: 

 SunOS 5.5 
 FTP(1)                    User Commands    

  ls [remote-directory] [local-file]
  Print a listing of the contents of a directory  on  the
  remote  machine.   The  listing  includes  any  system-
  dependent  information  that  the  server  chooses   to
  include;  for  example,  most UNIX systems will produce
  output from the command `ls -l'.  ....

That is, ftp on unix is liable to call `ls' directly and pipe it
to the terminal. unix 'ls' typically supports wild directories. 

That can't happen on NT, which has no `ls'. It could call `DIR',
or `DIR /s', but Xitami's cross-platform code tends to avoid
platform-specific calls whenever possible, in favor of simple
universal techniques. 

Since wild-carded directories is kind of an obscure feature, I
suspect you may have to try various FTP servers until you find
one that supports it. If the hint in Sun's FTP docs is correct,
you may have better luck on a unix platform. Be aware that the
Linux default FTP service WS-FTP is notoriously hackable (been
there, been bitten). 

Or, if you grok `c', edit and recompile Xitami's ftp functions to
your liking. The code is neat and clean, but folder globbing is
not necessarily easy to roll from scratch. 

It should be possible to build a FTP service in Perl, with `ls'
features of your choice. I know I could not do it, though.

To my knowledge, yes.  Use a program like WinRAR to extract the files to c:\Xitami.  Note that you will very likely have to edit the
.aut & .cfg files by hand, at least at first.

The installer is just an archive (I forget which format the embedded
file is, but I think it's a fairly common archive format), with a
self-extract executable bit at the front, and a tidy bit of "change this
to this" substitution going on in some of the installed files (eg, it
will set up a basic defaults.aut/defaults.cfg).

If you really don't want to use the installer you could either build
Xitami from source, or figure out how to pull the installer package
apart and manually get at the files.

Since the installer just puts stuff in a directory for you, and
configures a few files in that directory, I'm not quite sure why you'd
want to go to the trouble of avoiding using it if you don't want to
build from source.

Technically, i know how to install Xitami without the installer but I don't
know whether it break the license agreement or not.

I write an application which use Xitami to serve file in a small LAN. I
don't want my customers to know some technical details about installing
Xitami. So i try to install myself

Ah.

Technically distributing it in some other way does break the binary
licence agreement.  However if you get in touch with <support@imatix.com>
it's probably possible to come to arrangement, if you can give some more
details about how you're going to use Xitami in your application.

I'm hoping to test a shopping cart application written in html and perl on
an NT system. I've installed perl an xitami and tested both with a small
html/cgi program so I know the combo works. One of the things that the cart
program asks for is the domain address (www.snoo.org) - how/what do I
specify when i'm running on xitami on an NT system? www.localhost.??? or
what? I looked through the archives but I'm not sure I know what to look
for. Any help is really appreciated. Thanks!

No; those are all SLASHES.  It is the '\' character that is the
backslash.  Don't worry; yours is a very common error in nomenclature
made by those with overexposure to Windoze.  (I'm not quite certain why
this should be; I suspect that the over-use of the backslash as a path
separator has led to many people misnaming it, thus requiring a further
misnaming when referring to the forward slash.)  Of course, you could
always refer to is as a "solidus", which is the official designation in
the national and international character set standards.

I would guess that your problem stems from the fact that NT doesn't know
how to perform wildcard expansion: this is a [non-]feature of the
operating system, and not something that an application, such as an FTP
daemon, can/should be expected to do.

I expect that your Sun performs this by the simple expedient of passing
the LIST command through to activate the standard 'ls -l' program, and
then piping the results back.  This will apply the level of wildcard
expansion that this program knows of.

Your basic problem is that the original FTP client application is
generating these wild-carded requests: is this something that it's
thought of itself?  Or could you write the requests as a series of
scripted operations (perhaps returning a full directory at the current
level, and then working through its constituent sub-directories)?
[That's the approach that I would use with the RxFTP facility if I needed
to script such an FTP client-side operation.]

Richard,

I haven't done any Perl yet (maybe I should, it might be easier to access
the database than asp) but I have Xitami/NT set up so it goes to whatever
directory under Xitami that I want..

I tried snoo.org, but it looks like your server is down right now..

Thanks for the reply Jim - but "snoo.org" is non-existent. I just used that
name for illustration. Sorry for the confusion...

I have the programs running on my ISP's server with no problem. I wanted to
set them up to run on my local workstation - an NT 4.0 (or win 98) system. I
installed both perl and xitami with no problems.

The cart program asks for two main items of information - the "document
root" which is simply the path to where it lives -
c:\xitami\cgi-bin\cart.cgi - and the "domain name" - which, is where on a
unix server at my ISP would be something like www.smart-choices.org (which
really does exist, and where the cart programs are located), but I'm not
sure what that value needs to be on my local system. That's what I was
asking about.

This is a topic that comes up over and over again, so I will explain 
why it happens and what our company did to "fix" it.  The best part 
is that I will keep the explanation and solution in layman terms.

Xitami's ftp server works fine, actually very well... as long as you 
are not behind a firewall.  File Transfer Protocol is an older transfer 
protocol that, normally, doesn't work well behind a firewall.

Here, we struggled with this back and forth, finally concluding that 
there was no way we could operate without a firewall.  Our first 
compromise was merely to disable the ftp portion of Xitami.  After 
all, from our perspectives, the first time we tried Xitami was based 
on the curiosity of a full-featured web server with a small footprint.  
We had always seen the ftp server as a bonus.

Since that time, we realized that ftp definitely had it's place, 
especially with remote administration.  Our solution was to install a 
separate ftp server that had the capabilities to handle PASV 
transfers from behind a firewall.  In our case, we didnt have much 
time to investigate all the options, so we went on recommendation 
and have great fondness for ServU FTP Server.  I don't want to write 
anything that sounds biased, so I would appreciate if others who 
have chosen alternative ftp options to express what ftp servers they 
have that also work from behind a firewall.  And, if there are any 
situations where people have managed to get Xitami's FTP server 
to work, I am sure everyone at Imatix would appreciate hearing that 
as well, at least for the sake of adding the information to the FAQ.

Personally, I appreciate the power of Xitami.  I know everyone 
wants to have more integrated features added to Xitami.  But, from 
my perspective, what most of the Xitami audience are running are 
the freely available Xitami server.  Therefore, one cannot expect 
Imatix to invest more time (which equates to money) into 
developing more add-ons. When one looks at break-even rationale, 
since we have a retail application for which we paid, an application 
which advertises ftp, not stipulative ftp, I would have to say that I 
would prefer that Imatix spend my money (therefore their time) 
investing in better development of a currently advertised feature and 
having it work to it's fullest potential.

I am getting a nosebleed.... time to get off the soapbox. ;)

Actually, I think it's my more recent overexposure to 'NIX that's got me
goofed up ;) -- but I appreciate your straightening me out. Just to be safe,
though, I wrote, "It's the lean, not the slope" 50 times on my chalkboard.

As for the issue of wildcard directories, thanks for the info (and thanks to
Paul Reid as well).

The incoming FTP requests are from proprietary software of a production
laser printer system. So, the request can't be changed -- only the response
from the server. Fortunately, I have found a commercial FTP server product
for Windows that can handle wildcard directories (www.wftpd.com). I won't be
ditching Xitami for general use -- it's still my favorite.

"domain name" of "localhost" should work. Same as you should be using to
open the web pages that call your scripts. 

If you prefer to see a "normal looking" URL like "snoo.com" in your
scripts, edit your "hosts" file like this: 

 127.0.0.1       localhost
 127.0.0.1       ads.x10.com  #damn spam
 127.0.0.1       snoo.com     # for testing cart program

(Some Windows distributions come with no "hosts", just "hosts.sam". Copy
it to the right name, re-start your browser or maybe Windows.) 

The first line is why "localhost" resolves to "this machine", and is
normally preset in "hosts". (The second line is my trick to foil a
specific pop-up ad server-- ignore it.) The third line say that all
calls to "snoo.com" should go to the local machine. 

If there is a real "snoo.com" (or whatever test-name you use), this will
of course prevent you from reaching them. You could in fact use your
real name "127.0.0.1 www.smart-choices.org" for testing from your local
machine, and comment it out (leading "#") when you want to test from the
real machine. Changes in "hosts" -may- work immediately, or with full
browser re-start. In the past, on WinNT4, I could keep hosts open,
change things, and see results in Netscape instantly. 

One issue: some versions of Windows will insist on connecting to an
external DNS server even to resolve names set locally in the "hosts"
file. If you are on-line, not a problem, but if you work on a laptop at
the beach it can be frustrating when it tries to dial-out just to "find
itself". 

Disclaimer: MicroSoft never understood TCP/IP or DNS well, so your
results may vary depending on Windows version, service pack, browser
version, and moon-phase.

> The cart program asks for two main items of information - the "document
root" which is simply the path to where it lives -
c:\xitami\cgi-bin\cart.cgi - and the "domain name" - which, is where on a
unix server at my ISP would be something like www.smart-choices.org (which
really does exist, and where the cart programs are located), but I'm not
sure what that value needs to be on my local system. 

"domain name" of "localhost" should work. Same as you should be using to
open the web pages that call your scripts. 

If you prefer to see a "normal looking" URL like "snoo.com" in your
scripts, edit your "hosts" file like this: 

 127.0.0.1       localhost
 127.0.0.1       ads.x10.com  #damn spam
 127.0.0.1       snoo.com     # for testing cart program

(Some Windows distributions come with no "hosts", just "hosts.sam". Copy
it to the right name, re-start your browser or maybe Windows.) 

The first line is why "localhost" resolves to "this machine", and is
normally preset in "hosts". (The second line is my trick to foil a
specific pop-up ad server-- ignore it.) The third line say that all
calls to "snoo.com" should go to the local machine. 

If there is a real "snoo.com" (or whatever test-name you use), this will
of course prevent you from reaching them. You could in fact use your
real name "127.0.0.1 www.smart-choices.org" for testing from your local
machine, and comment it out (leading "#") when you want to test from the
real machine. Changes in "hosts" -may- work immediately, or with full
browser re-start. In the past, on WinNT4, I could keep hosts open,
change things, and see results in Netscape instantly. 

One issue: some versions of Windows will insist on connecting to an
external DNS server even to resolve names set locally in the "hosts"
file. If you are on-line, not a problem, but if you work on a laptop at
the beach it can be frustrating when it tries to dial-out just to "find
itself". 

Disclaimer: MicroSoft never understood TCP/IP or DNS well, so your
results may vary depending on Windows version, service pack, browser
version, and moon-phase.

The only way to run HTTP on port 8080 in Xitami at present, is to set
the "port base" to 8000; which shifts _everything_ up by 8000.  So FTP
becomes 8021.  As a hack you can move FTP back down by giving it a
negative value (== 21-8000 = 7979).

Adding a better way of just moving the HTTP service is on our todo list.

Hi all,
1) I have installed OS_WIN XP and deactivataed IIS server.
I started Xitami server and could access to localhost without any problem.
It indicates that Xitami works fine.
I have copied " hosts file " into winnt\system32\drivers\etc\hosts folder
for my virtual hosts.
Now if i want to access to an address eg. www.jf.com ( a virtual host
address and it was implemented into hosts file)
it dosent happen in standalone mod but by dialing via my ISP.
Standalone only works for localhost.
Can someone tell me the reason?
*****
2) My second question is a little bit out of topic but the only way i find
for asking is write it to Xitami forum.
After i start OS in MS Windos modus preintall win95 for starting programs
under DOS i have gotten the following meassage:
" Not enough memory for loading of program xy.exe"
The size of program is roughly 300KB.
Some command both in autoexec.bat and confog.sys cannt carry out( eg. mode
con codepage).
I know that Win XP isnt more fmiliar with DOS but all programs can be run
under DOS in DOS mod.
Must i change anything in config.sys or autoexec.bat file or in
autoexec.ssi???
Can anyone help me in this matter?

It's part of "sfl", in the xitami, and SFL source.  You can get the
Xitami source from http://www.xitami.com/; and recent-enough SFL source
from http://www.imatix.com/

Brad,

Thank you for the explanation.

As a customer I think you would appreciate hearing what I would think worth
paying for:

1.) A better FTP is definetly one of them, as opposed to SSL capabilities.
I think most of the people that are running a small server are not
necessarily using it for commerce.....they just want an easy and simple way
to get their web pages up.  That said, most people who do this on their
spare time would certainly appreciate any remote administration or time
saving features.

2.) I would guess that the majority of people who want your server, dont
necessarily want it just because it is free.  I know that I would love to
see an easy to use, but feature rich server for under $300.oo.  It is still
a lot of money, but it is better than the several thousand dollars of IIS
and other servers.

3.) I would also guess that the majority of the people who want an easy to
install/use server are NOT IT PROFFESSIONALS.  My guess is that many of them
do not know how to program, and just want the easy to use Web Admin screens,
and not the config files for configuration.

4.) After using the free Xitami, I would be willing to pay for more features
for an upgrade.  I just have no need for SSL.  I am just interested in
serving up cool pages, not commerce.  I would love to see features that
allow me to use Macromedia Dreamweaver, Microsoft Front Page, and Adobe Go
Live with Xitami.  Obviously, if you cant set up FTP then you cant use
either Macromedia or Adobe products for administration.....or at least it
becomes very hard to do to the point that their benefits are nullified.
Considering that the option of Front Page has already been taken away, then
eliminating the other two options is a bigt drawback for Xitami.

5.) An application server that is integral to Xitami is indispensible.  I
dont understand the logic of offering SSL for secure shopping carts, but not
the engines/servers that make the shopping cart work.  ASP and JSP servers
are necessary.

Last but not least: Offer your clients to buy only the options they need.
This is why people dont like Microsoft IIS.  It is overcomplicated and full
of stuff that you dont need BUT WERE FORCED TO PAY FOR.  If you can offer a
base package with incremental add-ons (each with a price) I think you would
really please your following.  I am certainly willing to pay for more
features beyond that of the free Xitami.

Subject: Re: [Xitami] xitami ftp server problem


This is a topic that comes up over and over again, so I will explain
why it happens and what our company did to "fix" it.  The best part
is that I will keep the explanation and solution in layman terms.

Xitami's ftp server works fine, actually very well... as long as you
are not behind a firewall.  File Transfer Protocol is an older transfer
protocol that, normally, doesn't work well behind a firewall.

Here, we struggled with this back and forth, finally concluding that
there was no way we could operate without a firewall.  Our first
compromise was merely to disable the ftp portion of Xitami.  After
all, from our perspectives, the first time we tried Xitami was based
on the curiosity of a full-featured web server with a small footprint.
We had always seen the ftp server as a bonus.

Since that time, we realized that ftp definitely had it's place,
especially with remote administration.  Our solution was to install a
separate ftp server that had the capabilities to handle PASV
transfers from behind a firewall.  In our case, we didnt have much
time to investigate all the options, so we went on recommendation
and have great fondness for ServU FTP Server.  I don't want to write
anything that sounds biased, so I would appreciate if others who
have chosen alternative ftp options to express what ftp servers they
have that also work from behind a firewall.  And, if there are any
situations where people have managed to get Xitami's FTP server
to work, I am sure everyone at Imatix would appreciate hearing that
as well, at least for the sake of adding the information to the FAQ.

Personally, I appreciate the power of Xitami.  I know everyone
wants to have more integrated features added to Xitami.  But, from
my perspective, what most of the Xitami audience are running are
the freely available Xitami server.  Therefore, one cannot expect
Imatix to invest more time (which equates to money) into
developing more add-ons. When one looks at break-even rationale,
since we have a retail application for which we paid, an application
which advertises ftp, not stipulative ftp, I would have to say that I
would prefer that Imatix spend my money (therefore their time)
investing in better development of a currently advertised feature and
having it work to it's fullest potential.

I am getting a nosebleed.... time to get off the soapbox. ;)

Unfortunately, Alvaro, I think you are wrong on several counts here.  First, 
there is nothing better for promoting small businesses around the world 
than making a cost-efficient server that has SSL.  I would have to say that, 
as a business owner, SSL has greater benefits than just selling products 
and services on the internet.  For example, it serves as a venue by which 
our company can pass secure information back and forth between us and 
our clients.  As for remote administration, I am sure you are aware that the 
server does have its own remote web-based server administration.  On the 
other hand, if it had the capability to incorporate the Microsoft Server 
Extensions, I would have to agree with you.

Alvaro, I think you are confusing me as being representative of Imatix.  Like 
you, I am one of their customers.  Nonetheless, I would have to counter 
your presumption with one of my own:  people DO use the Xitami server for 
multiple reasons, one of the most prevalent is that it IS free.  There are 
other equally comprehensive, if not more comprehensive, web servers that 
are marketed in the lower cost ranges.  A good example off the top of my 
head would be O'Reilly's web server.  As a matter of course, O'Reilly's 
server, at last reference, has both SSL and incorporates MS Server 
Extensions.  If you are thoroughly displeased with Xitami, perhaps you 
should opt for this alternative.  On the other hand, for rapid installation, I 
have to admit that O'Reilly's server has a considerable learning curve on the 
installation, as opposed to Xitami.

Admittedly, Xitami's Help files are poorly written.  In most cases they are
written as if the first-time user is to know the intricacies of editing the config
files.  After uttering that last line, those of you who are techies can obviously
see that I am one of those jaded Windows users.  We are the ones who are
accustomed to the pamperings of "wizards" and other helper applications/files.
 *NIX users are familiar with the processes of customizing usability through
the config files in everything they do.  Therefore, it is not accurate of you to
say that ALL Xitami newbies are at a loss.  I would bet the majority of stranded
newbies would be in the Microsoft user category.

Oy!  That is the beauty of Xitami!!!!!  If you have not realized that and you 
are still asking for your hand to be held, that is the market to which 
Microsoft caters!  Look at the cost effectiveness of using Xitami, regardless 
of whether you are a business owner, head of your IT department or the 
average Joe Blow looking to impress family and friends.  It doesn't matter 
from where you come in this world:  everything comes with a cost.  Xitami 
is free!  Xitami allows filters to be added (i.e., PHP, SSI, etc.).  Many of the 
filters that have become web de rigeur are also free.  Activestate's Perl is 
free.  And, most programming knowledge online is free.  Still, you have not 
incurred any costs.  Unless you are tempted by Microsoft's "forbidden fruit" 
(AKA proprietary applications), you will not generally incur a cost.  Further, 
I shall continue this in the next paragraph (see below)

Yes, you shall incur costs for activating ASP or JSP... perhaps.  Where 
there is a will, there is a way (I had to add one more cliche; otherwise, I 
would not feel complete today).  Larry Wall, Perl "Philosopher", created one 
of the most impactful acronyms I have ever heard (and, trust me:  since our 
company works in tandem with several governmental systems and myriad 
human service organizations, I have heard my fair share of acronyms!!!!).  
His is:  TIMTOWTDI (There is more than one way to do it).  Actually, I have 
made it a personal mantra.  If you believe that you can only build the 
functionality of a shopping cart by using ASP or JSP, I suggest you begin 
your "Summer reading" on these web sources:

1.  Activestate (www.activestate.com)
2.  Selena Sol's Extropia (www.extropia.com)
3.  O'Reilly's Perl (www.perl.com)
4.  Imatix, parent of Xitami (www.imatix.com)

Poor form!!!  Firstly, that is the entire philosophy of Xitami.  Actually, if we 
were in a US Court, I could say "I rest my case."  In closing, 'La gente

I've got xitami installed on a windows NT 4.0 system with plenty of hard
drive space and plenty of memory, with the OS up to SP6. Perl is installed
as well. Browser is IE 6 with the option to not use the proxy server for
addresses beginning with xxx.moo.com taken. xxx.moo.com is defined in my
hosts file as 127.0.0.1 as well as localhost having that address. Other
programs find the xxx.moo.com entry and work well.

When I run any test program, all is well. When I run a cgi program (that
runs fine on my ISP with apache/unix), the browser "loading" bar at the
bottom of the screen moves slowly then I get a 502 message saying that "The
server is currently overloaded - please try again later". Other than winfile
being open and xitami running my cgi program nothing else should be using
the server. Where do I start to look or what did I set wrong? It's a default
"turbo" setup. 

Thanks for any help and suggestions!

Yes: as was remarked only yesterday, MICROS~1 haven't the foggiest idea
about TCP/IP, and especially not about the niceties of the hosts file vs.
DNS.  Consequently, their so-called operating systems (even the fancy
shiny new ones like XP) do the wrong thing; even when you do your utmost
to assist them in doing "the right thing", they second-guess you and
assume that "you know nothing: THIS is the way it's done".

Using OS/2, I could handle your situation by setting the environment
variable USEHOSTSFIRST; however, because I have to suffer the
co-existence of various Windoze boxen on my home LAN, I now run a full
caching nameserver on my OS/2 server, which can satisfy this sort of
request from the Windoze machines.  When it really DOES need details of a
domain that is not in its local database or cache, then, and only then,
does it call my ISP's nameservers (because the boot.db file contains the
relevant forwarders line).

Now Win2K comes complete with a pretend implementation of a DNS server
(you're probably better off forcing it NOT to run "from data in the
registry", when the full expertise of "DNS & BIND" can be applied
verbatim) which could probably achieve your goal: however, I think you'd
find better advice on this on a newsgroup or mailing list related to
running DNS under Windows.

> As a customer I think you would appreciate hearing ....

I'm an unpaying user, not The Company, but I'll jump in and say things
Ewen may not want to say.

[I see Brad got in first with comments similar to mine, but maybe I have
something to add.]

First, it is clear that development of Xitami is stalled. Imatix
primarily does custom software. Xitami grew out of an early project, and
was released to promote Imatix's ability. Since then, Imatix apparently
has got so much good paying custom work that Ewen is chained to his desk
for days at a time, too busy to even peek at this mail-list or take time
to release Xitami updates (or even get all their websites to point to
the latest releases). I gather that they also moved or renovated their
headquarters, another sign that the custom software business is being
very good to Imatix. I'm happy for them; but that means Xitami is what
it is and won't get much attention. 

I believe that Xitami was released with the hopes that a strong user
community would develop improvements. Such has been the case with Apache
and Linux; but not with Xitami. It seems to draw simpletons like me: I
can write 3-line BASIC programs, and I have changed a string in the
Xitami code and got it to compile, but when I try to change how it works
the compiler laughs at me. There are some far better programmers using
Xitami, and some improvements come from them, but most of them are busy
on their own projects. 

>  I would guess that the majority of people who want your server, dont
necessarily want it just because it is free.  

I disagree. I think most Xitami users like "free". Even at that bargain
price there is strong competition from free Apache. 

> want the easy to use Web Admin screens, and not the config files for configuration.

That, for me, was the key distinction between Xitami and Apache.
Apache's config files are huge, full of things that I don't understand,
and the key items are not grouped together. However, considering the
versatile and advanced state of Apache over Xitami, it would make more
sense for someone to sit down and write a Web-GUI interface for Apache's
config files than to try to add all possible features into Xitami. 

> several thousand dollars of IIS and other servers.

MS sent me IIS for free; I have no idea why. It also comes "free" with
the high price versions of NT. Or if you do not need something quite
that heavy, MS PWS (a cut-down IIS) has always been a free download and
works OK. But at -any- price, my opinion of PWS/IIS is that it was
written by children to $ell other software (Front Page, Access, Back
Office, etc etc). 3 years ago I suspected it was buggy hacker-bait, and
CodeRed shows my suspicions were right. It also locks you into MS O/Ses
and backend applications and Intel-ish hardware, whereas many other
servers are multi-platform. At any price, IIS is too expensive. 

> A better FTP is definetly one of them, as opposed to SSL capabilities.

I find the FTP to be quite adequate. Not 100%: it sometimes chokes on
large/many files, someone here says it lacks wildcard directory listing,
and its portbase is locked to the HTTP portbase. Still, except for
weekend crashes when one of my associates tries to upload a month's
worth of vacation pictures in one sitting, I'm happy with it. 

Note that the world is FULL of FTP servers, many of them very
feature-rich, many free. It is no problem to disable Xitami's FTP,
install another FTP service, and point it to the same folder as your
webpages. 

Since the world offers many good free and inexpensive FTP servers, and
many of us make zero income from our servers, charging for a spiffy FTP
feature in Xitami does not seem like a good business plan. However, a
need for SSL almost proves that you are making money with your web
server, so it is quite reasonable to charge for the SSL module. 

> features that allow me to use .... Microsoft Front Page, 

??? A colleague is learning FP, I told her to point to my Xitami server,
and -bam- her pages published. On Xitami, FP "Extensions" are not
supported, but these are buggy MS DLLs that I don't want laying around
in public. I admit I have not much explored what FP can do when dancing
with IIS..... it may do some fun stuff but I also smell hacker-doors. 

>  ASP and JSP servers are necessary.

MS's implementation of ASP is proprietary and was uncommon when Xitami
was developed. The same things can be done with SSI, PHP, and other
techniques that don't require you to sleep with Bill Gates. If you
already have MS ASP pages and "can't afford to change", then you have
already fallen into Bill Gates' trap. You Can Be Saved; but you have to
want to. A choice each of us must make alone. 

> offer a base package with incremental add-ons

Imatix seems to be a bunch of programmers, not order-clerks. Their core
business model is "We'll do this whole business system for $10,000". 3
months of programmer work, 3 hours to type a bill and deposit the check.
I don't think they want to handle a lot of small customers and spend
most of their time supporting dumb questions; that's not the best use of
good programmers like Imatix has. 

Also, even if you only buy 3 of 10 modules, those modules have to be
tested in all combinations so that no matter what collection you get,
they will work together. Testing many configurations adds costs. I think
"dinner with or without dessert" is a better menu than mix-and-match
ala-carte. Obviously this could go either way, but I don't think Imatix
wants to run a cafeteria. 

My 2 cents, and only my opinion.

Hi Brian,
Since i have installed Win2000 didnt work more any web server in standalone
mod on my computer system!!!
After releasing shiny Win XP i hopped for better WX condition but i have
discovered that a lot of programs didnt run more specaily DOS programs.
If you three times reinstall your MS OS in my case Win XP you find out all
program that worked after first installation dont work more after 3rd.
intallation and so on, therefor MS has oppend a forprediction_OS instead WX
forcast!!!
Maybe Imatix have to let sertify the Xitami web server by Microsoft as
certified software !!!!!!!
Sorry, i couldnt find out a newsgroup or mailing list related to running
DNS under Windows and direct at MS you cannt get any information.
I will try at support department if i would find an Email address.
For any further advice and aid thanks in advance.

Subject: [Xitami] PHP and HTTP-PUT filesize problem?
Message-ID: <3BCFF391.1050605@gmx.net>

I tried setting up a simple PHP (v4.0.6) script to upload a file via 
HTTP-PUT. The trouble I'm having is that Xitami won't let me upload 
files larger than a couple of KBytes (around 10KB). If the file is 
larger I'll either get a "Your server cannot handle this 
request"-response in Netscape6.1 or a "Connection Error: Connection 
reset by peer"-message.
Running the same script with the same version of PHP on my host's 
Apache-server works fine....

Turning on debug in the defaults.cfg had the following results:

header.log:
HTTP/1.0 413 Request entity too large
Server: Xitami
Content-Length: 103
Content-Type: text/html

<HTML><TITLE>Error</TITLE><BODY><H1>

This server cannot handle your request

</H1></BODY></HTML>

neither request.log nor debug.log showed any corresponding entry.

Is there anything I can do about that?
Thanx

Hi all,
I could solve my 2. question refer to DOS programs.
Under Win XP there are 2 way or possibility configure a DOS program
1. Generating of a PIF file and setuping this file.
2. General configuration by CONFIG.NT
Now every DOS programs works perfect.
I would say in this case MS is right.
I am searching on Standalone and DNS problem yet.
I will immedietly inform you as soon as i find a solution for it.

Message-ID: <9EFD49E2FB59D411AABA0008C7E675C005FB6B1D@emss04m10.ems.lmco.com>


Hello all, 

I am currently using servlet runner beta 3 for various things.  However, I
noticed one servlet that doesn't perform certain functions properly when run
from servletrunner in xitami (works fine in tomcat).  So  I did a little
poking and have come to the conclusion that the problem is that
servletrunner does not support the request to get the user agent or browser
type, which this servlet needs to do.  Has anyone run into a similar problem
or can anyone verify for sure that this is true? 

Has the source for servletrunner been released yet?

Thanks a bunch.

Yech. Windows File Sharing is horrible. Plus the question was about Xitami, 
and using \\server\share completely ignores Xitami :-)

> 	Can i not use http://www.website.classroom for example.

Get your server's IP address (192.168.0.1 or whatever - run winipcfg or ipconfig, depending on your Windows version).

On the client PCs, type in the URL http://<server IP address>/whatever/, for example http://192.168.0.1/ for the index page or http://192.168.0.1/xitami for the Xitami online docs or whatever.

Guessing in the dark: Is your machine Windows? (What version?) Is the
host on unix? NT?

A limit like 10K sounds like your script is passing the body of the file
through the command line and "environment". That could be less than 1K
in DOS, somewhat bigger in Win9x, very large in WinNT, and large and
often essentially unlimited in unix. 

I'm not familiar enough with HTTP-PUT or PHP to know how to check or
modify that... I'm just hoping this jogs the memory of someone who is
more expert in such things.

Yes. 

That threw me too.

The customary default CGI programs are now considered potential security
risks. "testcgi" has hints of your O/S, paths, script local path, temp
folder, and other clues that "might" aid a hacker. While an environment
report has always been a standard web server tool, current advice from
most security experts is you should not have stuff like that exposed
except for testing. 

Since that's about all that came in Xitami's cgi-bin distribution
folder, for 2.49 they choose to just omit the whole folder. 

Obviously you can create a cgi-bin for your own scripts. (You could even
be clever and use a different name, so hackers who know Xitami won't
quickly find it.)

If you need the old testcgi script, someone here can probably send it to
you or you can extract an older release of Xitami into a scrap
directory.

As far as we know Xitami should run just as well on Windows XP as it
does on earlier versions.  The NT Service version should even work there
if you prefer that version.

Sorry, my fault not to mention the OS.
I'm running WinME (de) and Xitami 2.4d6
The host on the other side is propably a Linux-system running Apache.
The PHP version is 4.0.6 on both sides.

As far as I can see the file is not passed through the environment, as a temporary file is created. For debuggin purposes I output the name and path of the temp file and it seems to be complete.

Any more ideas?

Thx

Well to be frank... you have a problem.
Since xitami never did support asp code you will never be able to run an =
asp page on your xitami server.
I uses the Ultradev to develop asp apps myself but had to trade me =
xitami for an PWS :(=20
I have heard roumers about numbers of "asp-addons" event for the xitami =
but have not so far found any that did work.
If you want to stay with the xitami i recomend PHP as the language,if =
not get pws (WARNING that 1 is EXTREAMLY unstable under W98) Better get =
W2k and iis5 if you really want to work with aspcode.

As far as we know Xitami should run just as well on Windows XP as it
does on earlier versions.  The NT Service version should even work there
if you prefer that version.

What about the "InstantASP" that Xitami touts as their ASP solution.  Other
than the bruising $1,000 price tag, does it work????

--0-1963152090-1003742190=:45984
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


Can anyone please help me with a problem I'm having.  I'm new to Xitami and I'm trying to get it to test a simple Perl script (I've only just started to leaen Perl).  I've looked through the Xitami online FAQ with no luck.  I am running v2.4d9 on a Windows Me machine.  I haven't changed any of the settings, I simply downloaded and installed.  I have also installed Perl (to the default directory of C:\Perl ) and have written an extremely simple script (just displays a line of text) which is located in the C:\Xitami\Webpages\cgi-bin directory.  The script starts with the usual "#!C:/Perl/bin/perl" line (which is where the Perl interpreter is located).  I have published my site locally to C:\Xitami\Webpages and I can navigate around the site perfectly by using http://localhost/index.html in my browser (MSIE 5.0).  However when I click a button to run the cgi the browser cannot find it ("The page cannot be found"  Error 400 - Bad request) even though the file is definitely there!  The URL shows the correct address (" http://localhost/cgi-bin/firscript.cgi") and the file is also present when I look in Windows Explorer.  Why does MSIE5.0 not find the script file???

I'm absoulutely stuck - it must be a simple problem but I don't know where to go next.

<P>Can anyone please help me with a&nbsp;problem I'm having.&nbsp; I'm new to Xitami and I'm trying to get it to test a simple Perl script (I've only just started to leaen Perl).&nbsp; I've looked through the Xitami online FAQ with no luck.&nbsp; I am running&nbsp;v2.4d9 on a Windows Me machine.&nbsp; I haven't changed any of the settings, I simply downloaded and installed.&nbsp; I have also installed&nbsp;Perl (to&nbsp;the default directory of&nbsp;C:\Perl ) and have written an extremely simple&nbsp;script (just displays a line of text) which is located in the C:\Xitami\Webpages\cgi-bin directory.&nbsp; The script starts with the usual "#!C:/Perl/bin/perl" line (which is where the Perl interpreter is located).&nbsp; I have published my site locally to C:\Xitami\Webpages and I can navigate around the site perfectly by using&nbsp;<A target=_blank href="http://localhost/index.html">http://localhost/index.html</A>&nbsp;in my browser (MSIE 5.0).&nbsp; However when I click a button to run the cgi the browser&nbsp;cannot find it ("The page cannot be found"&nbsp; Error 400 - Bad request) even though the file is definitely there!&nbsp; The URL shows the correct address (" http://localhost/cgi-bin/firscript.cgi") and the file is also present when I look in Windows Explorer.&nbsp; Why does MSIE5.0 not find the script file???</P>
<P>I'm absoulutely stuck - it must be a simple problem but I don't know where to go next.</P><BR><BR><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Regards <BR><BR>Jim Gardner <BR><BR>E-Mail (Home) </FONT><A href="mailto:jim@jimgardner.co.uk"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">jim@jimgardner.co.uk</FONT></A><p><br><hr size=1><b>Do You Yahoo!?</b><br>

You can only use servlet (jsdk 2.0 compliant) using ServletRunner as module of 
xitami.

ServletRunner is available on xitami web site

Hope this helps

Tried it a couple of times.  Last week I had a 'lot' of Halcyon customer
support.

I never got it running...

I gave up on InstantASP and went to perl using either flat database files or
MySQL as needed.  Much, much easier!
Now let's see, InstantASP sells for $995. Perl and MySQL are, well, free?
And they work!

What about the "InstantASP" that Xitami touts as their ASP solution.  Other
than the bruising $1,000 price tag, does it work????
    -----Original Message-----



    Well to be frank... you have a problem.
    Since xitami never did support asp code you will never be able to run an
asp page on your xitami server.
    I uses the Ultradev to develop asp apps myself but had to trade me
xitami for an PWS :(
    I have heard roumers about numbers of "asp-addons" event for the xitami
but have not so far found any that did work.
    If you want to stay with the xitami i recomend PHP as the language,if
not get pws (WARNING that 1 is EXTREAMLY unstable under W98) Better get W2k
and iis5 if you really want to work with aspcode.

      At the moment I have Xitami configured on win98 and I would like to
use it with Ultradev4 and the ASP that comes with UltraDev.
      Could you give any advice on any changes that I need to make to Xitami
or UltraDev to make both producys work to gether.
      I'm fairly inexperienced with using both products so would appreciate
all the  help that you could offer me.

Thank you very much!

I already downloaded Servlet Runner and I'm trying now to configure it, but
I have a problem: it seems that I don't know how to specify the full name of
the class that implements the servlet or I don't know where to put the
class, because I keep getting the message:

Oct 22, 2001 2:56:49 PM iMatix Servlet Runner -- started
Oct 22, 2001 2:56:49 PM synonyms: servlet class not found (Synonyms)

and my properties file looks like this:

servlet.synonyms.code = Synonyms.class

Both the properties file and the class file are in the same directory!

Please give me a hint!

InstantASP is NOT Xitami's solution; if you follow the link, you'll
realize that it's written by a different company.  Moreover, there is a
free evaluation version, so try before you buy.

I did try this about 6 months ago, hoping to move away from IIS for a
course we teaching.  Sadly, at that time, InstantASP did not handle some
perfectly common ASP objects, and so was not viable.  They promised a
revision shortly; I haven't looked to see if it's been published as yet.

Mihaela,

It sounds like you are having a CLASSPATH problem.  Make sure that your
servlet class is the classpath.  What I usually do is package my servlets in
a jar file and then use the "java -classpath" option to specify my jar file
when I launch the servletrunner.  I also do not use the .class extension in
my servlet.properties file.  Hopefully this helps.

Message-ID: <2D123C9B36C5D31182B90090279CF9A65A6648@CLIFFY>

I've been running Xitami on my NT Workstation for years. Works great, love
it.

I notice in my access logs that I have tons of requests every day for items
such as 

"GET
/msadc/..%255c../..%255c../..%255c/..%c1%1c../..%c1%1c../..%c1%1c../winnt/sy
stem32/cmd.exe?/c+dir HTTP/1.0"

"GET /scripts/..%c1%1c../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+dir HTTP/1.0"

My guess is that these are attempts to hack into a MS IIS web server. Are
any of these attempts ever successful against a Xitami web server?

I ask this because I had a process running on my NT Workstation this morning
called Proxy Desktop, which I don't recognize. So I'm wondering if my
workstation was compromised thru the web server.

THAT WAS A TWO LINE MESSAGE!!!!! WHAT IS WRONG WITH WHAT WAS WRITTEN ABOVE??

IT WAS SENT ONLY ONCE, AND THE MESSAGE I SENT TO WAS ACTUALLY SHORTER THAN

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A DUAL POST??? THIS WAS SENT ONCE AND ONLY

Can't find any trace of a successful hack.

The hint I immediately think of with Java is that the filenames are case
sensitive; whilst Windoze is quite happy with any spelling of source and
class names, java.exe and similar programs all look for the file with the
exact spelling.  It can be very confusing on a computer that, like
Windows (or, for that matter, OS/2 with HPFS) can permit filenames to be
written in upper, lower or mixed case, and yet the filesystem itself will
find the file with any form of the letters.

Could that be a factor here (I know nothing about supporting JSP through
ServletRunner)?

The other idea that springs to mind is do you have a CLASSPATH
environment variable?  If this does not include '.', the current
directory, classes will only be sought in the directories listed in the
path; this is a security feature.

He's complaining about your HTML e-mail. HTML mails are around three times 
as big as plain text ones, are rarely any more useful (most of the time 
they just enable people to send you uglier and more intrusive spam), and if 
you look at them in a non-HTML e-mail client, they appear twice: once in 
plain text and once in badly written HTML (since it's automatically written 
by Outlook and isn't efficiently coded at all).

While we're doing netiquette rants, perhaps I should ask you to only quote 
the bits of previous messages you need to - if you're sending a 2-line 
message, anything more than a paragraph of quoting seems a bit excessive.

It's one of the recent IIS viruses trying to escape from the server root, 
run cmd.exe (NT's version of command.com (DOS) or /bin/sh (Unix)), and get 
a directory listing ("cmd.exe /c dir") in preparation for further cracking. 
This is not because your server is infected, it's because someone else's is.

You can't :-)  Windows doesn't support file permissions like that.  Any
program, and any user, can do anything they like under Windows.  So just
ignore the instructions about needing to change file permissions;
they're for Unix/Linux (and to a lesser extent Windows NT which uses a
slightly different model).

Is there a known problem with Netscape6.1(de) final (WinME/de) and the WBA?
The main screen seems to load fine, but none of the links exept "help" 
will lead to no result. It seems to be a problem with the used

while all the others are.

I had this problem with Mozilla 0.95 on Linux; since Netscape 6.1 is a 
modified version of an earlier Mozilla build, it makes sense that you get 
the same problem. Disable Javascript in defaults.cfg by editing it with 
Notepad (I think German Windows calls it "Editor") and adding this:

------------------- begin
[Console]
    Javascript = "0"
------------------- end

The WBA should work nicely after that. It works for me, anyway.

Yes it is a known problem. I reported it ages back. You can fix it by 
doing a replace of certain "arguments" strings with "argumints" instead.

You don't. Basically anybody can do anything to any file in Win9x.

unix docs often need translation for use on Windows. What isn't working?

"NS6" is full of bugs and "changed features". Its textarea function
corrupted every link when I edited a site only editable via a browser...
took hours to recover. 

The specific conflict between "NS6" and Xitami WBA is that "NS6" defined
a new javascript word that is the same as Xitami uses in links. Simon
says disable "NS6"'s javascript-- I say never use "NS6" for anything
that has to work "right".

Most operating systems don't have CP/M-type "disk letters" and multiple
roots; many cross-platform scripts can be baffled by this. 

Sometimes you just need to go through ALL your settings and make sure
they have drive letters. 

> disk c:\ 

Tip: when setting up webservers and their frills, unless told otherwise,
only use the forward-slash "/" to define paths, even on DOS\Windows. In
almost all cases, this works (even at a Windows command line); C and
Perl programmers use "\" for something else so if they didn't handle the
DOS case perfectly the \-ed path gets mangled. 

For your quickie performance test: it may be easiest to move some stuff
off of C: to D:, then install your scripts on C:. When tested, move
stuff back. Mass-copying may be quicker than wondering why the program
does not like "D:\".

Ummm.

If you are running a perl CGI script and the perl CGI script in question 
is trying to read or modify a file in a non-existent directory then it 
may be returning an error that is then mangled like this.

For example if you do an
  open <FILE> ">/usr/tmp/tmpfile" somewhere in your script but you have 
no /usr/tmp directory - which is rarely the case in windows - then you

and helpfully suggest you need permissions changed when actually what 
you need to do is either create the directories /usr and /usr/tmp/ or 
(better) change the path to something suitable such as /windows/TEMP/. 
By the way it is worth noting that activestate perl is pretty relaxed 
about / and \ as is Xitami so its better to use / unless you really have 
to speciff C:\windows\temp\filename because zou have to pass this to a 
command shell.

Errm, paths with forward slashes are accepted just about anywhere in
Windoze *except* in a command window; there, the forward slash introduces
switches (cf. with use of '-' in Unix).  Certainly internally all the
file manipulation functions and APIs do indeed accept forward slashes.
But not in an "MS-DOS Prompt".  Once upon a time, one could run a little
utility program which changed the "switch character", which is held in
one byte within DOS's interrupt vector, and thus use '-' to introduce
switches on a command-line: one could then indeed use '/' as a path
separator.

Sadly, MICROS~1 deliberately broke this at DOS V5.0, so even if the
vector content is changed, command windows still only accept '\' as a
path separator.

However, I fully support your viewpoint that ONLY the forward slash
should be used within configuration files; only use a backslash (which
might require escaping as "\\") in situations where the forward slash is
unacceptable to some bit of Windoze code.

Permission denied

The same for the errors.log and xitami.log

The settings are that every 24 hours the logs are renamed to the

I did not have this problem before.

What could be the cause?

Is it possible that the logs are locked by MS Windows when there's a

Thanks for reply Paul.

Am trying to set up a database called woda-uk-4-151-pl which comes in a .zip
compressed form. The various scripts state that it is suitable for use with
Xitami but I am getting all sorts of problems. I think you may be right wrt
the Unix conversion. Perhaps I should ditch it and look for another script.

All I am really looking for is a simple database with online admin, (not
viewer modifiable), full search facilities, and of course images. Any ideas
gratefully received.

BTW I have used Xitami successfully for scripts such as commerce.cgi,
everyauction etc so I ought to be able to solve it really!!!!

I read an article recently about how hackers can get into IIS systems using
Unicode sequences (such as the %255c shown below), which IIS does not
process correctly and causes it to allow access to areas of the hard disk
which should be under security. Looks like a hacker is trying to view your
root directory contents by executing the DIR command using cmd.exe...

 - Excerpt from article -
Top Vulnerabilities to Windows Systems (W)
W1 - Unicode Vulnerability (Web Server Folder Traversal)
W1.1 Description:
Unicode provides a unique number for every character, no matter what the
platform, no matter what the program, no matter what the language. The
Unicode Standard has been adopted by most vendors, including Microsoft. By
sending an IIS server a carefully constructed URL containing an invalid
Unicode UTF-8 sequence an attacker can force the server to literally walk
up and out of a directory and execute arbitrary scripts. This type of
attack is also known as the directory traversal attack.

The Unicode equivalents of / and \ which are %2f and %5c, respectively.
However, you can also represent these characters using so-called "overlong"
sequences. Overlong sequences are technically invalid Unicode
representations that are longer than what is actually required to represent
the character. Both / and \ can be represented with a single byte. An
overlong representation, such as %c0%af for / represents the character using
two bytes. IIS was not written to perform a security check on overlong
sequences. Thus, passing an overlong Unicode sequence in a URL, will bypass
Microsofts security checks. If the request is made from a directory marked
as "executable" the attacker can cause the executable files to be executed
on the server. Additional information on the Unicode threat can be found at:

http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/p/doc.asp?id=57&face=2


The full URL of the article is at http://66.129.1.101/top20.htm

Hope this helps...I'm not expert but your e-mail reminded me of the article.
Looks like its only an IIS threat anyway.

I've been running Xitami on my NT Workstation for years. Works great, love
it.

I notice in my access logs that I have tons of requests every day for items
such as

"GET
/msadc/..%255c../..%255c../..%255c/..%c1%1c../..%c1%1c../..%c1%1c../winnt/sy
stem32/cmd.exe?/c+dir HTTP/1.0"

"GET /scripts/..%c1%1c../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+dir HTTP/1.0"

My guess is that these are attempts to hack into a MS IIS web server. Are
any of these attempts ever successful against a Xitami web server?

I ask this because I had a process running on my NT Workstation this morning
called Proxy Desktop, which I don't recognize. So I'm wondering if my
workstation was compromised thru the web server.

Reading the Xitami-manual about language support for browser-requested
html-files I don't quite understand how this should work.

If Xitami is asked to request for the file 'file.htm' it.

1.) first looks if the file 'file.html' is available.

2.) If not, it looks after (take french in this example)...

    file.htm.fr
    file.htm_fr
    ..
    ..

In my opinion 1.) and 2.) should change position. You should have a
default file, but that should only be taken if none of the other is
available.

>  is Xitami hack-proof?

Nothing is hack-proof. 

Let's look at what a hacker can do:

 1) crash your server. Most complex software has some combination of
unexpected input that will confuse it to death. Older versions of Xitami
on DOS/Win would lock-up if you request the file "/LPT1"... it waits
forever for the printer to supply data. But there are ways to make your
server inaccessible no matter what software it runs; ping-floods are a
popular trick.

 2) read your secret data. A good webserver on a good O/S has a very
clear policy about what files may or may not be served. I have not heard
of any Xitami hacks like this, and only one minor Apache hack. IIS seems
to have a big loophole in how it parses invalid meta-characters and a
carefully designed URL can read anything on an unpatched IIS machine. 

 3) infect your server. Install the hacker's code to run on your
machine, either to aid in an attack on another machine or to give the
hacker access to your secret files. It isn't that easy to make a
computer run arbitrary code. The easiest way is to find a telnet login
with no password and ample permissions. Another way is to hit a
protected login with a VERY long username or password that overflows the
login code and inserts malicious code where it will be run; this
requires specific knowledge of the binary code behind the login. CodeRed
exploits something like that in how IIS handles URL query-strings. 

Note that a specific attack on the "wrong" machine may have unintended
side-effects. CodeRed does not infect H-P printers, but a CodeRed attack
can cause the printer to lock-up and need a re-boot. 

However, Xitami is well designed (simple direct code), and is too
uncommon to attract hacker's direct interest. The only side-effect of
CodeRed attacks is bloated log files. I'd rather watch my logs grow than
suffer the pains of IIS operators. 

Most hacks have to target specific flaws in the server-- the hacker has
to know the insides of the code or behavior. For best effect, hackers
study the most-used servers: Apache and IIS. Apache is fairly clean and
has a large support community capable of quick patches. IIS is a mess
and it takes MS a long time to even admit there is a problem. (There are
a few other big servers popular for e-Commerce, like iPlanet, and these
are targeted by hackers to gain money-info.)

We don't know how many vulnerabilities exist in Xitami. But Xitami has
NO code in common with the hacker-favorites, Apache and IIS, so attacks
that work on the big servers are not liable to infect Xitami. Even if a
CodeRed-type worm were possible on Xitami, it would have a fairly hard
time finding another Xitami server to infect. 

 "GET /msadc/..%255c..
 "GET /scripts/..%c1%1c../

Someone is trying to exploit IIS's directories and flaws. They are too
dumb to notice that yours is not a IIS server. (These attacks are
automated; it is quicker to poke blindly than to check to see if the
target is the right brand.)

-OR-... your network administrator is testing to see if any machines on
her subnets are potential targets of a CodeRed-type attack. My
university has been "hack-testing" every machine here and referring any
vulnerabilities found to the responsible person. They found an old
version of WU-FTP, one that I know can be over-flowed and subverted, on
one of "my" boxes. Someone else actually manages that machine, so I was
glad that my net-bosses told me of his sin.

Figured it out (partly) - redirects work by doing something like

.if %errorcondition%
  <HTML><HEAD><TITLE>XML Error</TITLE>
  <meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; 
URL=http://$(HTTP_HOST:lower)/page.html"></HEAD>
  <BODY></BODY></HTML>
.  abort
.endif

 if  you replace the redirect 'URL=http://$(HTTP_HOST:lower)/page.html' 
with 'URL=http://$(HTTP_HOST:lower)/error?321' you get a error 321 page

 if you want a meaningful 404 error you do 
'URL=http://$(HTTP_HOST:lower)/$(PATH_INFO:lower)/error' which a) logs 
the error in a form that allows you to track it in the xitami log and b)

I'm trying to get started using the free version, and am finding the 
documentation assumes I know much more than I do.  To begin with, I'm 
trying to get into the configuration page.  As instructed in the .aug file, 
I've tried to supply a username and password, but can't even figure out 
where to put them.  the password seems easy to provide, but not the 
username, and all combinations I try result in logon failure.

I'm assumng that once I get into the configuration page, I will be able to 
solve this: I log on to the net via Earthlink, but my domain is obviously 
not on Earthlink, and I have a dynamic IP address.  Any tips on directing 
the server to handle this correctly will be most welcome.

Thank you in advance.

I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to achieve here. I'll assume you 
want to run Xitami on a reasonably workstation-type computer rather than a 
dedicated server.

First, try using Xitami with a web browser running on the same computer as 
Xitami itself, while claiming your IP address is "127.0.0.1". This is a 
reserved IP - *any* computer told to connect to 127.0.0.1 will connect to 
itself. http://127.0.0.1/admin should get you into the admin screen without 
even being connected to the Internet (note: you may need to turn off 
auto-dialling if you're using Internet Explorer and a dialup modem; my 
apologies if this sounds stupid, but I'm in the UK so I have no idea 
whether Earthlink is a dialup provider or cable or DSL or what).

Once it works with 127.0.0.1, try your dynamic IP (as reported by 
winipcfg). Unfortunately, your hostname will change with your IP (on many 
dynamic IP systems your hostname is something like 
modem-143.server-3.dialup.obscure.net) so giving your address to your 
friends could be tricky unless you use a dynamic DNS system (the Xitami 
docs include links to dyndns.org and others).

As for your domain, I can't tell how it's set up - is sound-computing.com a 
spare server box you own, or hosted on someone else's web server, or your 
workstation, or what? If that's not the machine you're trying to run Xitami 
on (which I assume it isn't since it's already running some other web 
server), it's irrelevant. For example, I have a domain which points to a 
commercial web host's Linux box (running Apache and various other servers), 
but that's completely irrelevant when I'm setting up Xitami on my own 
computer (whose domain is usually something horrible like 
modem-143.server-3.dialup.obscure.net).

It may be disabled by default. Here is a fairly simple set of stuff to 
do (this assumes you have a clean Xitami config - ie. no changes to 
anything after the initial installation). It is possible that some or 
all of these steps will be performed during the installation so this is 
partly a check to make sure it is working right.

step 1.
Create (or edit ) a file called defaults.cfg in the xitami directory 
(usually c:\xitami\ for windows) and add a section as below:

[Security]
    Filename = "defaults.aut"

Save this file

step 2.
Create (or edit ) a file called defaults.aut in the xitami directory 
(usually c:\xitami\ for windows) and add a section as below:

[/admin]
    SecureName = "SecurePassword"

(obviously pick a different name/password combination to the above 
unless you want us to hack in!)
Save this file

step 3.
Check that Xitami is running (you have a green X icon in the system 
tray). It may already be running, if so thats fine if not run Xitami. If 
you don't get a green little icon then theres a problem right there. 
Possible errors (resulting in a red icon) are that you accidentally have 
another web server running

step 4
Start up your web browser and point it to http://localhost/ or 
http://127.0.0.1
You should get a Welcome to Xitami  screen

Somehwere on the left hand side you will see some text that say
'To configure the server, use the web-based admin 
<http://localhost/admin> function. This is password-protected.'
click on the link and enter the secureUser and securePassword you put in 
defualts.aut above
you should now be in the first admin screen- Click configuration to 
start configuring things

If you get to the first screen but all clicks just return you to it the 
most likely thing is that you are running a Netscape 6.x / Mozilla 
browser which objects to some Javascript that Xitami uses. Use a 
different browser would be my suggestion.

thank you, Simon and Francis, for your help.

I'm still missing something.

Defaults.aut already existed.  Here's what it looks like now, after my edit:

[/Admin]
     admin="xxx"
     SecureName="xxx"

XXX is replaced by a name of my choosing.  They are identical, all 
lowercase.  I made them identical because (a) it shouldn't matter, and (b) 
I still can't figure out quite where I'm designating a username in this 
process.

I closed and restarted Xitami since as I understand, it only reads this 
file on startup.  the setup option from the menu takes me to the 
username/password entry screen, I enter my version of xxx in both boxes and 
I am still told they are invalid.

What am I missing/

Message-ID: <E15wt3F-0001eG-00@entropy.ucam.org>

In defaults.aut, the word before the = is your username, and the word after 
the = is your password. For example, this will let you log in to 
http://127.0.0.1/admin as a user "eviloverlord" with password "topsecret":

[/Admin]
    eviloverlord=topsecret

If you have admin=xxx and SecureName=xxx lines, you can log in as either of 
the users "admin" or "SecureName", with password "xxx" in either case. I 
assume you don't want this.

The one exception to this is "webmask=something", which sets which 
computers can access the admin screen (webmask=local will restrict it to 
the computer the server is actually running on).

If you're using Netscape 6 or Mozilla, you may need to edit defaults.cfg 
and add this:

[Console]
    Javascript = "0"

(if the [Console] section is already there, either add the Javascript key 
or edit it to switch it to 0). I couldn't use the Javascript admin 
interface with Mozilla 0.94, but it works now (in Mozilla 0.95), so your 
mileage may vary. I actually considered sending iMatix a patch to use 
different Javascript function names to avoid this problem, but the names 
are hard-coded into their form generating tool :-(
I might still try adapting it so the Javascript isn't critical: if I do, 
I'll definitely let iMatix know so they can merge it into some future 
version.

If you have a really screwed config, adding this to defaults.cfg may help:

[Wsx]
    admin=xiadmin

although this shouldn't be necessary.

Subject: [Xitami] CGI Scripting
Message-ID: <000301c15e29$a7e24ae0$6400000a@techapp.co.uk>

I have a Perl script in webroot/cgi-bin, which reads a text file in and
outputs it in HTML format to the requesting browser (see smaple script
below). Well, that's what it's supposed to do.

It works at the DOS prompt, opening the file and printing output to the
screen. However, if I try the script through a browser, the server returns
no file contents. I assumed the problem was a permissions error, so as a
brute force resolution, I gave Everyone, Full Permissions to the cgi-bin
directory, which still doesn't work.

The Xitami server itself is running under the NT Administrator user, so
should definitely be included in the Everyone group and have full
permissions to all files on the local machine. The working dir. is set to
"-" as recommended, yet it manages to create temporary files in D:\Temp,
which contain the output sent to the screen. So why can't it read in the
files?

#!perl

# Define Variables

# Read Name of Script
	$Script = $ENV{'SCRIPT_NAME'};

# Open Script
	open(TXT, "<".$Script);
	@text=<TXT>;
	close(TXT);

# Print Script to screen
	&Header;
	print "\nScript to be processed: <b>".$Script."</b><hr>";
	foreach $line(@text){
		print "$line.<br>";
		$lines++;
	}
	if($lines<1){$lines="no"};
	&Footer;

sub Header{
	print "content-type:text/html\n\n<html>";
	print "<title>View File Script</title>";
}

sub Footer{
	print "There are <b>".$lines."</b> lines<br>";
	print "<b>The End</b>";
	print "</html>";

Does a basic Hello World! perl script work through a browser? 

 #! fee/fie/perl
 print "Hello World";

Ugh, that's asking for trouble. Better to be in /Xitami/cgi-bin, OUTSIDE
the webpages folder, so nobody can read it.

To be a real CGI script (i.e. one that will work) I believe that's

---- begin
#!/usr/bin/perl

# for Windows + ActivePerl the above should work anyway;
# if not, use #!c:/perl/bin/perl or whatever

print "Content-Type:text/plain\n\n";
print "Hello, World!\n";
---- end

since you need at least a Content-Type header and a blank line (so two 
consecutive newlines) before the content starts.

Indeed, is that the problem? /cgi-bin is (by default) an alias for 
c:\xitami\cgi-bin, which makes c:\xitami\webroot\cgi-bin "invisible" to the 
server...

David check the cgierr.log in xitami root it should have
something also
#! perl should be fine in windows if perl is set in your path
and always

use strict;
this will point you to most errors

# Define Variables? no your not use my()
my ($Script, $lines, @text, $line);

you may also want to 
use CGI::Carp "fatalsToBrowser"; #shows error in browser

# Read Name of Script...

        $Script = $ENV{'SCRIPT_NAME'};
		
       if ($Script eq "") {$Script = "default.txt"};
       
	not sure if $Script here is getting set it may be empty
and empty and "" are differant set $Script ="" 
before the $ENV{'SCRIPT_NAME'}

# Open Script....Always die with $! to let you know
        open(TXT, "<".$Script)|| die "Can't Open ::$Script:: $!\n";
        @text=<TXT>;
        close(TXT);

read up on the doc's good stuff in there:)

I just signed up to the list as I need some advice/assistance. Please bear
with me if you have already discussed this.

I use MS FrontPage 98 and MS Personal Web Server on my desktop on a daily
basis to update and test my web site. The site is then published to a 3rd
party web server.

On Thursday I purchased and load Windows XP Home Edition. PWS is not
supported and cannot be loaded. XP Home edition does not have a server
included (the Pro version has IIS 5.0). As I could not use FP98 I had to
uninstall XP!!!

My questions to the group are:
Will Xitami operate with WinXP?
Does Xitami work with FP98?

Again, all I want to do is use it on my desktop and then publish my site to
a 3rd party server.

If you are an avid Front Page user, then I am not sure that you will be
happy with Xitami.  Xitami is great, but it does not work with the Front
Page features:

1.) It does not support FP extensions such as THEMES.

2.) It can not update the site using the FP usual site update features since
Xitami will not open the site as an HTTP request.  You will have to publish
it locally, and then copy it over manually.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami and WinXP


I just signed up to the list as I need some advice/assistance. Please bear
with me if you have already discussed this.

I use MS FrontPage 98 and MS Personal Web Server on my desktop on a daily
basis to update and test my web site. The site is then published to a 3rd
party web server.

On Thursday I purchased and load Windows XP Home Edition. PWS is not
supported and cannot be loaded. XP Home edition does not have a server
included (the Pro version has IIS 5.0). As I could not use FP98 I had to
uninstall XP!!!

My questions to the group are:
Will Xitami operate with WinXP?
Does Xitami work with FP98?

Again, all I want to do is use it on my desktop and then publish my site to
a 3rd party server.

Cheers,

Robert

[Security]
    webmask=!123.45.67.89,*

will deny requests from the IP 123.45.67.89 then allow from everyone else. 
See <your Xitami docs>/index4.htm#webmask (usually accessible as 
http://127.0.0.1/xitami/index4.htm#webmask while Xitami is running) for 
more details.

Note that, for real security, it may be better to IPban people using a 
firewall (if you do that, anyone connecting to your server from a banned IP 
will usually get no indication that a server even exists at your IP - they 
won't get an error from Xitami, but their computer will generate an error 
when its request times out). If you're doing this to prevent Code Red or 
other virus traffic, this is probably A Good Thing (the more time the virus 
spends waiting for a response which isn't going to arrive, the less time it 
has to flood you or other servers with requests).

Also note that the banned computer will be able to access your server 
through a proxy like their ISP's web proxy or the Google cache or whatever. 
If you're banning a human, this is an issue - if you're banning a 
virus-infected host, this shouldn't be a problem.

I remeber using some webserver in the past that had a built in http
proxy, was it xitami?

Couldn't find any mention in the docs so i guess not.

does xitami support Microsoft Active Server Pages? Can you tell me where to
get them from even if not?

how do I chmod things in Xitami, when I used a script called pw_manager.cgi,
it said Page cannot be displayed, but it didn't say the file was missing cos
its not...

No, it doesn't.

You have to add a mapping in the appropriate CFG file to map the CGI
extension to Perl (or whatever you want to use it for).

Yes....

Her it is, it is rather basic, but it will work. You can modify and give it
a cosmetic facelift.
After sending the file, the file is diplayed. If you don't want this to
happen, modify the .class

No, it's not Xitami.  Apache does have a feature like that if you choose
to compile it in/enable it; it can be quite a useful feature.
