I was just checking my XitamiPro's logs and nothing is being written to any
of them except the xitami.log. I installed XitamiPro per the instructions
(had to create a log directory) . I checked the regular Xitami configs
against the pro's and found no discrepancies.

Does anyone have a clue?

Never mind, I found the problem. I'd rather not publicize my stupidity.

Have you given a value to in each config file?
[Accesslog]
    Filename = "filename.log"

Message-ID: <200302011006.45642.bpaddock@csonline.net>


I have Xitami 2B5 running under both Windows and Linux.

I'm running PHP 4.3.0 on both Windows and Linux.

Simple tests with <?php phpinfo(); ?> works with both.

$_POST['stuff'] returns what I expect when I run my webpages under Windows.

I get nothing at all under Linux from $_POST...   

Can some one point me in the correct direction please?

I have xitami working fine, but I want to create an alias to point to my =
phpadmin and am having trouble.
In the alias definition I have "phpadmin" for the label and "c:\program =
files\phpmyadmin" as the path.
In my default web page setup I have "test.php" as the initial choice and =
"index.php" as the second.
I figured this would work if I entered the url http://127.0.0.1/phpadmin =
but it just pops up a page that says
"no source file" or something like that. So then I went back to my alias =
definition and tacked "index.php"
onto the path and that just brought up a page which showed the actual =
code, not the rendered page.
Can someone tell me what I did wrong?
Thanks

I have this in /etc/php4/php.ini:

register_globals = Off

Is there some thing else I should look at in php.ini?

If it doesn't work under Linux, I can't tell you. That's the correct ini statement .... unless you
have to restart to have it go into effect.

I have this in /etc/php4/php.ini:

register_globals = Off

Is there some thing else I should look at in php.ini?

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami Admin access?
Message-ID: <VA.0000001f.00096b51@datacomm.ch>

I really don't understand why I can't access anymore to the 
admin are form Xitami.

I checked the following files:

default.aut
***********
#  Created at installation time 
#
[/Admin]
    admin="admin"
[Private]
    Jacky=robusta

xitami.aut
**********
..
[/Admin]
    Admin="admin"       #   By default, admin access is 
disabled
#   Admin=LinPopTea
#   Webmask=local       #   <== when 'local', remote access 
is not allowed
..

Why are the possible cause that I can't access to the admin 
page?

Many thanks in advance for your help.

Everyone _please_trim_the_quoted_material_.  It is frustrating enough to
read 100+ lines of quoted material in individual messages, let alone
dealing with dozens of copies of the same thing in a digest.

Good list behaviour says that quoted material should be trimmed to only
a few relevant lines, and almost certainly should not include copies of
copies of copies of... all previous messages.

If necessary I will reduce the size of the messages allowed by the
mailing list even further so that messages with lots of quoting will
automatically be blocked.

You must also have in defaults.cfg just in case the browser based admin is
inactivated in xitami.cfg

[Security]
    admin=1                             #   Allow browser-based admin

You must use webmask=local in defaults.aut for the /admin section otherwise
you will have security problems.

Hello there,

I'm running a Xitami server, but suffering from huge amounts of downloads.
Does anyone know what is the best way to limit the bandwith? Is this
standard possible or do I need additional tools?

Thanks in advance for all help!!

afaik normally no.
The main ability of Xitami compared to another servers is a higher speed.

weird ways - slow down the computer, remove memory, ask isp to reduce
bandwidth, etc.

One normal thing (for any web server) - use robots.txt rules to reduce unwanted
traffic to search engines.

Of course, the high speed is a pro, but when users start downloading at
500+kb/s for days, then I get a bit too much traffic over my network.
So I'm looking for a way to limit bandwith for now. Solutions outside xitami
are welcome as well. I found Nimbus, a free program from Shunra that does
the job but it limits all bandwith, i.e. I cannot distinguish between users
or between up- and download, which is annoying.

I'm running v2.5b5, and it claims to support pipe throttling quite
extensively. However, I haven't tried it.

You are right! I noticed the feature for both ftp and http server;
however it requires a definition in an xml file.
Entering the /admin however, I get "'pipedef.xml' is not readable"
Do you also get this message, or did you add this specific file
yourself?

Thanks in advance,

Kind regards,

- Mark.

I get this same message; I am not suprised as we are running beta versions.
But I bet if you find the definitions for that file you could get at least a
partial solution working.
Or, just wait for the next release, depending on the severity of your
situation.

All the best,
Tom

Is there a way to tell Xitami how much bandwidth to use? It looks like sometimes
the connections on Xitami bring all other applications to a crawl as far as
bandwidth usage goes.

I deleted Xitami and reinstalled it again. Now I can access to 
the Admin area.

Really strange. Because the Default.aut look exactly the same 
look as before!

I added in the Filter section (xitami.cfg) the following line:
[Filter]
.php=d:\php3\php.exe

but the .php pages do not work. 

What are the possible causes?

Many thanks in advance for your help.

Try to put testssi.ssi and testssi.inc in this folder and see what happen.
If it's OK that a problem in the PHP parser differently problem in the

I have found this error in the 2.4d9 version. The server not correctly

[Wsx]
    Admin = ""

I tried to start the page with: 
http://localhost/ateho, but do not work!

This page start when I type http://localhost/,
but I can't get anymore the default page!

If I start with this URL: http://localhost/admin
then the admin page is loaded correctly.

What is the right way to create many web?

My defalut.cfg file look like that:
#*END

[Security]
    Filename = "defaults.aut"

[Server]
    Priority = "1"

[Virtual-hosts]
    * = "ateho.cfg"

Many thanks in advance for your help. 

Regards 

Otto

I looked at it real quick, here's my diagnosis, I may be wrong.
You page uses a frameset, with Index.html being the base frame. All =
other pages load as a subset of Index.html, so the browser always shows =
Index.html as the location, because, well, it is! :-)
I didn't see anything on your page which actually used the capability =
for frames, so you might want to get rid of them and save yourself some =
headaches.

Hi everyone, I am hoping someone can point me in the right direction for
setting up PHP and MYSQL with Xitami Web Server.  I wish to run a
jelsoft forum interface that requires these 2 programs to work.

Thanks in advance

straightforward.

install xitami.
install mysql.
install php.
find php.ini and customize the mysql section accordingly.
run xitami, goto the admin screens, enter a filter like .php pointing to 
/path/to/php.exe.
restart xitami.
run your board setup scripts.

apart from the time needed to download the binaries (which depends on your 
bandwidth) the whole setup will take you no more than 30 minutes.

have fun,
tony

Subject: [Xitami] Setting Up Virtual Hosts
Message-ID: <DGEHJCCICENINLMJDFGPOEGECFAA.Rob@BlueMarbleMeds.com>

Hi,

I have been successfully using Xitami for several months now.  Now I want to
modify the system to run a second website.  I believe that I will have to
begin using "virtual hosts", but after reading the instructions, not quite
clear how to achieve this.  I understand the concept, but lack complete
documentation to move towards this.  Can someone provide me with a brief
summary to which config file sections and syntax to use.

Well when setting up Xitami there are a few useful tips to know.  First a very useful 
feature is Xitami uses a hierarchy system for it's config files.  They would look like 
this:

Xitami.cfg-->defaults.cfg--->All vhost cfg's defined in defaults.cfg (virtual host1, 
virtual host 2, virtual host3)

So a rule defined in Xitami.cfg is overridden by the same rule in defaults.cfg.  
Furthermore a rule in say: vhost1.cfg (one of your vhosts defined in defaults.cfg) 
will override any setting in defaults.cfg .  However keep in mind the rules defined in 
your vhost{xx}.cfg (basically the same as found in xitami.cfg ) only apply to the 
virtual host they reference.  So you can have different vhosts with different rules.

To set up a virtual host is very simple.  In your defaults.cfg you must create a line 
called [Virtual Hosts].  Following this line should be your DNS name connections will 
be coming in on then a "=" then the cfg with the "RULES" for your vhost.

For example in your defaults.cfg it may look like this (note I am catching all 
connections with and without a www.):

[Virtual-Hosts]
www.mydomain.com=vhost1.cfg
mydomain.com=vhost1.cfg
www.myfriendsdomain.com=vhost2.cfg
myfriendsdomain.com=vhost2.cfg


Your vhost{xx}.cfg (or any name you set it) can be set up with rules from Xitami.cfg.  
Make sure you set the different web directories in you vhost{xx}.cfg files.

Example of a vhost{xx}.cfg file:

Filename vhost1.cfg (bellow is what is inside this text file)
[Server]
webpages=c:\xitami\webpages\mywebdirectory
cgi-bin=c:\xitami\cgi-bin


Filename vhost2.cfg (bellow is what is inside this text file)
[Server]
webpages=c:\xitami\webpages\myfriendswebdirectory
cgi-bin=c:\xitami\cgi-bin


Well that is about it.  It's really pretty simple once you got the hang of it.  Hopefully 
did that help or did I shoot over your head? :)

Thank-you so much.

I thought that's how it worked.  I tried exactly that, but when Xitami
"refreshes", when I access the site, the images are gone and I get page
errors.

I just tried this again, but I stopped and started Xitami this time, and
everything seems to work.

Thanks for you guidance.

Many thanks too for your help.

Only a small question. I'm using Xitami only locally to learn PHP. 
Question: how do you start the another web located on separated directory's.
Like: d:\web\ex1\index.htm
      d:\web\ex2\index.htm
      ...
      
I did the following with the help of the "Virtual hosts" template: 


This created a new file called "ex1.cfg" who look like this:
#*END

[Accesslog]
    Filename = "ex1.log"
[Security]
    Filename = "ex1.aut"
[Server]
    Webpages = "d:/web/ex1"
[Wsx]
    Admin = ""

I tried to start the page with: 
http://localhost/ex1, but do not work!

if I start with this URL: http://localhost/admin
then the admin page is loaded correctly.

What is the right way to create many web?

My defalut.cfg file look like that:
#*END
[Security]
    Filename = "defaults.aut"
[Server]
    Priority = "1"
[Virtual-hosts]
    * = "ex1.cfg"

Many thanks in advance for your help. 

Regards 

Otto

Well, you're "computationally challenged" in that you're using
Microsoft's Outlook as a mailer: however, even that allows people to look
at the headers of mails, if they have the will so to do.

If you look at such headers, you'll see that they include:

| List-Help: <mailto:xitami-request@lists.xitami.org?subject=help>
| List-Post: <mailto:xitami@lists.xitami.org>

I would think that this provides the information you seek: otherwise, I
would appear to have misunderstood your question, so perhaps you would
care to rephrase it?

Local access is not what Virtual Hosts are designed for. They require a DNS
resolution, which I doubt you are doing.

To point to different directories, just include it in your http path, I.E.
127.0.0.1/dir1
127.0.0.1/dir2
127.0.0.1/dir3

I'm using Xitami v2.4d9 on NT4 Server, no problem.

"unable" isn't very specific; is there an error message?

Have you been setting NT Permissons in a way that might deny write
permission?

Are you pressing the "save" button on EACH page
until you return to the main WBA screen, and then 
restarting the server? If not, your config setting changes
will not stick.

This was one of the biggest "gotchas" I remember when
getting started with Xitami.

Yep,

save takes me back to the main screen and then I hit restart. I had 
this working on another box already. Also, when I try to ftp to ip 
address (from the box running xitami) I get connection refused.

Nice eh?

So it appears that if I run Xitami as a service I can't make changes 
via the WBA, but if I run the version that will run as Win NT/95, I can 
make changes and save them.

Any speculation?

Not true. My 2.49 Service on NT4 Server works through the Web Config
interface just fine, with a few notes: Save-Save-Save out of
changes, and when in doubt re-start the web server.

It isn't clear why you've gone from bad to worse, but it "should"
work. And so far (knock wood) it does for me.

> I have to change the text files manually.

A thought: do you have the files open in an editor while trying to
change them via web-interface? That may not work (the editor may
have put an exclusive write-lock on the file). X's web-face does not
seem to be smart enough to know when a write fails.

The best way IMNSHO is to simply edit the (text) config file directly and
eliminate any anomalies within the WBA.

Cheers!

I am trying to set up my Xitami server so I can access the webspace
assigned to virtual host from a remote computer over the internet.  I
can't seem to get the settings right in my FTP.
 
I am using Win XP for operating system and FTP.  Is there any Xitami
settings that I am overlooking?
 
Any ideas?  
 
Thanks.

This is not a Xitami question, this is an HTML/PERL/Flash question.  Wrong 
forum.....But, b/c I am such a nice guy I will answer it.  If this doesn't 
answer it completely for you then at least it will get you on the right path 
and you can figure it out by example.

The following is a clip of code out of a cgi script I wrote.  When called it 
simply prints the following HTML to the browser.  The browser then calls the 
Flash functions and loads the Flash image into a normal HTML page.  Though, 
depending on the browser, you could have errors.  I recall it not always 
working properly because of how the CGI calls the script - something about 
where the cgi starts in relation to how the browser calls the Flash 
functions.  Should get you on the right path though.

Would you not simply assemble the HTML page in your CGI program.
So long as the CGI program can 'see' the Flash applet ... I don't see why you can't 
create a HTML page via a CGI program that contains a Flash applet.

You may think that: OTOH, I'm not the one that has trouble with
communication, since I have no difficulties in reading the headers which
are present on every single posting to this list.

If someone asks a stupid question, to which he already has the answer
available, then he deserves re-education.  Pointing out that useful
information is to be found in the headers of mail messages is the
Internet equivalent of the old adage about teaching a man to fish; it's
potentially far more useful to the original enquirer than merely telling
him the information he sought.

> I would suspect your attitude too ...

Yours too seems more than a little suspect.

I'd better introduce myself first.  My name is Stuart and I work in a drop-in centre where I have won the job of 
installing and maintaining the LAN.  We're going for Internet connection soon but meanwhile I'd like us to have 
a local web server.  I found Xitami and tried it and like it. But there's a little problem.

I've installed it on a machine running Windows XP Pro.  It works fine when anyone's logged in but when there's 
no-one logged in Xitami isn't working and none of the other computers can access the server. I've read the 
FAQs and XP's help files but can not find how to install Xitami to run as a service.  Can anyone help, please?

Stuart

Install the Service version.

It is usually that easy: the Installer asks you and you tell it to
Install As Service. But sometimes you have to do it manually, which
means going into the Dark Place (DOS or CMD window). As a LAN-man,
you need to do this sometimes.

In a Command Prompt window, CD to the Xitami folder, then find the
Xitami EXE file. Mine seems to be called "xiwinnt.exe" Type its name
with -h after it to see all command options, or with -i to Install
as Service. (You will need Admin-level rights to install a service).

> xiwinnt -h
Xitami web server v2.4d9 (c) 1991-99 iMatix
read the file COPYING for details.  Type xiwinnt -h for help.

Xitami web server: Windows service model
Syntax: xiwinnt [options...]
Options:
  -i               Install Windows service
  -u               Uninstall Windows service
  -d               Run Xitami as DOS console program
  -r directory     Root directory for web pages (webpages).
  -c directory     Directory for CGI programs (cgi-bin).
  -f directory     Root directory for FTP files (webpages).
  -b portbase      Shift HTTP port 80 by this value.  E.g. to run
                   Xitami on port 5080, do 'xitami -b 5000'.
  -l filename      Log file for output (xitami.log).
  -a filename      Authorisation file (xitami.aut).
  -q               Quite mode: no messages or log.

I've got an outside router (which I control) and a range of public IP addresses (My lan is 
further inside behind a NAT firewall)

I'm setting up an Xitami v2.4d6 server on one of my public IP addresses.

With the following settings:

	IP port base: 0
	Port for FTP connections: 21
	Maximum FTP connections: 4
	Data connection port: 200
	Passive IP address:All addresses

And with no other servers running on this computer.

Am I right in assuming that that:

	HTTP only needs port 80
and

	FTP only needs ports 21, 200, 201, 202 and 203

to pass thru my outside router so that these services are publicly available.

Also is this true for both passive and normal FTP

Thanks in anticipation

Sounds like you need the Service version of Xitami.  Service are just 
programs that load even if you haven't logged in yet.  Just download and 
install the service while logged in as an adminstrator. It should all be 
thesame are your other versions, just that you don't have Xitami icon in 
the corner anymore. Heck you can even use the same config files from 
your past install.

Stuart,

You have to download a different version from the website.  I believe that 
proper file would be titled as "Win NT Service".  Just go ahead and install as 
you did with your other version.

Quick question.  I have Xitami and Active Perl for Windows running on a NT system

speeding up of processing perl tasks under Xitami or may help?

Thanks for any advice. :)  Gene Angel

The only thing I could recommend is running Xitami as a high priority 
service (in the Xitami configs).  Then making the "cgi" or perl scripts have 
high priority - but thats not done through Xitami, that would be done at the 
system level.  Though I don't know how much it would buy you.

Subject: [Xitami] missing .aut files
Message-ID: <000301c2d3a1$6ba731f0$0500a8c0@gabriel>

Yesterday I deleted an .AUT file, thinking it wasn't in use by any of the
virtual hosts. Then a while later, I found Xitami (running as an NT service)
dead. I tried restarting it, it would start, and then die right away. I had also
edited the configuration files prior to this so I thought I did something wrong
in the configuration files, and it caused some sort of crash. Well, it turnes
out the .AUT file I deleted *was* needed by a virtual host, and since Xitami
couldn't find it, it quit after initializing.

The "xiwinnt.exe -d" command (runs Xitami as a console app as opposed to a
service) saved my day. =) I'm posting this because it took me some time to find
out what was wrong. I'm hoping if it happens to somebody else, this post might
be
useful.

Also, if Xitami wrote an error event to the Event Log about errors like this
one,
life would be much easier, methinks.

Your port mappings on your firewall need to map to where your FTP 
server is running. ie: if 192.168.1.15 is where your FTP server is 
running then port 21 must be mapped there.

Message-ID: <F192dnjQ8vjqueolj8J000134d8@hotmail.com>

Hi all,
Wonder if you can help me with a small local file handling snafuu here;
Darn (1)'s on the end of file names...

Run Xitami here on my desktop .. WWW access it from my couch potato  Laptop. 
  Both are at home, local networked to a DSL modem with a little 4port 
router.  Desktop/Notebook are Not file sharing networked, I simply let the 
laptop access server via IEplorers http://ods.org/

With the laptop from home, whenever I access the http server with IE to play 
a tune or move a file, the files are getting a (1) added at the end of the 
filenames coming to the laptop.
ie;   songname.mp3(1)   progname.zip(1)  etc...

Makes it difficult to play that mp3 or open that zip without doing a save as 
and erasing the darn (1)...  and mp3(1) isn't an associated file.ext so it 
won't just click and autolaunch MediaPlayer either.

Suggestions, Ideas as to why -  appreciated.

I'm not entirely sure but this could be an Internet Explorer problem at the
client side. I'm making this guess based on the fact that my IE (under WinXP)
saves files in the cache as filename[1].ext . But obviously your problem could
be something totally different. What OS and IE version are you using on your
laptop?

After years of running Xitami on a Win98 machine, I moved it over to an XP machine.

It was running fine except that once a day, it crashed on it's own. I check all logs and found
absolutely nothing to indicate why it was doing that.

Well, I decided to run the "Program Compatibility Wizard" and made it Windows 98 compatible.  Guess
what?  It doesn't crash anymore!

Just thought I'd pass that along.

Hi all,

I have read all of the doco on vhosts and cgi-bins, etc but haven't been
able to find out if the following is possible.
Basically I want to run almost my entire website via cgi, (I am using
quixote) but some stuff like images can still get served as normal.  So
does anyone know if it is possible to set xitami up so that:
http://www.myhost.com/images

refers to the images directory in the webpages directory (or whereever
else I set it) but
http://www.myhost.com/

directs everything to my quixote script?

Regards, Simon Cusack.

I'm running Xitami 2.4d9 on Windows XP Home.  I don't
think that matters, though, I think its that I'm
running Java 1.41.  I couldn't get Sokrates to run out
of the box as I had once before, I believe on Windows
2k with Java 1.3.  The runner.cmd batch file has a
line that begins by trying to invoke "jre".  jre is an
unrecognized command under Java 1.41.  See the docs
at:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/tooldocs/tools.html

Editing runner.cmd, and substituting "java" for "jre"
did the trick though.

HTH, and am directly copying the Sokrates author.

I'm using Xitami Pro and will probably NEVER use Apache for anything. But that's not the point of
this post. I use PHP 4.3.1 (current) with Xitami flawlessly. I have register globals=off.

For weeks I've been trying to find a webmail script that will work with that configuration and my
mailserver of Mercury. I had previously found Squirrelmail and it wouldn't work, or so I thought.
After exhausting other efforts, I returned to it and started examining the source scripts. Lo and
behold, I found that the header("Locations ... function they had in the files was a relative URI.
HTTP/1.1 spec requires a full URI.

I have no problem using the 1.0 spec, but I don't know how! So, I changed all the header commands to
a full URL.

Does anyone have any idea where and if I can change to the HTTP/1.0. specification? Also, since I
use SSL on one subdomain, doesn't SSL require the 1.1 specification?

Thanks in advance!

hi,

afaik things go like this:

>I have no problem using the 1.0 spec, but I don't know how! So, I changed 
>all the header commands to

That's the correct thing to do. It's up to the client and not up to the 
server to suggest the protocol version to use. They both agree on the 
latest protocol they both understand if not (_both_) are setup to do different.
HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616) requires a full URI for redirection. If a redirect 
occurs, the client receives a HTTP status response of 302 (Found) instead 
of the usual 200 (OK). Check your Webserver-Logs to see that.

BTW, even HTTP/1.0 (RFC 1945) already required a full URI for the Location 
field too.

So, by definition of RFC 2616, a compliant client receives 302, and checks 
the location field for an absolute URI. A client _can_ additionally 
implement detection of relative URIs, but the info provider (you) cannot 
rely on it.

>Does anyone have any idea where and if I can change to the HTTP/1.0. 
>specification? Also, since I

For test purposes you can try to fetch a redirecting resource on the 
command line via Telnet and GET / HTTP/1.0 or try to find a very old 
browser for testing.

I was wondering myself why a lot of php scripts found on the net make use 
of relative URIs in the location header-field, despite the respective 
specifications. Didn't really figure out, but came to think that earlier 
php-versions probably _translated_ relative URIs to absolute URIs before 
returning them to the client. Newer versions (of php) maybe don't do it 
anymore to give more transparency to the redirection process.

Concerning the SSL question, I think SSL doesn't have anything to do with 
HTTP. SSL is not "layered" upon HTTP but very low level on tcp/ip.

Hope this helps.
tony

I have been trying to get phpadsnew to work on my Xitami server and I
can't get it to read a few scripts.  I posted a question on the
phpadsnew forum board and they seem to think that the problem lies with
Xitami and it's ability to read the scripts.
 
Has anyone else tried phpadsnew and successfully got it to run?  The
problem that I am finding is with the file 'settings-index.php'.
 
I am running Windows XP SP1, Xitami 2.5b5, PHP 4.3.0, and MySql 3.23.55.
The version of phpadsnew that I am trying to setup is rc2.
 
Thanks.
Howard

Xitami ain't reading any script. It passses the request from the client to 
php and returns the answer from php to the client. It doesn't give anything 
about what is being returned from the script-running program php.

The problem with your settings-index.php is the relative URI, a problem we 
discussed here earlier this day. Change it to an absolute URI and it'll work.

I come to think, that maybe apache is correcting the 
non-specification-conformant HTTP-header field returned by php. Does anyone 
know about this aspect of the guts of apache? Would be interesting.

Hope this helps,
tony

Hello !

I can't figure out precisely what your problem is.
I'm using Mercury as relay mailserver and had never a problem.
To send mail much faster, i use the mail drop facility instead of creating 
a smtp connection:
format a message, name it xxx.101, put it in the QUEUE directory and 
Mercury takes care of all the rest. The program to do that is very simple 
compared to a complete smtp session where you have to check every MX 
response message.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20030224091228.00a42ec0@verfaillie4.verfaillie.local>

Hello !

For those interested in using CGI, there is a little informative site located

<http://web.verfaillie.be?webserver> or <http://web.verfaillie.com/webserver>

(both url point to the same server, but using different connections: cable 
versus adsl)

It is mostly basic stuff for those who never used CGI, but want to give it 
a try.
All the examples are in Powerbasic <http://www.powerbasic.com> but can 
easily be modified to Liberty Basic, Visual basic and so on.

Some topics:
* a basic "hello world" program
* configuring Xitami
* writing fast programs as back end
* talking to the user: escaping the input and html-coding the output
* files and security considerations
* some working examples: a guestbook

All comments appreciated to make this site more informative !

Okay, here we go:

The default data-port for Xitami's FTP server is 200.

I am told that it should not use a well known port and that it causes 
problems with firewalls and that a value over 49151 is preferred.

Any comments?...

Hello with all
I am new on this list and French (I use Altavista for the translation) I

Subject: [Xitami] Used port 80
Message-ID: <3E5EC1F3.5020506@swbell.net>

Sometimes when I start my system, Xitami won't start correctly.  An 
error message appears and says that something else is using port 80.  I 
have tried to disable anything I think is accessing the internet during 
startup.  And then I try to restart Xitami, but it will still say port 
80 is being used.  I have to restart the computer, and then Xitami 
starts with no problem.  I suspect that whatever was using the port, 
Xitami grabs the port before the other application can and then the 
other application has to find another port.  Is there any way I can tell 
what might be using port 80?  Thanks.

Message-ID: <3E5E91E6.13670.90DB30@localhost>

I still use Xitami for Windows.  But I use Web/2 now.  Stability of 
OS/2 Xitami failed when my web server started (other's 
experiences may vary).  However I did use PHP with Xitami for 
OS/2 for a long time with no problems.  Unfortunately there is no 
easy OS/2 PHP setup page. I will give you my setup.  Hope it 
helps. :)

First download the latest copy of PHP.  You can get it here: 
http://silk.apana.org.au/php/download/php-4.2.3-os2-exe.zip
Note: The whole package is contained in the PHP.EXE .  That was 
convenient for me as I placed it on a ram disk for extra speed.  But 
this is not necessary.

On the same drive as your OS/2 in your x:\MPTN\ETC directory 
create a php.ini file.

For me I used a php.ini from a windows distribution.  You will want 
to modify the [mail function] I spent months trying to figure this one 
out.

Here are my settings:

[mail function]
SMTP = smpt.yourmailserver.net
sendmail_from = your@email.org
sendmail_path = "sendmail -t -i -F Your-Name-No-Spaces -f 
your@email.org"

I feel it is important to note.  You will have to configure sendmail in 
your OS/2 TCP/IP settings to use your SMTP server.  However.. 
DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT enable SENDMAIL to run on start-up.  
Unless you know what you are doing sendmail will function as a 
open mail relay.  I've never done it myself but I know people who 
learned the hard way.  So remember DO NOT enable sendmail.exe 
to load on start-up.

Now you need to configure your Xitami CFG files.  Bellow are 
mine.  You can modify yours to match your configuration.

These settings are in my defaults.cfg file:

[Server]
default1-index.html
default2=index.htm
default3=index.php
default4=index.php3                  #   Any number of default pages
default5=default.htm                #      called 'default<n>'

[Filter]
.php=e:\php4\php.exe
.php3=e:\php4\php.exe
.phtml=e:\php4\php.exe

[Mime]

    #  Video MIME types
    avi=video/msvideo
    wmv=video/msvideo
    mov=video/quicktime
    movie=video/x-sgi-movie
    mpe=video/mpeg
    mpeg=video/mpeg
    mpg=video/mpeg
    qt=video/quicktime

    #  Audio MIME types
    aif=audio/x-aiff
    aifc=audio/x-aiff
    aiff=audio/x-aiff
    au=audio/basic
    snd=audio/basic
    wav=audio/wav
    mid=audio/midi
    rmi=audio/midi
    ram=audio/x-pn-realaudio
    rpm=audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin
    ra=audio/x-realaudio
    rm=audio/x-pn-realaudio
    mp3=audio/mpeg
    m3u=audio/mpegurl
    mp3url=audio/mpegurl

Php=application/x-httpd-php
Php3=application/x-httpd-php
Phtml=application/x-httpd-php


That should be a good start.  Good luck on your setup!

It's late. To complete the sentences I left incomplete:  I still use 
Xitami for Windows.  But I use Web/2 for OS/2 on that platform.  
Stability of OS/2 Xitami failed for me when my web server started 
getting heavy constant hits (other's  experiences may vary).

Oh that guy may be French but there are plenty of online 
translation services open for those who know how to use them.

Only one sentence in French and already an error.

Hmm, in the first line you say "when I start my system", but later say "I
have to restart the computer".  So presumably this error is NOT when you
FIRST start your computer?

Could it be that you've had Xitami running already (and binding to port
80) and that, for some reason that you don't specify, it's been stopped
(either deliberately or accidentally), and that this is why you're
[re]starting Xitami?  I know that under some failure modes, if a process
has had a port listening, and that process dies, it can be that the
TCP/IP stack itself keeps the port noted down as being "in use".  Could
this be the case for you?

Eventually, given enough time, the stack may release the number for
reuse; I used to find with the old TCP/IP stack under OS/2 that this took
about fifteen minutes, although the new one implements additional ioctl
bits that allow one to specify that this shouldn't happen, so with TCP/IP
v4.3 it no longer happens.  As you have discovered, a reboot will always
clear this sort of problem, but is probably somewhat drastic!

I know that for a long time the TCP/IP stack of Windows was based upon an
ancient BSD implementation, although I also know that it's been improved
considerably over the past few years.  OTOH, were this a common
occurrence, I would have expected to see more postings to this list about
such a problem.

(Incidentally, I'm assuming throughout that the error exception that's
being thrown is EADDRINUSE.)

Hello everyone,

I have been running Xitami at work connected to the internet via a DSL 
circuit. We have receintly installed a T-1. I have pointed the gateway 
IP address of the Xitami computer to the new T-1 circuit.

 From home (or anywhere else) when I type in the IP address of the dsl 
circuit within my web browser, Xitami surves up my web page. When I type 
in the IP address of the new T-1 circuit, I get a time-out error.

The people who installed the T-1 circuit is telling me I need to assign 
a public IP address to my Xitami web server to make it work. I have 
always used a private address (192.168.0.xx) and it has worked for over 
a year.

What do I need to do to get Xitami to serve the IP address of the new 
circuit? I'm thinking that maybe they have a filter or something 
preventing port 80 from working...

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Kelly
