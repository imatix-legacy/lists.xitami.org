Did you also try:

  http://server_url/cgi-bin/file_name.ext    ?

Sorry if the answer is self-evident.

 I'm sorry.. Thats what I meant 
 http://localhost/cgi-bin/load1.dll

  where the mapped cgi-bin directory is
  c:/xitami/cgi-bin  [ which isn't created on install ]

  putting the dlls and exe's in other locations hasn't

Try the attached file I'm sending separately from the list.
Put it inside c:/xitami/cgi-bin and then call it
with the browser http://localhost/cgi-bin/hello.bat  and see if it works.

If the simple hello.bat which has just this one line in it:

     @echo Hello!

outputs "Hello!", then your problem will have nothing to do with 
Xitami's cgi-bin configuration.

 Thanks. File received, loaded and run succussfully.
 So I guess the issue isn't the mapping but some other setting.
 I attempted to run my dll [ which is uspposed to call the exe ]. MZLOAD1.dll and I receive a windows warning 'You area attempting to open a file of type "Application Extension" dll 'and suggests that running a file of this type may be harmful etc. Its as if its trying to download the dll instaed of running it the same way IIS used to.

Older builds shipped with a simple CGI executable (printed
environment values) in that folder. In today's internet, exposing
your environment to strangers is a Poor Idea, so it was taken out of
recent builds. The packaging tool wasn't told to pack empty folders,
so omitted it. An oversight, but easily fixed as you did. And
perhaps forcing you to create your own CGI-BIN is the better idea,
so you can't have CGI without thinking first.

IIS (and PWS) may be unique in using DLL files as directly
executable programs. This supports MS's hidden agenda: sell MS
compilers and other programming tools, and make it difficult to
switch off of IIS to another server if you have done any custom
programming.

Can you open a CMD window (Start, Run, "cmd", Enter) and run a .DLL
file? I'm too scared to even try that, since I don't know what any
of my DLL files do. If you can't run a DLL from a command prompt,
then you may not be able to run it as CGI under Xitami. Maybe it
would work if the DLL file were rebuilt as an EXE file.

> my dll ...is uspposed to call the exe

Does the DLL actually do anything, or is it just there to trick IIS
into running the EXE (something it may not do naturally)? If the DLL
is just a starting-stub, try calling the EXE directly.

I'm no fan of IIS, but it appears as an installable option on the
XP-Pro that I have here. You can find XP-Pro in an OEM package for
only $90 more than XP-home.

PWS (Personal Web Server) is IIS-Lite, was a free download, and
supports much of IIS's peculiar CGI interface including using DLLs
as CGI executables. I don't know if it is available for XP (it may
not matter: the same PWS ran on 9x and NT4 so it may be agnostic).
Or it may be listed in your XP-Home "Add Software"?

You may find that Apache has something someone has written to run
IIS-style DLL CGI. Apache is good, and free, and the current version
will run right out of the box without tedious INI-file hacking. You
may need a little INI editing to run CGI or DLL-CGI, and Apache does
not have the cool web-interface for that.

CGI runs executable files -- not DLLs. DLLs are not directly
executable. As the name infers, they are Dynamic Link
Libraries that are used by applications.

Your DLL is likely an
ISAPI DLL designed to work with IIS. This has some performance
benefits since the DLL is loaded once by the IIS exe into
its memory space, whereas CGI exes must run-execute-close
each time they are needed.


Further, a CGI exe must
conform to the input/output requirements of CGI.
Try calling your exe directly.

 As you pointed out, only exe's get run, but the key to getting IIS to accept an exe is a little 16k dll that acts as a 'thunking' layer. The dll is named the same as its larger exe brother..call the dll in the script and the exe is run, which in turn returns the page. I realize now that this applies only for IIS. I had used o'Reilly in the distant past [ and may have to use it again ??] and it recognized the the .exe extension. Xitami appears to make a leap of faith that this is a script [ given the cg-bin in the tag ]

 What I've tried is to NOT use the dll extension and call the exe directly..but use just the file name instead. cgi-bin/MZload1 with no file extension. I get a blank page returned. Look on the bright side at least it found something this time out, and judging by the brief delay it looks as if something is being run.

Have you tried the ISAPI Beta Add-on to Xitami with LRWP and your DLLs?
This is probably the only route that you can take at this point to get them
to work.

Hope this helps!

I'd still give the ISAPI Add-On a shot.  Also use Task Manager (assuming
you run WinNT/2000/XP) to see if that shows the executable launching and
stopping (even if it is only for a short bit...may require reloading
several times in the browser).

Hope this helps!

Code Red/ Code Red 2 worm is trying to exploit a hole in IIS. So the machine
at 12.225.139.174 is infected, and is trying to infect you. Since you are
not running IIS, this should not be a problem. Everybody gets these. If
you're running Windows, make sure that everything is patched.
The requests will show up as errors in your error log.

Hi:

I=B4m trying the XiFusion module, and it seems to work fine along with =
Coldfusion.

My questions are:

Does anybody use Coldfusion/Xifusion with Xitami?

and most important:

How about security issues?

I had to allow many instances through my Firewall to get it runing and =
I=B4m a little worry about that.

Thanks:

Carlos

dammit, my eyes are too weak to read your logs, especially in
double-wrap-quote shape, and with not enough coffee in me yet.

I suppose you see some "200" responses. The requested URL is
illegal. On IIS, that tricks IIS into doing something it should not
do. But Xitami knows it is illegal and truncates the URL at the
illegal encoding, figuring it must be a mis-typing. The remaining
URL points to your Home Page, which Xitami sends back and logs as
happiness. That isn't the response the worm was hoping for, too bad.

Yes, that would be the problem. You must have both records point to your
Xitami machine. Unless of course you HAVE two IP's at the one machine.
(Which is another round of headaches.)
I use Jsoft's Simple DNS to do my own DNS hosting. Not for the faint of
heart, but one heckuva lot easier than BIND. I have 7 domain names all
pointing to a single IP, where Xitami sits and pours out web pages
respective to the requests.
DISCLAIMER: I recently tried to run Xitami 2.5b5 and could not get it to
function with virtual hosts! I had to drop back to 2.4d9.

Of course not. DNS is for machine-names, not sub-folders.

In DNS:
 sorcep.com -> sorcep.com
 drewhoo.com -> sorcep.com

DNS gets them to your machine. Then you tell XITAMI:

"If they ask for sorcep.com, give them (webpages)/"
"If they ask for drewhoo.com, give them (webpages)/drewhoo"
"If they don't say what they want, give them (webpages)/"

(That last case will happen with version 1 browsers, or if someone
types an IP number instead of a host-name. You can set IP numbered
V-hosts but it is rarely worth the trouble.)

Go into XITAMI's main Administration page, click "Virtual hosts".
Click "New".

Create virtual host profile:  [ drewhoo ]
Select IP address: [ (all) ]
Or, enter DNS host name:  [ drewhoo.com ]
Web page root directory:  drewhoo
Create directories if necessary?  [ ] (not checked)
Click "Create"

Since you already have the pages, I told you to NOT "Create
directories" so if you get the syntax wrong, Xitami will complain
and let you guess again.

The way you are set up now, (webpages)/drewhoo/ will pull up a
directory listing, unless you have an index.html in there. You
probably want to rename Drewhoo.html to index.html, so it will pop
up when drewhoo.com/ opens (webpages)/drewhoo/

Oh... and after creating a new V-host, stop and re-start Xitami.
That "should" not be needed, but often is.

You need to download the NT service version.

Mine does, I am running Win XP, and it is running as a service.  However the
downfall to xitami is..
The security is fine, but on upload download it does not provide resume or
multi link.
Personnally I run Apache 2.0.4.5 in addition and it also is as a service,
but I run it at a different port.
That gives the upload download resume, plus the multiple link for getright
etc.etc.
Bit of a problem setting it up, but it does work just fine...

Boy Howdy there cowboy. You got that right.

About Xitami, download the 'service' version. Works great. Much easier ... yet powerful like Apache.

Those requests to go through the firewall should have all been 'localhost'.
 This is interesting since CF uses named pipes by default and decided to
use sockets instead for some reason or perhaps the firewall software on the
machine also blocks requests for named pipes?

If you want, IMO, a better alternative to CF, I recommend checking out
Nuclear Vision:

http://12.210.108.203:83/search.nvm?searchname=Nuclear+Vision+Documentation


As to security issues, the only major security issue I know of is just that
enabling any sort of CGI-style application for dynamic content opens a
whole new can of worms that ensures job security for system administrators :)

Hope this helps!

That's no worm...those are script kiddies attempting to upload and hook
patched DLLs into compromised IIS servers...most likely for zombie attacks
as well as more refined control of the systems.  There are real people
behind those.  I've also seen various systems trying to deliberately
propagate CodeRed/CodeRed II (mostly Linux boxes...).

Hope this helps!

We were getting corruptions on download of our setup.exe
The new box is in, formatted, new NT 4 Workstation sp6a, and locked down
Xitami is on it and running...
So far, we are not getting CRC errors

Would any (windoze) users be willing to download and attempt to install the software and report if they get a CRC error ?

We're running 3/4 T1 up-down on cable modem. 
We're out in the boonies and just so happen to have a fiber optic running up and down the highway not far from our place.

We think the hi-speed users were having the problem, but have not had negative feedback.

It's not Code Red....

Code Red Version 2 :
/default.ida?XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u9090%u8190%u00c3%u0003%u8b00%u531b%u53ff%u0078%u0000%u00=a%20 
HTTP/1.0" 404 -1 "" ""

(Version I use many "N")

Code Red V2 installs a backdoor (copy cmd.exe into the CGI-Directory of 
the server and rename it to root.exe). You can run all commands on an 
infected Server.

This here :
217.83.192.168 - - [25/May/2003:03:06:42 +0100] "GET 
/scripts/..%c1%1c../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+dir HTTP/1.0" 404 -1 ""

is a "script Kiddie" trying to find an infected server.

 >If you're running Windows, make sure that everything is patched.
a) You need only a Code Red patch if you use IIS (but Xitami is not 
affected)
b) An unpatched Linux system is equal to an unpatched Windows system

Average download speed of 23.7 K/s
normally 25-26 K/s
using ADSL 256 line
server does NOT support resuming
using Getright for download
approximate 8-10 minute download
does not support multi link.
file downloaded :  CoursePlayerInstaller_51725.exe
No corruption in download
Location download for me:  Mexico

Note...
If you were to install Apache, then put only your download section under
Apache,
That would change your download:  access to resuming, and multi links.
When using a download accelaerator, it verifies the download while putting
the thing back together..
To access the other download page from Xitami, is really quite simple,  just
access as if it was an extension form your own page, but at a different
port.
i.e.
http://www.yourpage.com/  is to your page under xitami   however
http://www.yourpage.com:8080/ is to the apache server setup for port 8080
and to handle all downloads,
then when done comes back to the main page....?
or however you have it set up...
I WISH xitami could handle those two things...
Other than that Xitami is perfect...

Has anyone successfuly loaded Ioncube with Xitami on Windows and php ver

Can't be of any help on Ioncube, don't even know what it is, but I installed
Xitami on a box the other day for a replacement of and Omni box for our
Calendar Scheduling App. Installed PHP, believe it was 4.3.1, no special
problems incountered. During the install need to select the advanced install
type to id Xitami as the server and choose both .php and .php3, if you need
backward compat, I usually add it just in case. Other than that, configuring
is all that should be necessary. I used Xitami's Web Admin capability for
this. Just use the user/password you gave it during the install. When the
page comes up go to the Configuration page and use the MIME link in the
upper right corner. You need to enter 'php' in the first field and
'application/x-httpd-php' in the second. No quotes of course. Hit save. Hit
Configuration again, Find the filters link and hit it. The extensions should
be listed with 'C:\php\php.exe' listed as the filter command. Down lower on
this page you may want to change the default page listings. Hit save back to
the config page. Find and hit the security link. Hit the Define Button, it's
under the Password File section. The admin link should show your
user/password combo you added during the install. The private link will show
a dummy record that Xitami adds during install, change it to what you want
to use. Hit save three times to get back to the Admin page. Hit Restart and
wait a second or two. Then close the browser, your done. After this I tested
the Php install be using a phpinfo script and ran it to see if all was well.
It was so I went on and installed our calendar and it functioned just fine.
In the process of making an image now.

Subject: [Xitami] Virtual Host?
Message-ID: <3EE99AE6.9589.235D96@localhost>

Hello all,

I have [one IP address] but, I have several [Domain names]
How do I setup Xitami so that if a user types in

something.com he/she is directed to pages in something.com
on the other hand, if ( anotherdomain.net ) is used they are 
directed to pages for that Domain name....

Thanks....

I use Simple DNS Plus, it's easy to use. Makes setting up and maintaining
your DNS settings easy.

Message-ID: <3EE9ABAC.32158.64E4FA@localhost>

I scanned Xitami versions 2.4.* and 2.5.* and both contain (Cain 1.5)
trojan. Has anyone else recognised this?\

Perhaps it could be something else on my machine but all looks fine.

What are you using to scan, I use Norton AV and it hasn't detected anything
unless it just cleaned it and went on?

TDS-3 and Anti-Trojan 5.5
Norton AV doesn't do a very good job detecting Trojans, only Viri.
Another anomoly about Norton is that it make programs like
Database's crawl.

As Cain is a /client/, connecting to the Abel /server/, it makes no 
sense for Xitami to be infected with it. You are most likely 
experiencing false positives.

Haven't noticed any slowdown with NAV but I run my scans after hours. I when
ahead and download AT 5.5 trial to see if it can find something. I also run
Swat IT and Ad-aware. Dosn't hurt to have something else I guess just to be
on the safe side.

As I just told someone else:

Go into XITAMI's main Administration page, click "Virtual hosts".
Click "New".

Create virtual host profile:  [ drewhoo ]
Select IP address: [ (all) ]
Or, enter DNS host name:  [ drewhoo.com ]
Web page root directory:  drewhoo
Create directories if necessary?  [ ] (not checked)
Click "Create"

Since you already have the pages, I told you to NOT "Create
directories" so if you get the syntax wrong, Xitami will complain
and let you guess again.

The way you are set up now, (webpages)/drewhoo/ will pull up a
directory listing, unless you have an index.html in there. You
probably want to rename Drewhoo.html to index.html, so it will pop
up when drewhoo.com/ opens (webpages)/drewhoo/

 -PRR

Anti-Trojan didn't find anything in Xitami but it did find something in a
different file on my computer.
SQL.Worm.Snake which it removed.

Paul,

I have setup virtual-host names

Select a configuration:
                               Name:
                           Last modified:
                            Size, lines:
                                  
defaults 
2003-06-13
14:23
21

homeftp 
2003-06-13
11:11
27

homeip 
2003-06-13
11:12
14


my defaults.cfg file has this:

[Virtual-hosts]
    dnsname.homeftp.net=homeftp.cfg
    dnsname.homeip.net=homeip.cfg

(where dnsname above is masked for this message.)

I also have homeftp.aut & .cfg as well as homeip.aut & .cfg
(these are located in my Xitami directory.

I have created :/xitami/homeftp & :/xitami/homeip directories,

both of these directories contain different index.htm files for testing.
I can only view the contents of homeip even if I type into my browser
both of the DNS Names....

perhaps you could help explain why....

Euman

Subject: [Xitami] Virtual Host...
Message-ID: <000e01c33510$c67dd4f0$5416e60c@one>

Hello,

I'm new to the list, so I'm jumping right in with a question for the group.

I have setup a virtual host through Xitami's WBA setup.  It seemed
relatively simple and when the process was complete I ended up with some
directories that corresponded with the virtual host name that I used.
However, I am at a loss as to how I am suppose to be able to access the
webpages and cgi files for this virtual host through a web browser.  I don't
know what I am suppose to use for a url.

My setup is a personal computer at home.  I am using Xitami to serve a make
believe online business web so that I can test cgi's that I have written. I
like to be as organized as possible, hence the reason for creating the
virtual host.  I want my project to have its own cgi-bin, webpages, etc
directories.  My Internet connection is through a cable modem, so the url
that I use to access the Xitami web server is through that IP address as
well as an internal address, 127.0.0.1.

I hope that I am making sense to someone out there.  If anyone can point me
in the right direction for setting up and accessing a virtual host via a web
browser, I would greatly appreciate the input.

Thanks
Bill

Bill,

The best (fastest) way to test out your websites, cgi, etc. is locally
(127.0.0.1).  However, your virtual host must be setup for that address
(127.0.0.1).  If you have no virtual host pointing explicitly to 127.0.0.1,
Xitami will default to either the default or baseline (if there is one)
virtual hosts when you try to browse 127.0.0.1 (http://localhost resolves to
127.0.0.1 by the way, they are interchangeable).

Now suppose you get that working but you want to test it from the "outside".
You would need to setup another virtual host that corresponds with your
cable IP address (or a domain name pointing to that address, if you have
one).  Or again, Xitami will use it's default/baseline settings because it
won't find a virtual host corresponding to the IP you are trying to browse.

I hope this makes some sense!
-Ross

Thanks Ross,

What you said makes absolute sense.  I was looking through my defaults.cfg
file and I found a line that said...

*=virtualhost.cfg

However, that asterisk wasn't letting me access the virtualhost web until I
physically changed it to 127.0.0.1.  I don't know why the * wasn't working
except that that was how the xitami.cfg file was set up with ip addresses.
That file had a line in it that said...

*=ipaddress

Anyway, I got it working the way that I wanted to.  I can even access my
server using my Internet ip address, too.  Now I can get back to work. :)

Bill

Have the latest Xitami installed on a W2K workstation (SP2). The applet accessed
via system tray often locks up. The window will pop up, but sometimes show up
blank. Can't move it or close it. Or it appears normally but goes blank and
freezes when I try to access one of the options (like Setup). When this occurs,
the applet can only be terminated with the Task Manager. In all other respects -
even when the applet freezes, the web server works fine.

Any ideas?

hi,

does anyone know if SMT HTTP client(not server) source

if I need to modify the source code, do I need the
original .l file so I can change it in Libero?

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20030625195247.009e5450@mail.verfaillie.com>

Hello !

Does anybody know how to open non-standard ports for web (client side)?
Webmail is already on port 80.

The internet explorer that ships with w98 and w2k allows the use of 
non-standard ports.
IE 6.0 does not allow the use of this port, and i can't use any port above 
1024 because my isp only allows standard ports.

Is there some registry-trick to force the latest IE version to use 
non-standard ports?

I'm not sure what your problem is exactly or what you are trying to
accomplish, but I have IE 6.0 with all security patches applied under
Windows XP Professional and have no problem connecting to any port (< 1024
or otherwise).  This really doesn't seem like a request that should be here
unless you are trying to put Xitami on another port besides 80...in which
case I would suggest making sure Xitami has started properly and isn't
complaining in the log files about not being able to start on the port
number you specify...make sure you counter whatever you add to the HTTP
port with an equivalent decrement to the FTP port or you won't be able to
FTP on port 21.

Hope this helps!

Hello

I have no problem connecting to my server running on any port using windows 
98 with its supplied Internet explorer.
The server is running fine for years now. Our corporate ISP only allows for 
10 MB of webspace, so i place some material on our local server.
The standard port 80 is already in use and i have to use an alternate port. 
119 is available.
However, more and more customers are switching to XP or upgrading their web 
client, and they can't access our server anymore. (The redirection is done 
at our ISP, so users don't have to type port numbers).
More comments inside your mail.

Marc

Port 119 is a port for news servers.  My guess is that HINTERNET (the
specific API IE uses for retrieving data from the web) sees port 119 and
attempts to connect as a news browser instead of HTTP (or refuses the
connection altogether since it usually doesn't understand the news protocol
- there are also mapping files on the hard drive that may be affecting
this).  My suggestions to you are:

1)  Check your firewall settings and maybe temporarily drop the firewall
altogether to see if it is a firewall issue and not a browser issue.
2)  Change to another port and have your ISP forward to that port instead
of 119.
3)  Verify that your ISP is not blocking port 119 from specific packet types.
4)  Get a packet sniffer and watch what happens to requests for that
particular site if you can't change the port number.

Hope this helps!

Hello !

I know port 119 is used for news.

On any computer, if i type web.verfaillie.com:119 the connection can't be 
made, since the browser expects a NEWS response of some sort.
If i type http://web.verfaillie.com:119 the connection is made, because the 
browser expects a HTTP response.
The problem is the latest version of IE (the version you can download and 
that's included with XP).
It does tot allow http connections over a news port.

It is not a problem with firewalls and ISP: when using a Netscape browser 
(on the same computer), the page can be retrieved.

For now i suggest users to use Netscape. For now the site is only for a 
limited user group.

I'm looking for some register fix to allow IE to connect.

If you know this, why are you using that port?  I made specific note of it
and suggested using a different port altogether...but that seems
unacceptable to you for some reason that I'd like to know.

>On any computer, if i type web.verfaillie.com:119 the connection can't be 
>made, since the browser expects a NEWS response of some sort.

And I told you why.  HINTERNET is probably interfering and attempting a
NEWS connection.  HINTERNET is how IE communicates its desires for
information across the Internet.  Change the port number to some non-mapped
port that is not 21, 25, 80, 110, or 119 and your problems dealing with
HINTERNET will go away.

>It is not a problem with firewalls and ISP: when using a Netscape browser 
>(on the same computer), the page can be retrieved.

Your assumption that, at the firewall level, packets are not affected is an
incorrect assumption.  Firewalls can and _DO_ interfere depending on
whether they are passive or not.  They can do anything from just blocking
packets of certain types to modifying the packet itself before delivering
it.  IE 6.0 (via HINTERNET) _could_ be sending out packets that are getting
dropped by your firewall for being ill-formed or redirecting them to the
wrong machine.  I just wanted to make sure I covered all the bases and made
you aware of the fact that your firewall could be the problem.

>For now i suggest users to use Netscape. For now the site is only for a 
>limited user group.

Well, you will be continuing to limit your user group if you force them to
use older versions of IE or use Mozilla/Netscrape.

>I'm looking for some register fix to allow IE to connect.

This is probably the best way to lose users/customers...tell them they have
to modify the Windows registry to visit your site.

If I sound a bit upset, it is because:

1)  I gave several suggestions on how to fix the problem and you failed to
address those suggestions in your response.
2)  You attempted to rephrase your problem that I already completely
understood as if I didn't understand the problem completely.
3)  You seek an answer that will destroy your current and future customer
base.

The third reason is what I am most concerned about here.  You seem to have
no concern for your customers...and you will ultimately lose them as a
result.  If you don't deal with this issue properly, you will end up losing
even your most loyal customers.

Hope this helps!

Our ISP only makes the standard internet ports available.
That is: 25, 80, 119, ...
Only 119 is left over.
Port 80 is used for our normal webserver, port 119 is used for a limited 
group of users.

I'm not a firewall specialist, but how could a request from Netscape be let 
through, and a request by IE blocked? (Using the same computer)
After upgrading from IE 4.0 to IE 6.0 the request was also blocked.
So i assume it's a Internet explorer thing.

I'm not afraid of losing users ... there are very captive indeed: the 
server is used by our sales representatives to get some (private) 
informations from our site when there are on location or at home.
They are all used to IE and don't quite like netscape...

Having to use port 119 is a good thing (no virus of other malevolent user 
is actually trying to connect)...


I'm not used that the correspondents completely understand my questions 
from the first run (english is my 3rd language), so i tried again from the 
beginning. Maybe i didn't made it clear enough that it is just some sort of 
communication between "registered" users who don't mind that i mix with 
their computer's registry.

A suggestion. If the SSL port (443) is available, how about using
xitami pro and using a secure session for your sales reps?

Ahh...that helps answer a few things.  There are two solutions to this
problem that make sense and one that might work:

1)  Get a different ISP (probably the better route).
2)  Get another static IP Address with a different domain from your ISP.
3)  Ask your ISP to open a specific port for you (not likely to happen, but
worth asking about).

Upgrading IE from 4.0 to 6.0 also applies kernel-level and driver patches
to the Windows OS itself...I've fixed several machines with this approach
that had viruses on them (I removed the viruses first, of course, but this
fixed the collateral damage).  So, when I say it has to do with HINTERNET,
that is the communication mechanism IE uses.  Mozilla/Netscape uses normal
socket communications...hence, it works and IE doesn't.  The HINTERNET
library, during the upgrade process to IE 6.0 probably got replaced with
something "better" that breaks the communication with your server by
sending a NEWS request instead of an HTTP request.  I originally suggested
dropping the firewall temporarily so that you could see the exact packets
coming through in case some packets were being malformed by HINTERNET (most
decent firewalls usually drop malformed packets).

Then enable them to use IE without requiring them to make changes to their
OS.  Besides, Netscape hasn't been usable since v3.0 (IMO).

>Having to use port 119 is a good thing (no virus of other malevolent user 
>is actually trying to connect)...

That may be true right now.  However, port scanners will eventually see
that 119 is open and discover that it isn't a news server running, but a
rogue HTTP server...then you will have serious security and data integrity
problems if the data is worth getting at and manipulating.

Trust me, they DO mind and they probably talk behind your back as well if
you consistently require them to do such things to use your system like
edit their Windows registry.  Your job should be to make sure they can
_EASILY_ do whatever they need to do...even if it takes more money, effort,
and time on YOUR behalf to make it easier for _THEM_.  Enough of this part
of the discussion, your attitude about your own salespeople/registered
users/etc. says to me that you really don't care about them...let alone
your real customers.  If you aren't willing to go out of the way for your
internal people, how much more does that apply to those who are external!

Hope this helps!

It's available but planned (dry run till connected & secured to our SQL) 
for taking customers' orders.
Strange IE accepts the page even if it is not secure...

With IPv4 there are not much free fixed ip numbers available, and i use the 
one that i get for all possible means.

Thanks anyway, maybe this can help somebody else ...

You are not right in saying i don't care for my users.
Most of the programming (the cgi interface) is done at home in my free time.
I've explored all the alternatives: another IP: too expensive for the boss 
(i agree with him)
Open other ports: ISP's representative sent a standard message back that 
states wich ports can be opened. Can't talk to an autoresponder.
Another ISP: too much work, not sure it will be better (other providers 
don't allow us to run servers for the same price we pay for our current 
connection).
Compared to the cost of another IP, a simple registry trick (if available) 
will be very appreciated!

My job is indeed to make sure my users (sales rep.) can do easily whatever 
they want to do: access their IMAP mail and local directories, connect to 
our SQL server, and all this using a single interface: Internet Explorer. 
All this configuration is done after hours.
And since the normal "web" port is already reserved for visiting customers, 
i have to use another port.

Message-ID: <019601c33c53$08b46ca0$45c46840@apac.cisco.com>

Folks, I recently installed Xitami on Windows 2000 as a service (v
2.4d9) and I have found that it will hog 100% of the CPU even when not
serving any pages. 

I tried suspending Xitami from the control panel "Xitami Web Server
Properties" page and that did not seem to have any effect.  In fact once
it starts hogging the CPU the only way to kill it is to reboot the
machine (killing it from the task manager would not work).

Has anyone else seen this CPU hog under Windows 2000 and know how to fix
it ??

Matt

PS: On a possibly related issue, I was wondering why Xitami was using so
much of my hard disk when I found a .lst file of >1Gb.  Due to size
contraints I was forced to delete this - but I think it might have been
some sort of core file.

I've never seen that problem occur except during development sessions when
a CGI process ran rampant from an infinite while-loop or something similar.
 However, since I have dual-processors, I never really notice CPU usage as
Xitami only utilizes one processor...leaving me the other one to do other
things like compile applications, etc.

If Xitami is running as an NT service, you have to kill it from the service
manager or a command prompt using the 'net stop' command.  Task manager can
only kill processes owned by your user...you can't kill "SYSTEM"-owned
processes directly.

Hope this helps!

Perhaps for xitami, just add a Virtual Server and give it a seperate name
such as offered at ODS.Org and still use/share standard port 80
then your salesforce can access it using 'SecretName.ODS.Org' plus password.
...That's certainly simple enough.

Hello !

I already do a redirect from a virtual host to another server running 
Xitami using another port.
The problem is on the client side (sales force), who, when upgrading to the 
latest IE are not able to connect anymore.

Is there a reason you need to run two Xitami servers?
All other things being equal (which they may not be), you can serve both
domains from a single server.
I run 6 domains on 1 server, with 1 IP and one instance of port 80. Each
domain has its own set of configuration files, security, etc. Virtual hosts
can be very nice.

There is a reason.
We have a "public" server (accessible on port 80) for our customers and a 
"private" server running on port 119. The router directs the requests to 
the correct server using NAT.
Both are on different machines for security reasons; with the private 
server it is possible to access our corporate data, mail, SQL. It is just 
another layer of security.

I'm not familiar with FoxWeb, but it looks to me like
you have the URL elements out of order -- try:

http://localhost/cgi-bin/foxweb.exe/text1.prg

and make sure your "foxweb.exe" is in "c:\cgi-bin"

It's NOT left over; it's there in case you want to run a newsserver
(although judging by your apparent lack of competence, I'd hate to see
you inflicting an insecure server on the world).

Do you not understand the concept of "Well-Known Services"?  They've been
enshrined in the 'net for about two decades or more.  I'd suggest reading
through the services file (that will be somewhere on your computer, even
if it's *not* a Unix box).  You MUST NOT use any of the ports listed
therein to provide any other service than the one allocated by IANA.

Why not get yourself a less restrictive (and more knowledgable) ISP?

So it may be; the problem is that /most/ browsers attempt to be helpful
to lazy users.  In particular, to those users that fail to specify a
transfer schema in their URLS.  Netscape automatically assume that
"http://" has been prepended to anything that doesn't start with
"<something>://", as does IE.  IMHO, ideally, a browser should reject any
such URL as being malformed.

However, it would appear that more recent versions of IE take into
account any port number, if it's for one of the WKS, and therefore
prepends "news://" if there's a ":119" on the end of the URL.

Will IE6 not work if provided with a FULL URL, including schema, host,
and port?  If it does work, then make sure you always publish links in
full like that.

Now you really ARE displaying incredible ignorance and naivety.  Ask
anyone that really IS running a news server on port 119; most get upwards
of a hundred or more connections per day from people looking for open
servers.

The amount of ISP's in my region is very limited.
We have one national telecom operator (Belgacom: phone/gsm/dial 
up/adsl/sdsl) and one cable operator (Telenet, that is even more restrictive).
Smaller companies that could be more user-fiendly uses the telecom 
operator's network and settings and eventually provide their own servers.

[... lots of bashing removed ...]
The server is for private use, we do not request that customers abide by 
these rules.

I always use the full url in the redirect (i'm writing html stuff for 
nearly 10 years)

Logs don't show any strange connect activity. I even installed a packet 
sniffer (ethereal).
Using another server and another port for our more sensitive data is just 
part of a broader set of measures:
- load some page (could be located anywhere)
- this page contains a <script src=http://mypublicserver/cgi-bin/...>-tag 
displaying nothing, but get the client's IP registered for one minute
- go to the private server default page (it's a cgi that also checks the IP).
- This page contains a <input type=hidden> field with a hash (or is a 
redirection to the main server if the IP was not registered).
- login to the private server with login, pass (and hidden field)
- the hash is modified each time a new page is asked for
- without correct hash, any request on the private server is redirected to 
the main server
- and so on

We are not such a big company that hackers will try for hours to find out 
how to get past the login screen, if they ever get there.
The only thing they will get is the server name (Xitami rules!) and a 
un-conspicuous redirection to the main server.
I could install a point-to-point tunnelling protocol, but the isp asks LOTS 
of money for making this service available (we simply can't afford it).

Could we go back to the question, now that some points of details have been 
cleared out?

Message-ID: <20030630142053.838D439F2@xmxpita.myway.com>


Hello,

I currently run Xitami on a windows 95 computer which is not connected to the web. At startup or whenever I try to run Xitami, I get the following dialog box:

Title: "Xitami was suspended"
Body:  "Could not open HTTP port 80 - Protocol not know (No error"

The host name is "http://default"
IP address is    "127.0.0.1"

On my other computer which is connected to the web, I have no problem at all, the local host is "http://localhost".

I think it's a problem of settings, but which one(s)?

Could someone help me? 

Best regards,
Benoit

Hello !

It could be that the TCP/IP stack is not installed.
You need it, even for accessing local pages.

Goto start/settings/Control panel/Network and check if TCP/IP is installed.
If not, install: Add/protocol/Microsoft/TCPIP
Have your windows CD near you.

Hello,

I have set up a password on directory. I was asked the password the

asked the password anymore. More over, this happens not only when I

Any idea ?

The password is probably cached in your (Mozilla?) profile.  This is a
client issue, not an issue with Xitami.

Hope this helps!

Are you running Xitami as a service or a GUI application?  The NT service
is more stable than the GUI.

What version of OpenSSL is compiled into the server?  Most applications
should be fully switched over to the 0.9.7 series (latest = 0.9.7b) unless
there is sufficient reason to stick with the older 0.9.6 series (latest =
0.9.6j).  Anything less than 0.9.7b or 0.9.6j is subject to security
vulnerabilities (and/or crash bugs depending on how old it is) and XiPro
should be upgraded immediately.

Hope this helps!

How can I tell which version of openssl is compiled into xitami?
the dates on my xipro.exe and xiprosrv.exe files is 12/05/2001 so I'm sure it can't have 0.9.7b since that version of openssl wasn't released yet...
how do I get the newest version?

we do run xitami as a gui application rather than a service, so that may have something to do with the crashes as well..but they just started recently, which is what made me believe it's probably openssl related...

Thanks for the info!

The archive is at:

http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/

which is linked from the mailing list information URL:

http://lists.xitami.org/mailman/listinfo/xitami

that is included with every post on the list.

The archive, unfortunately, doesn't directly support searching.  But it
might be indexed by some search engines now; or you can download the
various archives of the list and search them yourself.

Average download speed of 23.7 K/s
normally 25-26 K/s
using ADSL 256 line
server does NOT support resuming
using Getright for download
approximate 8-10 minute download
does not support multi link.
file downloaded :  CoursePlayerInstaller_51725.exe
No corruption in download
Location download for me:  Mexico

Note...
If you were to install Apache, then put only your download section under
Apache,
That would change your download:  access to resuming, and multi links.
When using a download accelaerator, it verifies the download while putting
the thing back together..
To access the other download page from Xitami, is really quite simple,  just
access as if it was an extension form your own page, but at a different
port.
i.e.
http://www.yourpage.com/  is to your page under xitami   however
http://www.yourpage.com:8080/ is to the apache server setup for port 8080
and to handle all downloads,
then when done comes back to the main page....?
or however you have it set up...
I WISH xitami could handle those two things...
Other than that Xitami is perfect...

Hi Bill,

I had the same problem a week or so ago whereby I had problems with my V-Host.
Im behind a NAT myself and am not sure what Cable modem users have but it
should be same or similar. (We sortof have a STATIC IP in other words.)

Ive managed to create several virtual-host by using a system that's free'ly available
called a Dynamic DDNS service here: http://dyndns.org/
(According to some KZey or ZKey site that test these type systems, the one above is best.)

If you own a registered DNS name from InterNic try using (Simple DNS Plus) here: 
http://www.jhsoft.com/

I don't know what level you're at so I'll try to start from the beginning

Start Xitami, click setup and at the Xitami Administration Window that comes up,
click Virtual Host. At the top of this screen there's a new button click that one and
add-in the account names you created at http://dyndns.org/ or with Simple DNS Plus.
Make certain that your .cfg and .aut files that correspond to these V-Host exist in
the main Xitami directory.
 
If you need further assist let us know but this should get you started.

regards,
Euman

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20030625191710.009ed7e0@mail.verfaillie.com>

Hello !

Does anybody know how to open non-standard ports for web (client side)?
Webmail is already on port 80.

The internet explorer that ships with w98 and w2k allows the use of 
non-standard ports.
IE 6.0 does not allow the use of this port, and i can't use any port above 
1024 because my isp only allows standard ports.

Is there some registry-trick to force the latest IE version to use 
non-standard ports?

Hello !

Even a win98 computer with IE 6.0 block these ports (after upgrading from 
IE 4.x)

Hello !

I know port 119 is used for news.

On any computer, if i type web.verfaillie.com:119 the connection can't be 
made, since the browser expects a NEWS response of some sort.
If i type http://web.verfaillie.com:119 the connection is made, because the 
browser expects a HTTP response.
The problem is the latest version of IE (the version you can download and 
that's included with XP).
It does tot allow http connections over a news port.

It is not a problem with firewalls and ISP: when using a Netscape browser 
(on the same computer), the page can be retrieved.

For now i suggest users to use Netscape. For now the site is only for a 
limited user group.

I'm looking for some register fix to allow IE to connect.

Oh boy, have I ever had this problem! Nobody had any idea's how to fix it.
Xitami at this point has crashed, and is attempting to write a memory dump,
called memtrace.lst. However, this debug routine is buggy, and keeps on
dumping to the file unitl your HDD is full. My best was a 32GB file. :-(
Only way out is to reboot the machine, Xitami no longer responds to any
service calls.
Very frustrating. I'm running the same setup as you. To think I went to the
service version to make it MORE stable. Hah!
I went back to the Win32 version, and use a batch file to restart it if it
crashes. At least it crashes gracefully, unlike the service version.
