Subject: [Xitami] ASP MIME won't work. please help
Message-ID: <W1942929249107381096819640@webmail4>

I am somewhat new to using Xitami and I really need ot activate ASP to work in my web pages.

I know, many will say, You're not running IIS, then why and so on.
Just trust me, I have 100,000 line sof code ready made and I want to use what I have, not re-invent the wheel again. Just get my site up and running.

SO, to make it simple...

I added the mime type in the default.cfg file to specify asp=text/html

Still nothing. THe page comes up but the code doesn't execute.

So, how do I enable this thing to run on my machine.

I have two systems running.

a) Windows 2000 Pro with IIS 5 and ASP support and the port is changed to allow Xitami to run on 80

b) Windows 2003 Server Std with IIS6 and IIS installed and allowed.

In other words ASP should run fine.

What am I missing?

I know this would not be the place for this normally but sales & support emails at IMATIX.COM are not responding and failing delivery.

Also, their corporate fax number in Brussels is not picking up???

Is Xitami going out of business??

Corporate fax numbers in Brussels???
Xitami has a mirror in Brussels (at Skynet), but no division ...

Wrong way to do it. That will only serve up the ASP code as HTML as 
you discovered. You need to add a filter. Like:
[Filter]
    .asp=D:\\chilisoft\\asp.exe

But: Xitami can't run ASP. Only IIS and PWS can, natively, for others 
(xitami included) you need an ASP parser such as Chilisoft ASP (now 
obviously bought by Sun, don't know of alternatives, only that there 
are). You will have to run it in CGI mode, which is very slow. The 
beta version of Xitami has ISAPI support and may run some kind of 
ISAPI ASP parser (much, much faster), but the beta version is less 
stable and much buggier in my experience. Basically, Xitami is very 
ill-suited to doing ASP, or indeed any kind of server-side scripting 
requiring CGI parsing.

Plus, Xitami is unofficially dead. No long term solution. My advice 
would be to switch to something supported.

I'd like that it is untrue, the only who can deny this are at Imatix... and
they seems to be around for a long time here... I'm very displeased of this
because i really like Xitami. I really appreciate if anyone at Imatix just
say "hello, we are here"....

Well, they /are/ here somewhere, but they have basically said 
themselves that Xitami is unlikely to be supported much in the 
future. And the proof is in the pudding... how long has 2.5 been in 
beta? I started using 2.4 (d7?) many many moons ago, and it hasn't 
gone beyond 2.4 ever since ;-)

It is still an excellent solution for people needing straight static 
serving (robust with speed), but for today's complex sites, well...

I've been trying to download the install package of 2.4 or 2.5. But it no
longer comes with an installer, unless I'm missing something.

Hello, we are here.  Busy, but here.

I'm sorry we don't spend more time reading and replying to the Xitami list.  
It's one of many things we have to spend time on, and inevitably gets less 
attention that it deserves.

Xitami is, obviously, a project that is fairly static.  We make patches now 
and then, especially when there are security issues.  The server solves a 
problem for many people but we cannot compete with the huge resources put 
behind products like Apache, and we would be foolish to try.

Allow me to explain briefly where we are and how we got here...

When we started Xitami in 1996 the goal was not to develop a web server so 
much as to demonstrate a way of building servers.  That's why it was open 
source from day 1.  Unfortunately (for our spare time and personal lives), we 
were dragged kicking and screaming into developing our prototype into a real 
working server.  I can speak for most of the Xitami team when I say that it 
has always been a real pleasure to see our work used by so many enthusiastic 
people, but that the flip side has been a support burden that rapidly became 
impossible.

In 2000-01 or so, we were forced to concentrate on earning money: this was 
banal and much less satisfying than making Xitami better but the few licenses 
we sold for Xitami/Pro did not start to cover even our network costs, let 
alone work on the product.

I've been asked by members of our team to "officially declare Xitami dead" 
several times.  I've resisted.  We use the software ourselves.  We use it on 
websites and in products like smt@ (www.sms-at.com), which is one of the ways 
we make a living.

We spoke to the Apache team in 1999 and were happy to see that they were 
heading towards an architecture like ours: a portability layer, a bunch of 
protocol handlers, a fully portable server.  Today Apache 2 is a fast, 
portable server and seriously: you should be using Apache 2 instead of Xitami 
unless there are specific things Xitami does better for you.

At iMatix we're going through the same boom/bust/boom cycles as everyone else 
in the industry.  We made some money in 1999-2001, we lost most of it in 
2002-2003, and we're now growing again with some interesting projects.  So 
iMatix is definitely here, and will be for a long time.

But... Xitami as a living product... it's clearly something who's time has 
come and gone.  The need for a small, fast, portable web server was painfully 
obvious in 1997-2000, and we are proud to have achieved what we did.  But 
today it's a niche product.

We will continue to provide updates of Xitami, we will continue to publish the 
source code.  Other people may spend the time building binaries and nice 
installers - this is no longer our job.

I hope this is a satisfactory answer.

On behalf of the Xitami team, which has included myself, Ewen McNeill, 
Jonathan Schultz, Julie Pesesse, and numerous other people in various roles 
over the years, I'd like to thank our users, friends and contributers for 
their patience and good will.  It has not been easy to spend such a huge 
effort in writing what we consider to be an excellent server, and to see it 
become almost totally irrelevant, but your feedback and support over the 
years has made it worthwhile.

1. Check the log files (console.log, xitami.log).

2. Run the console version: it will show the cause of the error on the screen 
directly.

Those of us that use and know Xitami on a daily basis don't expect it to 
be an Apache. We appreciate it for what it is. A lean, mean, web-serving 
machine.

I paid my change for Xitami. Its capable of doing a lot, should one have 
the desire to put some of their own effort into it.

I also can sympathize with your team as a developer myself.

This I take issue with.

Apache does not run "out of the box". Xitami does.

Apache is a horrid mess (no offense Apache folks) of configuration 
options, files, etc. Xitami has a clean and (most importantly) easy 
configuration that most can figure out just by looking at it.

I have used Xitami for going on 5 years now and have NO intention of 
switching to apache or any other web-server. I have invested too much 
time and effort in writing the scripts and support mechanisms to do what 
I need to do on a daily basis with Xitami to go elsewhere..

I'm also using Xitami for years. It's the only server that runs nearly 
out-of-the-box.
When i install the server at some customers, i know that it will work, and 
if not, it's not webserver-related.

We use it at our company (2 servers) and at home on a dynamic IP (where i 
use it for remote monitoring and controling of my central heater). It 
displays a real time high res graphic of the temperature (outside, 
basement, living, sleeping room, hot water, ...)
Before going home, i log in to my server to switch the heating on. Not cold 
enough to start the server yet.

Tried Sambar, compared to Xitami it has lots of features, but it's not so 
easy to configure.

I think a lot of people don't realize Xitami is Open Source. Why not put it
on sourceforge.net, and really get it open for more development. Actually I
see an entry for Xitami on SourceForge here
http://sourceforge.net/projects/imatix-xitami/ but it doesn't seem to be all
that active.

I am pretty happy with the way my Xitami install is running on my Win2K pro.
It just chuggs right along, except I don't use the FTP portion. I have been
contemplating making the jump to Xitami Pro. My one complaint is that it
doesn't do ASP. I have it set up for PHP, Perl, and Cold Fusion but have
been asked for ASP.

I have dealt with IIS and Linux in the past, but I really like Xitami for
ease in maintainance and setting up new domains.

Those of us that use and know Xitami on a daily basis don't expect it to
be an Apache. We appreciate it for what it is. A lean, mean, web-serving
machine.

I agree with Craig here.
I have Xitami for 4/5 years also, i just got my brand new Suse Linux 9.1
where Apache2 is included, but my web server will stay Xitami on a W2k box.
If i move to the Linux box, i'll put Xitami there also.

I am rather new to Xitami (6 months), and I love it.  It's been very easy
for me to understand and work with and the support when I have needed it,
has been incredible here.  I did use Apache before and found it to be too
difficult to work with, Xitami pulled my domains together and it's been a
flawless program for me.

Thank you for such a great product and thank you even more, for outstanding
support!

I'm also a Xitami user since 4 years.
I use it on 3 public servers and one of them has more than 250 domains under
w2k.
I use it also for our intranet.

Easy to install, simple to configure and stable.
Never had problems.

Keep it living!!

Message-ID: <20041006193444.FC7EFDA8.proudneck@yahoo.es>

Hi:

I'm new to the list. I checked some months back if the answer is 
somewhere but ... a lot of months and only I have a life :/

Well as the subject says it's about htm and html files: Is there a way 
to make xitami treat them different?

Here in example:
I have a site with a file named xxx.html.
I have another file with a link to xxx.htm (no html).
I click the link in this file that points xxx.htm.

Why Xitami route you to the xxx.html file intead the xxx.htm? That no 
exists so it would display a 404 error... but no, it doesn't, it routes 
you to the other file.

And now, testing... I don't know why, with some .htm promts you to save 
them instead route you .html or 404 error. I changed mime, but i 
restored again...

So, any help?

Thanks.

Hello Paulo Silva you emitted about Re: [Xitami] Status of Xitami ??

Hiyas all,
I can only second that, i use xitami for about 4 years now and it's really 
great out of the box in less than a minute setup fast webserver with some 
bonus features.

It always worked and will still be working fine for me as long as it can.
It's running on BeOS here and serving intranet and internet related issues.
Most stuff works with xitami well or either great, you get more than enough 
web and ftp power for the free version.
I've tried many other servers like apache, and special designed ones but they 
never outperformed xitami for my needs.

With kind regards,
Ted,
Netherlands.

Thanks for the time you'all spent on your comments to this Subject.

I was the one that started this subject and the QUESTION has been answered with overwhelming
positive responses.

I was a developer for a long time (op sys, assemblers, various applications, protocols, compilers, etc.),,,,,but that was about 20 years ago. I took another direction rather than writing code!!!! :) :) Still do not write code, and allow the current professionals do their tricks!!!!! I have often thought it would be nice to get back into it and even thought about the open source of Xitami. But, that was just a fleeting moment (1 nsec). I have taken a look at some of that source code structure and to say the least it is an excellant design. Easy to follow, commented, and documented internally more than expected, etc.

I understand Peter's comments and the ever changing roles in a software development task as time goes on.

I also see that there is no desire at this time to end the Xitami Project or Support by iMatix. However, based on the current point in time of Xitami development other issues must be given priority----mainly feeding the family :) :)

I would like to offer the highest complements for the effort that Peter Hintjens, Ewen McNeill, Jonathan Schultz, Julie Pesesse, and the numerous other people that have put their time into the deveopment of Xitami. As well as the decision to offer it as open source as wello as the Xitami/PRO. These platforms have had terrific direction and a GREAT staff to manage these products!!!!

Along with the members of this GREAT Email Forum Support Group, the comments offered in this Subject, plus comments by Peter I am confident that Xitami support will continue at some level and be a product just as mentioned in the replies of this Subject---- A GREAT PRODUCT with GREAT Support. And, with this Email support group, plus those members that have selected the management of the open source, there seems to be a never ending level of support no matter what direction iMatix is forced to proceed.

Xitami at this site as well as Pro and the ease of use and support will continue to be used as well as recommended for other sites as required. 

The original question has been answered: Simply----"It aint so, etc. !"       :) :)

THANKS to all for the replies.

Jerry

      Buggy.

You missed an important word.  Apache 2 is still buggy under Windows.
Better, but still buggy.  And convoluted.  The five configuration files are
evil convolutions of reality and very user-unfriendly.

Okay, before you kill off the product, I believe I have finally figured out
why Xitami and ProtoNova are only generating low-volume sales.  Fairly
obvious in 20/20 hindsight.

First off, when business owners want to build a network with Windows, they
typically purchase a NT Server-based solution from Microsoft because
Microsoft tells them they need to and they don't realize they can run a
server on client PCs (e.g. WinXP Pro).  As part of that purchase decision,
they implicitly choose IIS.  The only reason they don't know about other
web servers is because no one is marketing server alternatives to them.
Microsoft doesn't have to advertise IIS, they only have to advertise the OS.

A consumer, on the other hand, will want a cheap or free server.  The basic
Xitami server provides that and ProtoNova provides the cheaper and more
secure route for SSL.  Consumers may typically go for Apache if they hear
it holds 50% of the market share, but will likely look around for
solutions.  Consumers are a terrible market expectation as they are really
uninformed when it comes to software and usually end up loyal to a
not-so-well-written product X.  This group typically relies on friends to
make recommendations for software - also known as the grapevine.

Business owners wanting to use Linux will automatically choose Apache
regardless of the numerous options available.  Linux Apache users are
honestly the most stubborn people in existence who won't change over to
anything else.  You can effectively forget ever getting a sale from them.

Finally, you have tinkerers - people who like to play with things to try
them out.  There are very few of these people in existence and they tend to
hunt down the best products available and constantly weigh their options
with other factors (e.g. budget and time constraints).  I am most likely a
tinkerer as I've used Apache, IIS, Xitami, ProtoNova, Sambar, and 10 other
web servers with my personal preference being ProtoNova.

Now of those four general groups of people, which are most likely to buy
Xitami, ProtoNova, or one of the host of other servers out there?



If you answered the tinkering group, you are correct and have sound
business sense.  Targetting a group of tinkerers is a great way to get
locked in a market niche and lose a business.  Not one of those other
groups will buy any web server let alone switch without a sound business
reason...and that means addressing the bottom line.  You have to give the
people who make purchase decisions a really good reason to buy any given
product.  If they already have a web server and it _seems_ to be serving
their needs (regardless if it is causing the business millions every year),
they won't consider bringing anything different into the mix.  So, the
three largest areas where a web server could potentially be used are out
(with the occassional exception).  That's 80+ percent of the market share
right there.

This explains why Xitami and ProtoNova are not the best success stories in
the world.  Now, before anyone kills off either one, I have one last bit to
say.  There is a growing undercurrent of users of IIS and/or Apache under
Windows that are getting fed up.  Not quite to the point of hunting down
alternatives, but dangerously close that Microsoft is worried.  Of the
servers I present such users, people are most intrigued by ProtoNova but
are ultimately turned off because of _migration issues_.  That is, they
_want_ to move away from IIS to ProtoNova, but _can't_ because of the time
it would take to switch.  Remember, time equals money.  This means that
ProtoNova is dangerously close to swiping a large chunk of the market share
to be had and giving Microsoft a run for its money.  From a technical
standpoint, all that has to be addressed is IIS to ProtoNova migration to
make ProtoNova succeed.  There are other issues as well, but that is the
biggest technical hurdle.  Xitami needs a ton of work before the same thing
could happen.

Why am I sharing this information with direct competitors?  Because iMatix
has effectively stated that they really do not want to support Xitami any
more.  Therefore, the ProtoNova development team would love to take this
obvious burden away from iMatix.  ProtoNova was _designed_ for Xitami
users, meaning migration to ProtoNova from Xitami is simple and should only
take an hour or two for really complex setups.  There are, of course, some
differences, but out-of-the-box, ProtoNova functions in an almost identical
fashion to Xitami except that CGIs execute much faster under ProtoNova and
you never have to restart the server to make configuration changes (e.g.
dynamically bring Virtual Hosts and servers online/offline).

Xitami is 3 years behind ProtoNova in development and 4 years since its
last true update (emergency 1-5 line security fixes don't count).  The
logical decision, if you are concerned about Xitami, is to just move to
ProtoNova.  You are guaranteed the following or your money back:  If you
use ProtoNova and ever have issues with the server itself, you can be
doggone sure they _will_ get fixed - ProtoNova is a well-supported product.
 Additionally, if you need a feature added, ask and you shall receive.

For those who want a brief overview of ProtoNova.  ProtoNova has LRWP (1.0
and 2.0), Java Servlet, ColdFusion, PHP, Perl, Nuclear Vision, and custom
CGI support along with a complete interface for making your own custom
add-on modules that is much more secure and versatile than LRWP.  It uses
an ODBC-compliant database for logging almost everything.  It is massively
scalable and load-balances everything from memory use to Remote Module
management.  (Remote Modules are how CGIs, LRWP, etc. work).  It also has
features such as never having to restart the server (or sending the
HUP-equivalent signal) and automatic DoS detection and prevention
mechanisms.  It only runs on Windows at this point (there is a Linux
version, but it is not ready for production), but the goal of the server is
to be capable of carrying any load on any PC while being smart about
today's Internet security issues.  In relation to security, Apache will
return a 403 Forbidden error to the user if they try to access an illegal
page - ProtoNova returns a 404 Not Found error to the user.  Neither are
desireable, but which one will most likely keep a hacker out of restricted
areas?

Hi Peter,

and hi to all here that are using Xitami. It seems that even we are not so
much, we all really like so much. So much that even if not with full
support, even if long time between updates (not so needed... i think xitami
hasn't many problems :-)), even with someone (not including you) trying to
tell us "xitami is dead, go away and use apache" (or other webservers...),
there are many of us still here, still wanting this server works for us,
someone for it's simple use, some for little resource needed, someone for
multiplatform support, someone for any other thing (personally i really like
LRWP, that's why I'm here).

I really understand what you answered to all of us, and we can't force you
to nothing, xitami is a creature of yours, but i think the idea to put it on
sourceforge and let all the people like me and others that seems to be still
around to help live this project can be very good, and it seems that a long
time ago you thought the same way... Our interest is not to compete with
Apache or with any other thing, is only to let us use Xitami at best, couse
we like it. Stop. You don't have time to do that, but some of us may use
some free time to help this to go on.

I hope you don't see this like some interference in your work, I was sorry
even when last month I proposed a fix to a problem I had with slow
connection and after some time I put out some recompiled EXEs to see if that
problem was fixed. I just want xitami is secure and working fine.... (and
perfect?), nothing else.

Dario B.

Thomas,

:-)  Just wondering whether ProtoNova is based on Xitami, and if so, whether 
you're providing the source code.

Hello Pieter,

No.  ProtoNova relies heavily on LibLink - the core coding library of
Shining Light Productions.  Neither ProtoNova or LibLink has code in it
from Xitami or the iMatix libraries (e.g. SFL, SMT, etc.)

Hello Dario,

as I mentioned I will try the iplist.txt in a different way.
My iplist.txt looks like this and it is working perfectly fine. I use this not only for my local 
addresses even for public ones.
here we go

webmask= !xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx		# excluding this particular IP
webmask= *						# all others allowed

I find this more convenient then putting more than one ip in a single line.

Tack fr svaret Magnus.

-- ok in English so all can read it.
Thats a scary thought, Xitami being unofficially dead.
I've always perceived it to be one of the best solutions for small scaled sites with a really simple interface to work with and much less overhead in config files to manually add information too.

I guess I have to follow the mainstream and run with IIS and Apache instead then :(

All you need to get it installed is download and extract it to the locati=
on you want to use it in. Copy and rename the APP folder enclosed to what=
 you want it to be and then you're set in default mode.

Double click the XIGUI to start on Win machines.

If you dont want to use the STARTUP folder in the program menu simply add=
 a link to the app path you made by ...

click START
click RUN
enter REGEDIT
click ENTER
go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/MICROSOFT/WINDOWS/CurrentVersion/RUN/

Add STRING
add the path in the string...

Reboot and you're up.

When attempting to connect to my FTP server, I can connect up to the welcome
screen, but the data socket won't connect.  I have shifted my http port base
to 2030, and that works fine.  That should make the FTP port shift to 2051,
and the data socket to 2050.  Since the server is behind a NAT router
firewall, I should only need ports 2110, 2050, and 2051 open on the firewall
for all of it to work.  Still, I cannot get the data socket to go, even
using PASV.  I have even set the server to DMZ so all ports were available,
and it still won't work.  I'm at a loss.  Any Ideas?  I'm running v2.5b6

Thank you!

I've been using Xitami since 1998, and have never really had any
problems with it ... you could build one of the old 2.4d* versions and
have it run for years without touching it (I do mean years ... I have
one web server with well over 400 days uptime, no hiccups).

I've not had quite the same luck with 2.5 versions, but that's mainly
due to issues building them.  I'm also working, in my spare time, to
make 2.5 build on HPPA since that's my latest toy :)

But good work, y'all; as far as I'm concerned, Xitami is "done" and
doesn't need more features; bugs appear mostly fixed, and security
patches get made.  What else could one ask for?  (no, I don't want ASP
:)

You can say that again.

After having been with Xitami since it was first released, I did look at
Apache yesterday.

It took a while to determine whether they actually called it apache or httpd
and then a struggle to find where to put the files I wanted to offer to the
visitors.

And I simply love the HowTos and Manuals that say ``You won't have any trouble
with this because it works like <substitute any of a dozen programmes I never
even heard of> ''

When attempting to connect to my FTP server, I can connect up to the welcome
screen, but the data socket won't connect.  I have shifted my http port base
to 2030, and that works fine.  That should make the FTP port shift to 2051,
and the data socket to 2050.  Since the server is behind a NAT router
firewall, I should only need ports 2110, 2050, and 2051 open on the firewall
for all of it to work.  Still, I cannot get the data socket to go, even
using PASV.  I have even set the server to DMZ so all ports were available,
and it still won't work.  I'm at a loss.  Any Ideas?  I'm running v2.5b6

Thank you!

Hi,
Just another person who is very happy with Xitami and have been running it for years on old passed down hardware with little problems.

Many thanks,

Honestly, the worst part about Apache is that there is such a huge
following of people who don't know that there are better alternatives and
just continue spreading the word about it.  That said, Apache is actually
not too bad to use if you run Linux (already in the tinkerer group anyway -
that is, not your average computer user) _AND_ you don't want to do
anything fancy like virtual hosting or PHP.  Otherwise you have to quickly
get up to speed on the whole documentation end of things or just spend a
couple days hacking up the configuration files to something horrendous
(especially with VHosts).  I think that may be a major reason why users
won't leave Apache - they have too much time invested in it and don't want
to know that 30 seconds with Xitami or ProtoNova could have done the same
things they are currently doing.  It is more an issue of blind
leading/following the blind than anything else.  Of course, I understand
the feeling that if I invest a ton of time into something, I probably
wouldn't want to know about something that could have saved me weeks in a
matter of seconds either.  I would feel horrible about the issue for a long
time and then have to work up the guts to try Xitami or ProtoNova out.
There is a huge amount of inertia put in the way of an Apache user to
overcome.  Much more so than an IIS user.  IIS users are basically fed up
with Microsoft.  Every IIS web developer I've spoken with knows it is a
terrible server but can't switch.  How classic is that.  Books could be
written on the subject and movies made.

(Okay, maybe not movies - we have enough of the Lawrence of Arabia-style
movies to last 40 lifetimes).

PLEASE don't do this: whilst other recipients of your e-mails /might/
like them to arrivein both plain ASCII and also in pidgin-HTML, the
latter has no place on any mailing list (or newsgroup).

Find the setting in your mailer which says "only send HTML mail to
addressees known to like it" (or whatever the wording).

You seem to be arithmetically challenged.  The WKP (well-known ports) for
HTTP, FTP control, and FTP data are, respectively, 80, 21, and 20.

So if you add 1950 to shift the web server port up to 2030, then the FTP
ports will be at 1971 & 1970, and not at 2051/2050.

So what's 2110?  Aha!  I had misunderstood; you have added an OFFSET of
2030, not "shifted the http port" to 2030.  OK, so the FTP ports ought to
be at 2051/2050 as you say.  This wasn't exactly crystal clear.

Let's clarify: from the outside, anyone can connect to port 2051 and log
in to the ftpd?  You are behind a firewall, yes?  Is the FTP client
computer also behind a firewall?  There are always potentially problems
with the FTP data port if there are two firewalls involved.  In the non-
PASV case, the client will connect to port 20 to PUT data, but will use a
PORT command to tell the server whereabout to connect its port 20 to GET
a file; the client's firewall then needs to open that port, because in
non-passive mode, the server is the initiator of such data transfers.

If, OTOH, one uses PASV, then the server's firewall needs to allow
connections from the client to port 20 from any arbitrary socket for a
GET operation.

I believe you are saying that the FTP data port is not working on GET
(and LIST) operations, true?  To try to localize things, what happens if
you try a PUT operation?

Some of us came that route before learning about Xitami.
Hence that's why switched over right away.
I was fed up with Apache AND MS server issues that's why i choose the Xitami 
way,
almost sounds like PNP software.
guess what..... Hack it is!!!

I am one of the fortunate ppl that doesn't depend on either linux or Windows.
Xitami fits very well in the BeOS userfriendly envirement. Hardly any 
noticeble problems with it.

grts,

Well, to be perfectly honest, there are zero web servers out there that are
"user-friendly."  By user-friendly, I mean that I can sit the average
computer user down in front of a computer and tell them to run ProtoNova,
or Xitami, or IIS, or Apache, or iWeb, etc.  If it were between Xitami,
ProtoNova, IIS, and Apache, ProtoNova has the best _chance_ of working for
the user the first time.  The fact you use BeOS suggests to me you are a
power user and fall into the "tinkerer" category.  Over the past 3-4 years,
I have learned again what it truly means to be a user of a computer.  I am
a programmer by nature, but studying user habits has been a trait of mine.
Tinkerer/power user/etc. and user-friendly have two totally different
meanings to me.

The only problem is, you can't sell/market "user-friendly" to users.
They've been sold that by Microsoft already...and got burned.  Users are
therefore very skeptical about the phrase "user-friendly".  Those who are
just joining this list or are new to the whole web arena might be scared
off by this.  And for good reason - no one, not even the almighty iMatix or
the supreme Shining Light Productions or even the amazing Microsoft has
mastered the concept of user-friendly when it comes to web servers.  Now,
some are more usable than others, for sure, but not one single web server
in existence is truly usable.

That said, if I were to take the four top usable servers and factoring in
market conditions, they would be, in order of preference:

1)  IIS.
2)  ProtoNova.
3)  Xitami.
4)  Nothing else.  Not even Apache.  I've reviewed every server in
existence and know nothing comes anywhere close.  (I did say iWeb back
there...the author contacted me about it once after I rated it the worst
web server in existence performance-wise and she admitted it was true but I
didn't need to be so blunt).

#2 and #3 could be argued over - both are basically the same thing in
regards to usability, but it is a moot point since IIS won this contest.
"But," you'll just say that, "you just said ProtoNova has the best chance
of being usable with the average user."  That's true, but the average user
isn't going to be looking for a web server because _none_ of the above are
usable.  I said the 4 _top_ usable servers, not the 4 _most_ usable
servers.  There's a big difference between the two.

That's true. If there is a faster way to go in an view the list as it comes 
in, I'd like that.
Where is the link for it? :)


>(Sent direct as well, so he doesn't have to wait another 48h to see it!)

Much appreciate the service.

In fact, as I told Pieter today as well, I've been messing with the small 
side of Xitami since it first came out,
but basically to test some standard HTML designs when I first started 
learning that.

I have no plans whatsoever to change to the httpd mess, and I'm trying to get
the linux guys around me here to accept Xitami as well.


Later on I've done much more in ASP and VBS as well as CGI for VB
(Primarily VB5 since it's the first language that came out that was not 
directly possible to decompile.)

I still write my code in VB 5, keeping in mind, Dan Applemann's well placed 
words,
about not needing to buy the latest all the time to solve a simple business 
problem.

I have finally figured out the nicer parts of Xitami and it's virtual 
hosting features which are coming in handy as never before.

I have planned, in line with the desire to keep Xitami alive, to take up my 
CGI programming and minor workstation
coding again, with the intent to build a package that can actually handle 
DNS, SMTP/POP3 and FTP/HTTP
management both web based and WST based. Since I'll be doing  alot of this, 
why not build a good tool for it.

It will take some time and have to go on my spare time to-do schedule but 
I'll get something up there soon enough though.

Thanks all for reading this, and thanks in advance for any future help I 
may get from this forum.

hello,

in an effort to troubleshoot a problem i'm having with
a possible vulnerability, i have blocked outgoing tcp
port-range :3127-:3198 using the software firewall on
the pc which xitami runs from.

i have noticed however, that xitami transmits on a
very wide range of outgoing ports... and i'm now
wondering if this new setting 'could' interfere with
it's normal operation.

if any of you feel this may cause problems, please
feel free to offer some advice.  thank you

 rod

In the headers of EVERY mail sent from Xitami; see above :-)

In particular, you want <http://lists.xitami.org/mailman/listinfo/xitami>;
if you go there, one of the options is almost at the very end of the
page, and invites one:

    "To change your subscription (set options like digest and delivery
    modes, get a reminder of your password, or unsubscribe from Xitami),
    enter your subscription email address:"
    
One enters the currently subscribed mailbox address and clicks on the
"Options" button on the form; then the next page permits you to select
between setting "Digest Mode" to On or Off.  You must have the former; I
have the latter.  This means that each individual message is delivered to
me separately, rather than waiting for the accumulation throughout 24h.

Xitami will only use the port its listning on to transmit
on, what you might see is ftp transferes though, as they
use random port, http on the other hand uses only port 80
unless you have configured it for another port.

Thanks I fixed that...

and... I was just on the PHP site and downloaded version 5.0.2
It's pretty funny that this "so called" dead web server is the one out of 
THREE ONLY
that has a configuration tool provided from PHP.NET for the installation.

So IIS, XITAMI and one more ;) has special help.

That doesn't sound to dead to me.
Pretty nice recognition for Pieter and the others.

Hello !

Any cgi program has the same right as the webserver.
Under windows nt5, you can create a specific user with limited rights and 
run the webserver as this user.

First create a new user with the correct access rights, then change the 
Xitami rights to that of the user (start/programs/administrative 
tools/services, and locate Xitami somewhere at the end of the list, right 
click on the log on as and change to the new user)

You should not allow other people to run cgi programs, unless you secure 
your server.
It's never a good idea to let others upload programs to the cgi directory. 
It will always be a security risk.

I edit most of the cfg files by hand.
In creating new virtual hosts and other directories, I have noticed the 
following issues.
I edit cfg files and drop in new directories by FTP normally.

You have to restart the server before it picks up any new hosts and virtual 
directory settings.
In doing so, since I am sometimes pretty far away and cannot run over to 
the box and restart it.
So I log in to the web admin interface for the main account, which is 
enabled. The admin option for
all sub accounts are disabled. I click RESTART and wait without fail, it 
doesn't return to the web admin interface.
So I end up having to run over to the box anyway, terminate the server and 
restart it again.

Is there any solution to this or should I simply right my own CGI to kill 
the process and then re-initiate it?

Also, the error displayed on the screen is saying "Can not find directory [A "
or something similar along those lines, and it's never the same error.

     Thanks for any hints.

PS I run Xitami 2.5 on Win 2k Pro where this happens.
I would assume it reacts the same under 2003 Server and XP

Thanks I'll try changing the settings for this.
I run the Xitami in console mode though and not as a service.
I'll go check what it looks like.

True indeed Marc, but you know, clients want... and they want more after 
that :)
Maybe I'll have to get clients who only have my site designs, then I can 
control it better but that's a bit hard.
I have to find a nice middle way somehow.

Check that there are no entries pointing to non-existing directories or 
files (for instance default.cfg points to a non-existing virtual host cfg 
file).

Normally Xitami reads the config file each 60 seconds (main config screen) 
so i don't see the need for restarting the server, only activate any change 
much faster.

I wrote my own cgi to restart completely the computer (in some cases when 
some badly written cgi didn't terminate normally), but i never had to 
restart Xitami.

It looks like... just nothing.
Services don't interracy with the desktop.
However, services are started before a user logs on.
The service version should be more robust than the console version: it's 
worth a try-out.

That is not a problem in it self.
It's just a very odd effect it has.
When I'm right next to the machine and double click the icon or use the 
RUNAS batch file to start it, it runs just fine.
There are no directories missing as is indicated, but it still returns that 
response, but only when I execute the restart from the admin page.

I guess I need to get more patient with my machines here ;)

I got one of those too :)
They do come in handy and it's truly amusing seeing someone at the client 
machine viewing our visitors puter, and I execute the reset code from my desk.

Wondering here, is it possible to re-use the environment completely and 
simply rename the current exe file to allow the service version to run instead?
Or do I have to re-install the entire Xitami setup to see if it will fix 
the bugs?

Well here's another glitch then.
I tried first to run the xigui as a service by starting it with the RUNAS 
cmd line.
That worked fine.

What I noticed is I secured it a little bit to good and Xitami didn't even 
get permissions to work as a FTP server and hence, I could not update the 
files, only view the present contents.
It could be because I set all accounts except the main one to not have read 
or write permissions on the C drive :)

Secondly, I had to kill the process and start the GUI again to get it back. 
Not a problem so far.

I added one more domain and logged in through FTP about 3 hours later.
It wouldn't let me because the 60 second auto refresh of the config files 
didn't take.
So I had to terminate the GUI again and double click the icon to start it 
up once more.
That did it.

I'll try to find a work around for it but in the meantime a fix from the 
source side of it might be in place since it doesn't auto update every 60 
seconds.

Thanks for reading.

I am back running Xitami as Admin which is bad I know.

Even so, when I have defined a CGI bin folder on my VHOST site, it should 
be able to execute the file, right?
I keep getting one constant error and I can't find why it is giving me this.

"Bad request: probably tried to POST a non-executable URL."

The very same CGI works just fine as long I run it on the main/default 
domain on the same server.

The config file for this domain specifies...
and yes its linked correctly because the site works

For security purposes removed the real domain name below and simply specify 
THEDOMAINCOM in its place.

[Server]
     Cache-defaults = "0"
     Cgi-bin = "D:\\WWWUSR\\THEDOMAINCOM\\cgi"
     Hostname = "www.THEDOMAIN.com"
     Webpages = "D:\\WWWUSR\\THEDOMAINCOM\\html"

It is not because the propagation of the domain is not done yet and the 
server is looking for www.THEDOMAIN.com as default dynamic re-director!
I tried that already on a completely different and properly configured 
domain and no CGI bin in VHosts appear to work.

Nope... so I finally found it.

In the default.cfg it specifies use /CGI-BIN/ before all CGI's.

In other words, if you specify the exact path instead of the CGI-BIN path 
name, you will try to execute a non executable path according to Xitami.
However, it still does work but only on the default domain. This glitch or 
hick-up only affects Virtually Hosted domains which do NOT allow 
/cgi/PathTo.Exe

In other word's a little twitched to get used to, however now at least 
no-one can just by displaying your source code find your CGI bin.
The have to execute it first so if your CGI directory was named 
/InMommysAttic/ you would still call it by specifying /CGI-BIN/.

     Just a hint if someone wonders.
     No need to respond to me about this.

Unpack the service version in the same directory as Xitami.
If you followed the rules and didn't change xitami.cfg but created a default.cfg file, the console executables and config files will be replaced with the new files. Since the actual configuration is done in default.cfg and this file is not included in the distribution, your config will not be lost.
Don't forget to stop the application before the change.

Thanks for the help and advise.
I only changed a minor entry but as soon I made the VHost, the first one 
using the interface included, the default.cfg was created in it's place so 
I guess I should be fine.

Ok guys... one step closer to the sorting out all of the nasty bits, odds 
and ends. Many asked before me, I'm sure, if we can run ASP on Xitami 
without having to hassle through IIS and ASP.DLL and so forth. Everyone 
here surely knows that VBScript and VBS for Applications is the root to ASP 
3.0 Now, many also say, Yes we can if you pay this and that much for a 
parser. Well... we're one step closer to the FREE way of doing it. At least 
it seems to work on my Win 2000 Pro box with nothing but Windows Script 
Engine 5.6 freely available from MS web site. Download and install the 
Scipting engine, unless you already have it. ----------- Add the following

Works great when using IE. I also tried it with Netscape and Mozilla and it
didn't work on a Win2k pro machine. I haven't done any programming with ASP
because of it not being supported with Xitami (my prefered web server) I
plan to now.

In doing a search concerning ASP not working with Netscape and Mozilla what
I am finding is that it is more of a coding issue on the page. As you all
probably already know, Netscape and Mozilla are a lot less forgiving than IE
when it comes to coding.

To Scott and Ron and all others.
Here's a little hint to all about ASP and VBS.

The nasty part about VBS is that you must specify the " Script 
Language="VBScript"  "
in the beginning of the document to start of the script.

By experience, if you omit this part, while being on a IIS server, then it 
will work in ALL browser, including Netscape, Mozilla and Opera.

They dont tell you that when you start working on it. But this is due to 
the close relative relation between ASP and VBS that allows the code mostly 
to work as ASP in those cases.
This does require that you have ASP supported though, which is something I 
am still trying to find a way to do completely in this.

Further more, when it comes to the great little Norwegian browser, Opera, 
in your settings go and specify that the browser should identify itself as 
MSIE 6, then it should work.

;)

Hello,  

I experinced the same problem with the RESTART button, BUT ONLY with the RESTART button
in the upper right corner. I used the RESTART button from the MAIN ADMIN page and with this one 
I haven't had a problem yet. The server starts every time just fine.
 Xitami 2.5 with xisrv as service on NT4. The only thing I noticed is, that reading every 60 
seconds of the config files is not proper working.

Halo Johannes.
Ich glaube, wie Sie hier geschrieben habe, es nur ein Problem in der=20
"normale" version von Xitami ist.
H=F6cht wahrscheinlich, wird es keine Probleme geben wenn ich der "Service"=
=20
dahrstellung installiere.
Ausser dem, es k=F6nnte schon so sein das ich solche probleme erleben weil=
=20
ich manuelle neue Webseiten
in die cfg eintragen, und denn den Server mit dem web interface wieder=20
aufstarten will.
Es sieht so aus wie ob Xitami nicht aller neue cfg's findet wenn ich darein=
=20
shaust.

     Bet my grammar still stinks in German but hey, ...
     so for the English version... :)

I believe it's only a problem when running the Console (std) version of=20
Xitami. It will probably resolve
itself once I get it installed as an NT service instead. It could also be=20
because I am trying to edit
cfg files manually and then use the web interface for restarting the=20
application. It seems the Xitami
web interface doesn't pick up on all newly added cfg files.

thank you jacob
for taking the time to reply
 
while viewing the router's incoming log-table, i can clearly see inbound traffic reaching xitami on port-80 as expected.  while viewing the router's outgoing log-table however, it appears that xitami makes use of a very wide range of random outgoing ports, while transmitting it's response to corresponding ip-addresses.
 
since installing some proper router-log capture and viewing software, it's now very clear to see that i was confusing xitami's http-transmission port, with the outgoing service-ports which are logged by the router.  though i did not believe you at first jacob, the new software clearly indicates that xitami is indeed transmitting on port-80 like you said it was.
 
i now have a second question which does not pertain to xitami, but i feel that someone in this forum should be able to assist:
 
this router-logging software (obtained from the router manufacturer) is very basic, and offers very little flexibility for tweaking user-options and comfort settings.  it simply loads at start-up, maximized in a 'normal window', and begins capturing log-data from the router.  closing the window [x], minimizes this tiny utility to the system-tray... where it belongs.
 
i would like to edit the run-key to have this utility load hidden, and directly to the system-tray, but cannot seem to find the correct command-suffix for the task.  i would kindly appreciate any information which may assist me with editing this run-key correctly.  thank you.

Of course it doesn't: that's because what MRJ have put out is a simple
HTML page (in their Test) that happens to contain <SCRIPT> tags
specifying the use of VBScript language --- on the CLIENT machine.

The whole concept of ASP is that the embedded VBScript is executed on the
SERVER.

Keep such parochial languages to the server end alone; at least
Javascript/ECMAScript/JScript is universally supported by browsers at the
client end.

ASP on a server does nothing that other server-side scripting such as
Perl or REXX can achieve.  To persist in the search for a Holy Grail
merely reinforces Redmond's attempted monopolistic tendencies.

I have to agree somewhat, this is not ASP running. However it did give me an
idea. What I tried to do was install IIS on my win2k pro PC running Xitami
except put IIS on a different port. That way it would install ASP.dll. (I
don't know any other way to get ASP.dll installed) Once I have this up and
running on Personal Web Server (IIS) on say port 8181, then I would need to
try to get Xitami to recognize it. I have also found other versions of ASP.
One is Chili something or other from Sun, iASP. If you have an idea on how
Xitami could us the ASP.dll let me know.

Reason I would like this to work is because there are a lot of people
wanting to use ASP. And this could open up a lot more doors.

I don't agree.

There are solutions out there that are just as good, if not better than ASP.

Perl, PHP, Python, REXX just to name a few. All are free, all come with 
excellent support. They are all also cross-platform compatible. ASP is 
not, it is a solution from a single vendor for a single platform.

Xitami is ran on many more platforms than just Windows. If we are going 
to discuss solutions that we want to apply to all, then let ASP die.

I would highly suspect that using ASP.DLL in conjunction with any other 
product besides IIS violates the licensing agreement that Microsoft 
implicitly makes you agree to when you install IIS.

I use a lot of PHP, some Perl, and Javascript. Since a version of IIS, which
includes ASP comes with Windows 2000 Pro and Microsoft allows you to install
it and other other programs then I find it hard to believe that they would
let you use everything else as long as it's not ASP. They have been through
all those lawsuits before. Personally I would rather use PHP, I like it and
prefer it. I just figured adding one more feature to the ole toolbelt would
be good. As it sits I can do everything with Xitami that I want to do except
ASP. Where as some of the other products can do everything including ASP.
Don't get me wrong I'm not about to give my my Xitami for one of these other
products. It's just a great many of your high level web designers are using
ASP and getting Xitami to do ASP I think would then blow the competition out
of the water.

Just my opinion.

Ron

Subject: [Xitami] htm html
Message-ID: <20041018023727.8A173C00.proudneck@yahoo.es>

Hi:

Sorry if I repeat this again but i found that in the docs says:


********************************
Building Multilanguage Web Sites

Xitami accepts the HTTP Accept-Language field and tries to do something 
useful with it. Not all browsers let you set this field, but some do. 
This field lets users specify their preferences for particular versions 
of documents. For instance, if a user specifies that they prefer 
documents in French, then English, the Accept-Language field will 
contain "fr, en". Xitami handles this as follows, for a document URL "
file.htm":

    * If the file "file.htm" exists and is readable, Xitami returns it 
to the browser as usual.
    * If the file does not exist, Xitami will search for "file.html", "
file.htm.fr", "file.htm_fr", "file.html.fr", "file.html_fr", "file.htm.
en", "file.htm_en", "file.html.en", and "file.html_en" in that order.
    * If the file is still not found, Xitami returns a 404 error status.
 

The same applies to default pages and to CGI scripts, and filters. Note 
that Xitami will only do the extra checking for alternative htm/html 
files for .htm and .html files. 
********************************


But don't say if is possible to configure it, so, can't be possible 
what i said in my first post?



MY FIRST POST WAS THIS:
=========
Hi:

I'm new to the list. I checked some months back if the answer is 
somewhere but ... a lot of months and only I have a life :/

Well as the subject says it's about htm and html files: Is there a way 
to make xitami treat them different?

Here in example:
I have a site with a file named xxx.html.
I have another file with a link to xxx.htm (no html).
I click the link in this file that points xxx.htm.

Why Xitami route you to the xxx.html file intead the xxx.htm? That no 
exists so it would display a 404 error... but no, it doesn't, it routes 
you to the other file.

And now, testing... I don't know why, with some .htm promts you to save 
them instead route you .html or 404 error. I changed mime, but i 
restored again...

So, any help?

Thanks.

Of course it's not ASP.
It's VBS... then again as Ron is saying here, this is the idea I got too 
but I have not found a way to get the ASP.DLL to react to it yet.
I have the IIS running on port 79 for this purpose and the Xitami on 80. 
Same Idea, lets hope we find the right approach for it.

And in response to the Holy Grail issue, it is simply a question about 
finding a way to reuse three years worth of work that is already integrated 
to many pages written in the past.
Why should I force many people to learn something new and limiting the 
ability of serving something that they would like to use.

Personally I am not to interested in paying for a conversion when I have 
IIS in the worst case scenario and I might as well run it straight out of 
the box.
The old ChilliSoft is some $500 dollars last I looked.

Lets hope one of us finds the solution and posts it in here.

Here's one solution to make this work in Xitami and ASP and this time I 
mean PURE ASP.
It has ONE drawback and that is you have to specify a port number in the URL.
=================================================================================
1) Install Xitami and all things as you like them set up.
Now go back to the installation disk for Windows 2K, 2k3 or selected flavor.

2) Install IIS 5 or 6 of your choice.

3) Enable ASP pages and set permissions to enable ASP to execute as needed.
Script permissions with read permissions.

4) Now set IIS to open on Port 79 and specify the home page directory to be 
your Xitami/webpages/ directory

5) Point ASP queries to Yourdomain.com:79/YourPage.asp and voila'... it 
works :)
=================================================================================
I'll keep tricking this thing until I get it to run without ASP... oh and

I dont personally believe there is something wrong with PERL, PHP or 
anything else,
  so I would appreciate the same courtesy in return regarding ASP.

Only because I don't use Linux, doesn't mean I will imply or propose to let 
Linux die.
I am sure it has it's purpose somewhere in the midst of things. It just 
doesn't solve my clients problems.

You surely don't seriously believe what you've just written?  IME, the
programming skills of those writing ASP is absolutely *dire* (which,
frankly, is exactly what I would have expected).  They are most certainly
NOT "high level web designers".  Script kiddies would be closer to the
mark.  To my mind, code written in ASP is reminiscent of Dr Johnson's
dog:

    A woman's preaching is like a dog's walking on its hinder legs.  It
    is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.

At least programming in a real language, rather than a cut-down and
bastardized "Visual Basic", does result in people using their brains.

As I said earlier, ASP offers *nothing* that cannot be achieved in other
freely-available languages.

I agree with you on the last line in this but... oh well... why don't we 
simply agree
that some flavors of various languages are not for everyone and some prefer 
to use
the write-only PERL and so forth.

I find it of little interest to hear that one language is useless, and if 
so, why are so
many using it, for whatever purpose it may be at which ever level it may be.

I would like to see more Cobol samples available too, and people laugh 
their heads off,
however when it came down to it, in 1999 Cobol programmers where paid 
masses to
fix the glitches written in Y2K resolutions.

Hence, one thing may seem obsolete to one, but be imperative to another.
Just please bare with us that we are NOT trying to force YOU personally to 
use ASP
any time soon, nor any time at all.

We are only looking for a way to provide the ABILITY for those who wish to 
do so and we
can very well do so without further negativity in this matter.

As I just have proven, however with a minor hick-up of port number 
specifications,
it clearly CAN and WILL be done by SOME and NOT by all.

Why in heavens name are you getting so upset?
Are you afraid to many people will find out how to do it and we'll get to many
newbie users in on the forum or what? Just let evolution and such have its 
way and
I'm sure most will eventually port over to a stronger scripting language.

Personally I noticed I could do without ASP by simply including 4 more 
lines in my CGI's.
That in it self does not imply that I will deny anyone else the right and 
ability to do whatever
they please to in their own environments.

Anyway, that's my two cents, and yes, I do write some pretty nice code 
sometimes, and not all the time.
If being a programmer or whatever implies a innate need to display hubris 
over the selected code environment,
then I will resign tomorrow morning. Why? Simple, it furthers nothing and 
brings nothing new to the table.

     To each their own, and so on...

Thanks for the word, and I will not say anything about ASP in Xitami
anymore as it appears to raise to many hot tempers.

     MRJ.

You are just running parallell web servers. This is nothing new, and 
in fact, you have not managed to get ASP running on Xitami. The only 
benefit of this setup (over an all-IIS approach) is higher 
performance for static documents served by Xitami and that benefit is 
easily outweighed by the numerous disadvantages (coding hassles 
keeping track of different servers -- absolute links are needed, no 
unified search).

Frankly, this discussion doesn't even belong on the Xitami list. If 
you managed to get ASP running as a CGI filter, that's another thing.

Maybe there's a way to run IIS internally without letting open ports to the
internet (e.g. running in another machine in the LAN or closing IIS port to
the world via firewall rules), then making xitami asking pages to iis
trasparently (via some proxying script, or cgi, or lrwp, or anything else)
then simply copying the response to the client. This way you surely have to
have both servers to run, but it could be a good way to migrate to anything
better than ASP, starting using what you just have (3 years of works as I
understand), then translating a little bit at a time in the new language (if
you want to migrate).

But if you don't want to migrate I think the solution is to get locked to
IIS... ASP is born for IIS and viceversa... so why using two tools that
speak different languages (xitami and asp), that will only put some other
software that in the best will slow down your site, in the worst will mess
your life up with security and complexity.

Yes, you could easily do this in PHP for example. That would also 
masquerade most of the IIS security problems :-P But you would also 
get the worst of both worlds -- Xitami's bad (or rather, 
"traditional") CGI performance (latency in the process creation), 
plus execution time on the internal IIS.

What I wonder is if you can use IIS to enable ASP then turn off the IIS, not
remove it but just stop it. I am not sure if ASP will keep working or not
and if you can call the asp.dll from Xitami. I'm sure there has got to be a
way but it's way over my head. So what did Chilisoft do, did they just write
their own ASP engine/dll?

Hi All

ASP is a server side DHTML. This means any scripting in any laungh (vbs, 
js, php) ran by a ASP page runs @ the server not the client so html client 
(IE, Netscape, ect.) dose not mater because they never see the script to 
run it. Xitami runs asp as plane DHTML whitch runs on the client not the 
server. So if you use vbs or js as your scripting laungh use the 
runatserver command.

Here's one solution to make this work in Xitami and ASP and this time I
mean PURE ASP.
It has ONE drawback and that is you have to specify a port number in the
URL.
============================================================================
=====
1) Install Xitami and all things as you like them set up.
Now go back to the installation disk for Windows 2K, 2k3 or selected flavor.

2) Install IIS 5 or 6 of your choice.

3) Enable ASP pages and set permissions to enable ASP to execute as needed.
Script permissions with read permissions.

4) Now set IIS to open on Port 79 and specify the home page directory to be
your Xitami/webpages/ directory

5) Point ASP queries to Yourdomain.com:79/YourPage.asp and voila'... it
works :)
============================================================================
=====
I'll keep tricking this thing until I get it to run without ASP... oh and

I dont personally believe there is something wrong with PERL, PHP or

Only because I don't use Linux, doesn't mean I will imply or propose to let
Linux die.
I am sure it has it's purpose somewhere in the midst of things. It just
doesn't solve my clients problems.

Check the console.log for error messages; if in doubt run the console version 
of Xitami, which will print the error message on the screen.  Most likely you 
have either changed a configuration file, a network connection has been 
reset, or something unfortunate has happened to your file system.

OK then.  What is needed is a way to process a document that's written in
ASP (with all its little embedded bits of <% %>) and massage that into a
"plain" HTML document.

Hmm, sounds like one would need the following:
    Route the .asp file to a filter, running as a CGI program
    Let the filter parse the ASP, performing appropriate substitutions
        for the ASP bits; this in turn would require one to
    Install VBS locally on the server, so that it can act upon the chunks
        of VBS thrown at it by the CGI parser.
    
Ought not to be too difficult (but would probably run like a dog).

There was another company apart from Chillisoft that had an ASP plug-in
for Xitami; I tried it out about four years ago because I thought that it
might be useful for a class that we teach.  However, at that time, the
VB that it handled wasn't up-to-speed on things like the Session Object,
and we were forced to continue using IIS for that class.

Is anyone using Blat in a Win32 environment?

I am trying to email the contents of a web based form. I have the latest
versions of Blat, PHP and Perl installed. I am just clueless as to how to
accomplish this. If anyone has an example they could let me use, I would
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks!

I too ended up in the filter section, tried this
 .asp=e:\win2k\system32\inetserv E:\WIN2K\system32\inetsrv\asp.dll
Just by chance, Nope it has to be an exe file I guess.

But I'm close, the server recognizes that it is a asp file and returns an
error.

Internal error: your request was unsuccessful

OK then.  What is needed is a way to process a document that's written in
ASP (with all its little embedded bits of <% %>) and massage that into a
"plain" HTML document.

Hmm, sounds like one would need the following:
    Route the .asp file to a filter, running as a CGI program
    Let the filter parse the ASP, performing appropriate substitutions
        for the ASP bits; this in turn would require one to
    Install VBS locally on the server, so that it can act upon the chunks
        of VBS thrown at it by the CGI parser.

Ought not to be too difficult (but would probably run like a dog).

for Xitami; I tried it out about four years ago because I thought that it

I used Blat some time ago. Very fine program, but after all not well suited 
for a web application. It could not handle all the borderline conditions 
that could happen.
I ended using a mail server (Mercury from www.pamail.com). It's free, and 
acts like a real mail server, taking care of all error conditions. Of 
course there is some configuration to do, but once it's running, it's worth 
the time used for the configuration. You can the use it is a local mail 
server and you can also access it from the internet.
Mercury is very modular, so you need only to install the modules you need:
- core module
- smtp client (to send out mail)
- pop server (to be able to read the failed mails).

Mercury has a mail drop facility (like most mail servers). Just drop a 
correctly configured message in a special folder and Mercury will pick it 
up and mail it automatically.

Advantages:
- no need to start Blat for each message to send
- asynchronous: the web application can continue it's job, all the mail 
processing is done by Mercury
- no need to take care of transient error conditions (receiver mail server 
offline, ...)

Disadvantages:
- does not handle encoding of attachments: you must provide the final message

Would be an excellent place to start. You might also consider joining 
the mailing list for Blat. The developers (most of us that have 
contributed to the project) are alive and well there.

Here's a hint perhaps to solving mailing in Winodws.

I solved the mailing issues by adding MailEnable Standard to a Windows box.
Strong advantage: 1) It's Free 2) It is a fully functional mail server for 
Windows
3) Why think of formatting messages when its done by the server and it 
handles all security,
relay blocks and more after a minor setup period of about an hour.

You can check it out at www.mailenable.com and help is but a forum post 
away in http://forum.mailenable.com
In fact it works great on the same box as Xitami too.

HELP HELP HELP

recently, i don't know why either, i've been receiving hits to my
xitami
server and it seems for the purpose of crashing it. i mean these hits
are
coming in by the second. usually at hit 861, service will freeze
win98se sith blue screen. i am using xitami v 2.4d9 on win98se (don't
laugh). i am wondering has anyone figured out a script that will
reset xitami hits automatically, to counter the malicious hits coming
through? 

[p.s. - i have downloaded 2.5c2 from xitami.com but did not see the
install file. i'm so busy on other projects, i can't get it to work
right now.] 

thanks. ~

in words & deeds, PEACE 
all ways          always

Hello Merilene,

ProtoNova has a really good anti-Denial of Service architecture built
into
the server.  Xitami can't counter these attacks except at the IP
level
(meaning you have to be awake manning the server).  ProtoNova can
automatically detect a DoS and stop it (even while you sleep).  You
can do
Xitami-style IP mask blocking as well, but you could be blocking
legitimate
IPs.  The anti-DoS architecture's default settings aren't perfect,
but ever
since it went in place, no one using ProtoNova has had a problem.

I'm afraid "resetting the hits" has nothing to do with it.

It's hard to say if the BSOD you are seeing is a result of Xitami or 
the Windows TCP/IP stack hanging. I suspect the latter -- Xitami 
never crashes for me and I have way more hits than that. The sad 
truth is that 9x-based systems aren't made for this kind of work. 
It's not even worth the time to investigate where the problem lies. 
My advice would be to pick up a cheap copy of NT4 Workstation or 
Windows 2000 Professional and upgrade your operating system. They 
aren't impervious to DOS attacks at the TCP level, especially not 
NT4, but they can be configured to behave more rudely to DOSers, and 
you can set watchdogs restarting the Xitami service even if it 
crashes. Plus Xitami crashing won't bring the system down.

Message-ID: <5d61b757041025065741b042d7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have an issue with Xitami/Pro v2.4c3 running on a Win2K server that
I am hoping someone may have a solution to.

If I password protect a directory, and access it using HTTP, I can
access the directory without a problem.  However, if I access the
directory with HTTPS, it does not seem to recognize my user id and
password combination.

Has anyone else had this issue and solved it?  If so, could you give
me some assistance?

Cheers,

Steve

I have my W2k Pro running with Xitami for some years without
a problem. I only restarted the pc because of work i was doing. Never
crashed.
In that pc i also have a Mail Server(SMTP+POP3+WEB) and FTP.
Everything protected by a firewall (Winroute).
I agree you should drop W9x versions and get W2k pro (forget NT) and
get the security patches/service packs.
Xitami should be instaled as a service.

I ran the same combination for 4 years with no major problems. Never had a blue
screen caused by Xitami even with many attacks. I often got thousands of hits a
day on that system. :)

Look in the log folder C:\Xitami\Logs  You will find ac------.log & an
er------.log.  ------ being the date. These files can be opened with notepad &
will tell you what is causing the problem. 

The log file should show if there were any dos requests.
The error file should tell you what happened at that time.

IMO, the win98se crash could have been caused by to many users at one time for
your system to handle. I believe the default number of users for that version of
Xitami is 10 & that may be to many for your system. Try resetting defaults.cfg 
[Server]
    Limit = "10"  to 5 & see if you still have problems

The number of hits doesn't make any difference. The problem is when there are to
many people trying to get into your computer at the same time.

Just unzip it to a new folder in C:\Xitami252 & copy the existing website folder
the new folder. When you are sure you have everything working you can remove the
old version.

I get lockups almost daily, just sitting there running the webserver. I even
bought a auto rebooter for when it stops responding for 3 minutes it will
reboot the machine. I've wondered if it might be a hardware problem and I
think you answered that for me as YES! I suspect I may have a bad memory
module but had to rule out software TCP/IP and Xitami hits.

Ask a hardware guy and he will say it's a software problem, ask a software

Just to throw in two bits more for you to contemplate. I had an SE box for
an intranet app in an office once. Had some crash problems occasionally,
only needed a reboot to fix the problem, did not happen very often. The
cause seemed to be SE's inablity to release memory, so may need to research
ways to optimize the ram for the op system. And don't let them tell you that
SE is a bad os, just and older one, one that had a very good rep during it's
time.

Belarc Advisor can probably answer your hardware vs. software question.
http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html

I have been both a hardware & software guy since the late 70's & I learned with
a M$ OS it is best to look at software conflicts first & then look for hardware
problems.

Xitami will try to serve up all page requests & the only time it will cause a
problem is if it tries to serve more pages at a time than the OS can handle. 

If you are having crashes with just Xitami running make sure windows isn't
running something else in the background & decrease the number of connections
Xitami will serve.

XP has the same problem on memory releases as 9X does and so does Win 2000.

You will see after running XP for a longer period of time that the OS may 
be using 250 Mb memory on a large machine.
Also, it will NOT help to add more RAM as the memory specifications are 
more or less false as provided from M$

98 Should run best with up to 256 Mb RAM, try 128 and it's smoother
WIn 2000 specifies 1 Gb max but will not run properly or fast enough unless 
you use 512 Mb max.

Windows XP specifies a max limit of 4 Gb but actually runs faster on 2 Gb. 
Even so you could pull it down to 1 Gb and get a stable result because most 
processes will never even touch the upper or second chip.

Will be fun to see how they resolve this in Longhorn which will require 100 
GB hdd and 1 Gb ram to even run, plus all other hardware has to be 
digitally signed for it to run. At least as they specified it for the 4074 
release.

I run Xitami on Win 2 K and serve about 800-1000 Mb per day at well over 
10-20 000 hits and it seems stable.
The only trouble was resetting the server to get it to refresh the cfg 
files. But that's resolved by a simple & free remote VNC controller from my 
desktop.
In addition I run DNS, FTP, HTTP and Mail from the same box too.

No, the NT, 2k, and XP stacks are all robust. Well, maybe spare the 
original NT 3.1 stack, but if you are running THAT you have bigger 
problems than the stack, I'll tell you.

I've never had a problem on any of those OSes you mentioned and I run
month-long processes that _intentionally_ chew 100% CPU and 500MB+ RAM.
So, the behavior you are seeing is some program or system driver with a
memory leak, not Windows and could be Xitami for all anyone knows
(ProtoNova is guaranteed to be memory leak-free at the application level).
When Windows starts swapping out memory, Task Manager won't reflect the
true numbers, but I can guarantee you that your so-called leaks have
nothing to do with Windows itself given the rigorous tests I've put it
through and my general system uptime (months on end with downtime only to
reboot after applying security updates).

RAM isn't a problem.  CPU availability is the problem.  Hyperthreaded CPUs

true dual-procs will do slightly better than hyperthreaded.

Digital signatures are only going to be checked once...during boot.  And
the drivers are signed, not the hardware.  And the numbers most people
heard were pulled out of thin air to just to sound impressive more than
anything else (a marketing ploy you and most other people fell for).  MSDN
Subscribers will get more realistic numbers when the real beta comes out
mid-2005 for those with at least MSDN Enterprise subscriptions.  Just to
nitpick.

It seems to be, until people start serving up dynamic content or use the
built-in FTP server.  I personally never had a problem with static content.
 Of course, that doesn't say much.  I never had a problem with Apache with
static content either.

ProtoNova detects configuration changes and dynamically adapts to the

Could be but I have tested this pretty well with every config I could on 
some processes easily running 100% CPU.
I have also tried with both hyper and single threaded CPU's and all levels 
from 128 - 4 Gb RAM.

>When Windows starts swapping out memory

If it does LOL
As far I know Windows Explorer.exe should not require 225 Mb Ram at any one 
time on a prescot chip.

The biggest problem I've had was 4GB RAM on a Prescot 2,8 GHz hyperthreaded.
I had to basically strip out 2 GB ram and stop using certain small tools 
that work fine on all my other machines.
I do run 7 different configs at the time being. All from CD-Based Knoppix 
to XP, 2K3 Server and 2k pro
Only Windows with Xitami yet though.

I run 50/50 static and dynamic content mainly through CGI's I make myself.
Also I constantly use both he FTP functions and remote controlled 
environments as needed without any problems so far in Xitami 2.5.

Ok so here's a somewhat stupid question or maybe I just need more sleep.

Assume: the base host domain name is MYDOMAIN.COM

Now by default all hits on www.mydomain.com, mydomain.com and 
anything.mydomain.com will hit the base host.

I also run several VHosted domains with different domain names.

I specify a cfg and aut file for a VHost path to a different directory now 
say we call the directory D:\OTHER\

I want to set other.mydomain.com to go in this directory only and not to the
basehost but whatever I try keeps being bumped into the basehost root path.

I have also specified it under the Virtual Hosts section in the default.cfg 
to no avail.
And I also pointed to the correct path where I keep the cfg and aut files 
for this cname header.

Does anyone have an idea/solution to this?


   Thanks in advance

You would need different IP addresses for each of the 'other' vhost folders to
be considered different places. 

Xitami is small enough you could run a different site each with it's own VHost
name on different ports. 
IE: 
Register ipaddress:80 for main, ipadress:8080 for vhost1 & using different ports
for each vhost site.

Or just do like the big guys (& the rest of us) do & put each site at
maindomain/~vhost for each different site. Which is a lot easier.

You have to build a file "other.cfg" and set in defaults.cfg the line:

[Virtual-hosts]
    other.mydomain.com = "drive:\\dir\\other.cfg"

I run my own DNS server on the same machine which resolves different domains
to different IP addresses. A good easy to use DNS server is DNS Plus and if
you are on a dynamic IP you can use DNS2GO.com or 2myDNS.com. So as my ISP
changes my IP, daily I might add, DNS2GO and 2MYDSN update their DNS Server
for my new IP Address. So if someone enters www.mydomain.com, or
www.myotherdomain.com or 123.mydomain.com. it will naturally go to the IP
address of my computer. Now what does my computer do with it. That's where
DNS Plus takes that domain name and resolves it to an internal IP which
Windows 2000 Pro can have hundreds of virtial IPs. So it goes like this.

Enter www.mydomain.com > 2MYDNS.com says go to my PC at 200.111.222.111 >
DNSPlus gets it and says go to 192.168.1.12 > which my Xitami default.cfg
says this 192.168.1.12 = "mydomain.cfg" and thus viola the www.mydomain.com
index.html page displays.

If someone enters 123.mydomain.com then DNSPlus may send it to 192.168.1.13
which the Xitami default.cfg says 192.168.1.13 = "123mydomain.cfg"

I know there are other ways to do this but this works well for me. I can
host many VHosts.

Windows does start swapping after following its rules about when to use
swap space:

1)  When the Available memory goes to nil, start using system cache.
2)  When the system cache goes to nil, swap out memory of existing
processes to the hard drive to recover the system cache.
3)  Repeat step #2 until allowed to resume with #1.

Obviously, Windows isn't being terribly smart when to use swap.

Your case, however, seems really odd.  Explorer.exe loads in a ton of junk
at boot, when you first right-click, etc.  Try running Process Explorer to
see what DLLs are loaded in, and, IIRC, it also gives you the amount of
memory each one is using.  If it does, it will be a rough estimate, but
good enough to find the trouble DLL.  Explorer.exe doesn't do much - what
it loads, however, could do a lot - that's why a lot of trojans/etc. love
explorer.exe - they can hide inside the EXE and not be seen from Task Manager.

The only problem is, I don't know where else it is acceptable to discuss
ProtoNova with users who might be considering another web server other than
those lists that such users are subscribed to.  Put yourself in my shoes
and what would you be doing?

Of course I could be going about this all the wrong way and you know of a
better method that I am obviously missing that draws me some more business.
 It would be really helpful to give me some very specific places to go to
on the Internet where people _want_ to hear about such things.

At any rate, all mentions of ProtoNova will disappear off this list.  I
might stick around to help with Xitami-related issues, but will remove the
ProtoNova "ads" from even my signature if and when I do.  As it is, I have
effectively figured out how to alienate myself from you and other people on
this list and for that I'm sorry and regret what I've done.  I have learned
a few things through this experience.  I hope you'll find it in you
somewhere to forgive the damage I caused.

I already do this. I run 20 domains out of one box on one IP.

I have different domain names specified in the Vhost section done.
That works fine as long as the domain name is different.

when I add a CNAME named OTHER to the OTHER.MYDOMAIN.COM

then OTHER.MYDOMAIN.COM and MYDOMAIN.COM still go to the same site.
They shouldn't.

I already have a other.cfg, other.aut, default.cfg is made aware of them
and it still does not work but it works if I use
www.mynextdomain.com then it's found properly for any other domain with 
it's own host files in DNS and so on.

Of course I should not have to specify a zone file in DNS to get xitami to 
route the traffic to the correct location path.

Hence I need to get the other.mydomain.com to get a site of its own just 
like www.mynextdomain.com right next to www.mydomain.com

All you said to do I already tried and it doesn't want to get in there.
I don't really want to start specifying port numbers to clients.
They become easily confused as it is.

In my experience, the single biggest source of hardware failures similar to
the one you've described has to do with pin connection types.  What I'm
referring to here is mixing metals and letting them oxidize in the
computer.  It may seem minor, but memory and motherboard manufacturers
publish lead types (gold vs. tin) for this very reason.  If you mix gold
contact memory with a tin contact motherboard, it will work fine for about
6-12 months before the occassional and very random blue-screen starts
showing up.  About 3-4 years down the road, the PC becomes almost unusable.
 Basically, this is your typical nasty chemical reaction that requires you
to replace both motherboard and memory chips to correct the problem.  Most
computer makers know about this and make sure built PCs match pin types -
unless they are trying to get you to have problems and become unhappy with
them.

Of course, bad memory modules can cause the problem you are having as well
(but you would have been noticing things from day one of owning the PC).
If you have two sticks, try pulling one and see if that improves the
situation.  If not, substitute the pulled one with the other.  If someone
has the same RAM type as you and their system works (and they are willing
to let you borrow their RAM), try that before spending a chunk of money on
good RAM.

I have set up something like you are asking about.

In the defaults.cfg file, under [Virtual-hosts] I added:
other.mydomain.com = "other.cfg"

In the other.cfg file, under [Server] I added:
Cgi-bin = "c:/Other/cgi-bin"
Webpages = "c:/Other"

You will have to add a zone for other.mydomain.com.

Yep from day one, but it's not usually until the end of the day or in the
middle of the night when the server is hit a lot and the email server is
receiving mega spams. Never got the BSOD just lock ups.

Through what mechanism does this "default" occur?  Can you show us the
DNS entries for this domain of yours (obfuscated as above if you insist,
although better the real ones).  [Use 
    nslookup - ns.dns.provider.com
and then the 
    ls -d > some.file mydomain.com
command to list ALL the RRs for mydomain.com]

UNLESS there ARE DNS entries for the root domain, AND www.mydomain.com,
AND for anything.mydomain.com (in which, if anything is really meant to
be anything, then you'll need an entry for *.mydomain.com), then there is
by no means any "default" that routes the traffic to any one particular
server.

Or did you know all this, and were just being somewhat vague in your
reportage?

I will try later on tonight when it's a little bit less load on this to 
update the secondary dns server too.
I already added the CNAME record to the NS1 on my domain and I will update 
the records with a manual request call tonight.

That should not take more than 1 hour to propagate as the last time 
besides, for testing I point right
into my own DNS server anyway so I'll let you know what happens and how 
this progresses.

    ;) Thanks for the hints and pointers all.

OK, ignore my earlier reply (written Tues am, but only recently
uploaded).  I now understand better what your problem is.

When you add a CNAME RR to your domain, then anything encountering that
record will in turn ask to resolve the IP address for the "canonical
name" to which you've just pointed.  Therefore, by the time the web
browser issues its request, it will have that canonical name in its Host:
header line, and not the original name.

The answer is NOT to use CNAME; instead, provide a separate A record,
pointing to the same IP address as the other host(s); the HTTP request
will now include the original other.mydomain.com in its headers.

> They shouldn't.

They will; that's how CNAMEs work.

<DIV>The only problem is, I don't know where else it is acceptable to dis=
cuss</DIV>
<DIV>ProtoNova with users who might be considering another web server oth=
er than</DIV>
<DIV>those lists that such users are subscribed to.&nbsp;&nbsp;Put yourse=
lf in my shoes</DIV>
<DIV>and what would you be doing?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Of course I could be going about this all the wrong way and you know=
 of a</DIV>
<DIV>better method that I am obviously missing that draws me some more bu=
siness.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; It would be really helpful to give me some very specific plac=
es to go to</DIV>
<DIV>on the Internet where people _want_ to hear about such things.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>At any rate, all mentions of ProtoNova will disappear off this list.=
&nbsp;&nbsp;I</DIV>
<DIV>might stick around to help with Xitami-related issues, but will remo=
ve the</DIV>
<DIV>ProtoNova "ads" from even my signature if and when I do.&nbsp;&nbsp;=
As it is, I have</DIV>
<DIV>effectively figured out how to alienate myself from you and other pe=
ople on</DIV>
<DIV>this list and for that I'm sorry and regret what I've done.&nbsp;&nb=
sp;I have learned</DIV>
<DIV>a few things through this experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you'll find =
it in you</DIV>
<DIV>somewhere to forgive the damage I caused.</DIV>

Ok I will LOL

Hi All
I have been following most of the discussion on Xitami for a while, and =
was wondering does anyone use it commercially. I use Xitami all of the =
time and I hav'nt had any problems, this could be because I use it for =
development (off line) which is how I thought it should be used I found it =
a bit tricky at first to configure but after that it been great.

Yep from day one, but it's not usually until the end of the day or in the
middle of the night when the server is hit a lot and the email server is
receiving mega spams. Never got the BSOD just lock ups.

In my experience, the single biggest source of hardware failures similar =
to
the one you've described has to do with pin connection types.  What I'm
referring to here is mixing metals and letting them oxidize in the
computer.  It may seem minor, but memory and motherboard manufacturers
publish lead types (gold vs. tin) for this very reason.  If you mix gold
contact memory with a tin contact motherboard, it will work fine for about
6-12 months before the occassional and very random blue-screen starts
showing up.  About 3-4 years down the road, the PC becomes almost =
unusable.
 Basically, this is your typical nasty chemical reaction that requires you
to replace both motherboard and memory chips to correct the problem.  Most
computer makers know about this and make sure built PCs match pin types -
unless they are trying to get you to have problems and become unhappy with
them.

Of course, bad memory modules can cause the problem you are having as well
(but you would have been noticing things from day one of owning the PC).
If you have two sticks, try pulling one and see if that improves the
situation.  If not, substitute the pulled one with the other.  If someone
has the same RAM type as you and their system works (and they are willing
to let you borrow their RAM), try that before spending a chunk of money on
good RAM.

Hi folks,

Anyone know what happened to the downloads?  I attempted to download
the latest version and all I got was a 65k file. I tried it from two
different systems.

I have to upgrade because I'm getting those "Can't open schema file
schemas/errors.sch" errors. I noticed Ewen mentioned the need to
upgrade.

Can someone point me to the latest file?

Are you downloading via modem/low speed?

try using a download manager, like getright; it may be an issue that xitami
has with low speed connections

Hello,

I experienced the problem as well. I just started the download again and it worked. I didn't delete 
the old file though. Had no problems then.

Message-ID: <418178AE.4020709@arbor-freight.com>

Like others I've started to experience system crashes lately under W2K 
Pro after months of no problems (changed to 2.4d11 from 2.4d10 in July).

In searching for answers I looked at the access.log file in the log 
directory inside the Xitami directory.  To my surprise I found entry 
lines not only for Xitami but also for both my mail server (SLMail) and 
proxy server (Software602) neither of which are documented to use a file 
access.log.  I've changed defaults.cfg to use acs.log rather than 
access.log as the file name and will follow it for a few days.

Has anyone run into this situation?

I have Xitami 2.5b6 on winXP & have had a few crashes that flag a VBrun error. I
also have had logs showing request for 
GET /cgi-bin/openwebmail/openwebmail.pl
from Arizona & Poland. I don't use webmail so they get a 404 page.

Check the error.log & you should see they got a 404 error.

The data I see are actual log entries for the Mail and Proxy servers and 
in at least one case the actual content of an inbound email.  Two 
guesses on my part are either W2K was messed up and writing to the same 
file for multiple programs or what I'm seeing is what was in all buffers 
and/or caches at the time of a system crash which Xitami appended to at 
restart.  Either way it is strange.

perlssi is in the xitami home directory, and my %PATH% includes C:\perl\bin.

I can find nothing in the FAQ or any other troubleshooting guides
regarding this.

Any help is much appreciated.

Stupid notion on my side perhaps but did you add the ! before the perl path

That is a very good question.  I'm going to find out.  (I didn't
download the source code, as I lack the MSVC compiler)
As to the ! in the path ... not a silly question, but not where the
problem lies.I'm downloading the source now.  Will report back re:
line 570 of xixssi.c

I include the section of code from xixssi.c surrounding line 570. (and
attach the whole file)
I don't know much C,

Also, this is the exact SSI command that causes the failure.
<!--#include file="../cgi-bin/last_post.txt" -->

If I change it to:

<!--#include file="last_post.txt" -->

and make sure the last_post.txt file is located in the webroot
directory, it no longer causes a crash, but it doesn't include the
file.

/*****************************   OPEN SSI FILE   *****************************/

    time_t
        file_time;
        
    tcb = thread-> tcb;                 /*  Point to thread's context        */

    ASSERT (tcb-> file_name);                          <<<-----------

        sprintf (error, "%s is already open", tcb-> file_name);
        raise_exception (command_error_event);
        return;
      }

    tcb-> file = fopen (tcb-> file_name, "rb");
    if (tcb-> file == NULL)
      {
        sprintf (error, "Can't open ssi file %s", tcb-> file_name);
