Assuming that you have the appropriate wildcard CNAME in the DNS for
your domain so that all addresses point to the same place then this
should be as simple as writing a (perl) script to copy a blank virtual
host directory to the one for the name and edit defaults.cfg to add
the new vhost.

In other words it should be trivial with the hardest bit being
controlling who is allowed to create the subdomain and to ensure that
only valid and sensible names are used (at least I assume your client
would prefer it if obscene subdomains were not allowed for example)

yup, you can automate it with cgi or php.  The process can be pretty 
extensive, but ultimately you need to create a forms for the user to fill 
out basic info about the subdomain and then when the form is submitted the 
cgi/php would need to automate all the background scripts to create the 
subdomain.  the scripts would create the directories, all the necessary the 
subdomain .cfg files, add a subdomain line to the defaults.cgf file that 
points/aliases the new subdomian to the appropriate subdomain.cfg files.  
Then after all that is done your cgi/php script would need to reload/restart 
the Xitami service to load the new defaults.cfg file into memory (without a 
service reload the new subdomain would remain unaccessable).

Whats the purpose of creating a blank subdomain though?  Even if you 
automate the subdomain creation process is your client going to develop the 
subdomain website?  If you are creating the subdomain website then it would 
take you two minutes to be able to create the subdomain via dns and xitami.  
If your client can manage to create their own subdomain website then they 
should be able to manage the xitami server too.

Then again, if your client wants to create subdomains for the purpose of 
allowing users to create their own websites then you will need to write a 
very extensive system that tracks users, interfaces with Xitami subdomains, 
deals with subdomain administrators, etc etc etc....and there are premade 
packages out there that already do this and do them well.

You usually don't need to do this but just need to have a low server
refresh time because Xitami reloads its config file absed on this
time.

i.e. in the [Server] section of defaults.cfg put
  Refresh = "1"
so that the server reloads its config every second

Hi Everyone, 
I'm not able to "enable" anonymous HTTP PUT (please note, not FTP PUT) on a single directory.
Is there any way to do this without Xitami asking for username and password?

thank you very much in advance

  See the listed default example for how to add Anonymous as a user and allow users with no password to log in.
  You cannot log in to FTP without having at least a  username, even if you disable the password or leave it as * or blank.

Perl 5.8 complete installation gives the following error when script

-- Can't locate object method "net" via package "stop" --

Was this shorthand for the following?

-- &stop::net( qw(xitami) ); --

no it was a windows CLI command in perl that wpould be

 qx(net stop xitami)

It does work inside backticks but Xitami is not installed as a service
on my system so I can't test whether really it stops.

Hello,

try to download Windows Command line Tool "kill.exe" 
Then try to put two Shell Commands by PHP:

shell("kill xiwin32.exe");
shell("xiwin32.exe");

- or something like this.

First line kills all active tasks of Xitami, the second line starts new Xitami.
Refer to the manual of the kill.exe tool.

Yes but is it safe to kill Xitami just like that whenever you feel like
it? Runing CGIs, open files and all..

Hello,

try to download Windows Command line Tool "kill.exe" 
Then try to put two Shell Commands by PHP:

shell("kill xiwin32.exe");
shell("xiwin32.exe");

- or something like this.

First line kills all active tasks of Xitami, the second line starts new
Xitami.
Refer to the manual of the kill.exe tool.

Hello,

There are lots of different "kill" tools out there. Most of them can be set to different "brutality" levels. First they try to stop the running task by sending a kind of "Alt-F4" command. When the task is still running properly it will react by closing all open files and terminate the regular way. After this, when no reaction, the running .exe can be really "killed" and can be kicked out of memory.

I'm running a scheduled task that is testing the Xitami server every minute by a simple http-Get, and if there is no answer probably Xitami was shot by unknown reason (maybe my own PHP scripts do so by fault). This happens 2-3 times a day to me. After a defect is recognized, Xitami becomes killed and restarted in the way I mentioned. I never found problems when doing so. No problems with open files, even when PHP scrips are called.

This all seems  a bit too complicated for a simple process.

The problem with killing and restarting the service via cgi (and I think 
php) is that when you kill the server you will also kill the process that is 
executing the kill/restart commands.  The kill command will work and will 
stop the service, but now that the service is stopped the cgi will be 
terminated which means the second part of the the perl process, "restart", 
won't get executed simply because the CGI process has already been 
terminated.

I know this is a fact for the CGI process but I am not certain about the 
PHP.  CGI is a engine that runs and execute web based perl scripts.  However 
I think the beauty of PHP is that there is no engine managing php scripts, 
which means if a php script is run via a url, that the php script will load 
into memory and execute even if the webserver is killed in the middle of 
being executed. Someone might be able to elaborate on the PHP process but I 
think thats how PHP works.

Someone else suggested use the "server refresh" feature in the defaults.cfg 
but this means its an automated thing and doesn't give you the ability to do 
it remotely, quickly, etc.  when ever you want.  You need another way of 
executing a perl/php script remotely that isn't done via the URL, or via the 
same webserver.  Maybe run a second web service on a different port that 
simply manages the kill/restart of the first service.

If you look at the /admin page there seems to be a fairly simple way
to cause the server to reset (or halt).

I think you would need to create a perl script with LWP or equivalent
to get (with authentication) http://localhost/admin and then post to
/admin?somemagicstring with post data jsaction=~A47.0 where the
(somemagicstring) is retrieved from the LWP get page.

Writing a server to monitor certain requests and do this when asked is
pretty trivial but I'm not sure you would need to do even that much
because I think the resrat saves the state anyway or queues it so that
it occurs in a safe way

The problem here is that if the server has died, that's not going to work.

What we generally do - on Linux, but the same works on Win32 - is to
monitor the process continuously from a script that runs on the same
box as the server, using wget, and if the server fails to respond
within a second, kill it and then restart it.

Under win32, you can stop/restart the server by using the server
manager (net stop / net start),  but since the net stop command needs
the server to respond, I'd suggest using kill.exe.

You can do this in Perl but it's really not worth it, it's just a few
lines of batch commands.

Pieter, there are I think two separte problems that are trying to be solved

problem one - the one where you recommend using kill.exe is for when
you believe Xitami is dead.

problem two - which is where I'm proposing the perl script is for when
you want to prod Yitami to reload its config because you have
(programatically) added some more VHOSTS or similar. In this case you
know Xitami is actually alive so you don't want to kill it in the
middle of doing something

Xitami will automatically reload its config file when it can, however
it cannot reload its vhost config dynamically, and for this you need
to stop/restart it.  Using the WBA interface is equivalent to doing a
stop/start.

Yes, to do this remotely, you could use the /admin interface and
'click' on the restart button.

For those that care here is the script - obviously change 'username',
'password' to the right values.

Normally you would do the VHOST creation foirst then call this script.
I don't see why you can't do this during the CGI call although I admit
I haven't tested it to see if that works. Leaving this script to run
as a dedicated service is left as an exercise to the student but some
hints can be found in my realplayer controller code

If and as long as you run two processes there is no problem.

1) Your CGI application to execute a call to an application in your server 
machine
2) The Application which is invoked by the CGI.

The CGI is only to send some parameters to the main Application to indicate 
what you want it to do.

A proper set of rules for this would be as follows

    Halt server
    Start Server
    Reboot PC

The fourth optional parameter I am toying with now since I keep having 
problems keeping Xitami alive
since FTP keep hanging up with nasty C errors is a checker that can lay 
dormant in the background
and run a check every 30 seconds to ensure that Xitami is actually up and 
running.

The reboot PC I made into a CGI to force a full system flush at a set time 
every night.
If I miss to log in and run it, It will run itself by the Scheduler to 
force a flush of the system.

Since Xitami can be set to run on boot up, this is not a problem either.

Further more, if your config is ok, and you execute a cgi to reset your 
machine, you can just as
well do this from the cgi if you have another app restarting it again.

I dont see any problems whatsoever with this and in fact wrote my solutions 
in VB 5 to keep it simple fast and practical.

So do you mean that 

- either your CGI either goes directly and reboots the PC if on Win, and
  Xitami is killed/can start up auto after reboot,

- or the perl CGI would say something like:

  exec( halting_and_starting_executable() );

  and the exec'ed process would not self-destroy after Xitami halt
  when Xitami kills all executing CGI's because an exec'ed process is
not 
  a process dependent on the lifespan of the launcher of itself?

		Hello,
		
		There are lots of different "kill" tools out there. Most
of them can be set to different "brutality" levels. First they try to
stop the running task by sending a kind of "Alt-F4" command. When the
task is still running properly it will react by closing all open files
and terminate the regular way. After this, when no reaction, the running
.exe can be really "killed" and can be kicked out of memory.
		
		I'm running a scheduled task that is testing the Xitami
server every minute by a simple http-Get, and if there is no answer
probably Xitami was shot by unknown reason (maybe my own PHP scripts do
so by fault). This happens 2-3 times a day to me. After a defect is
recognized, Xitami becomes killed and restarted in the way I mentioned.
I never found problems when doing so. No problems with open files, even
when PHP scrips are called.

So, are you saying the CGI simply invokes the Perl compiler after passing 
the parameters to the script?  Then once the Perl is invoked it will 
continue as a seperate process even if part of that process is to 
kill/restart the Xitami server?

Why are you still even trying to run the Xitami FTP server.  It is a well 
documented buggy server application that the Xitami folks stopped 
development on years ago.  If you start Xitami, absent of the FTP server, 
you shouldn't have any problems with Xitami hosing up on you all the time.

Hi everyone,

hopefully this hasn't been posted before (I did a search of the
archives back three years and couldn't find anything).  

I'm running Xitami on an intranet and have bee for the past seven years
with little or no problems.  I just recently upgraded to version 2.5c2
and I'm running on Windows 2000.  I've been trying to get a simple
feedback (php) form to run.  I have very little experience with php but
the form works on another server I sometimes use.  However when I access
it on the Xitami server it downloads the file instead of opening and
running  it.  Do I need a php software install in order to have a php
form work?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks

Brian

yes you need to install PHP. PHP understand's Xitami so typically all
you need to do is download the latest PHP version and runs tha
standard install script

after running the installer you need to enable php in xitami itself.
Open up your default.cfg and create 2 new sections like or copy / paste.
The path for the php directory has to be set to yours. :)
Stop the server / start the server so the changes will take effect.
If it's not working, you maybe have to put backslashes into the php path.Mine is only working this 
way. ( xitami 2.5c2)

[Filter]
    .php = "D:/PHP/php.exe"

[Mime]
    Php = "application/x-httpd-php"

I am not using Perl at all. I write all my CGI's in pure VB 5 or 6 code.
The CGI I made I called RefreshServer.exe and all you need to do is call it 
and on run, it shuts down the machine and reboots it.
I of course added the Xitami to the startup sequence or as a service auto 
start then it works fine.

I have not really had any troubles with the FTP server part except for the 
fact that if the client accessing it is having some kind of FTP app not 
dedicatedly made for the proper environment, then errors happen.

WS_FTP free version works fine on Win 95, 98, NT4  and 2000 but not XP or 
2003 because WS_FTP was made for an older winsock.
The new one shouldn't have a problem but I have not tried it.

Cute FTP clients in free mode have a problem on XP too.

Linux FTP works just fine, I tried it from my linux can and its working as 
fast as ever.

Windows FTP doesnt work at all.

Of course it's killed.
It kills the server even in this case but you could just as well create an 
application that will initiate a set order of actions by an ini file or 
registry entries after rebooting again to do what you want it to do...

Say for instance according to the following scheme...


1) save params desired to a ini file
2) Execute the reboot by force, make sure your app is in the startup list 
for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
3) On run , read the saved params in the ini file and do what you want it 
to do...
4) Restart the Xitami by using WindowsProc or ShellExec API for instance...

It's all fairly basic stuff once you get used to it.
I am sure you can do it the open source way too and even use VBScript or 
JScript on your server can to do it.

I just find Perl to "un-readable" to deal with myself and I prefer to stick 
with the VB way of controlling my machines
It's also fairly simple to re-write and alter shoul dyou want to add or 
change something later on.

Then again, to all their favourite flavor I guess (^^)

Message-ID: <DATAPIPE-AHLQ5Kcf3e000011ae@epmail2.com>

Xitami is the first web server I have ever tried to run.  I have just gotten a domain name through DNSexit, and want to run a small family web site.  I am using my home computer via an ADSL line.  I have set up Xitami, and installed 3Dwatch to update my IP.  Everything works fine on yje localhost, or if I access my domain from my computer (www.hopkinsfamily.com), but no one can access it from another computer.  I also can not access it via my computer at work.  I believe I have opened the proper ports in my firewall.  Can anyone suggest a way to test my setup?

Thanks,
Dwayne

It's possible that your ISP has a NAT installed, meaning that you
can't host things like web servers on a PC in your home.  It's not
uncommon.

I'd look for a cheap hosting plan.  There are plenty available that
will host your website.

The only ports you should need to open are 80 and if you use the FTP 21.
It could also be that your public IP is different from that provided to you 
by your provider.

Say for instance you are issued a dynamic IP 19.19.19.1 and you have this 
assigned to your router/firewall.
In fact your ISP may assign you a this only for their internal use, and run 
you through a gateway of say 19.19.18.254
So instead you show up as surfing from this gateway IP.

Go to DNSSTUFF.COM and verify your public IP address is in fact the one 
your DynIP is getting.
It will show up in the top right hand corner of the screen what you are 
actually on.
This would be the first thing I'd check and believe it or not, but it does 
even happen on ranges which are issued static IP's too on SDSL.

You should have port 80 forwared through your router, if you have one.
And it should be open in a software firewall too.  Also, your ISP may be
blocking port 80 from coming to you so you don't run a webserver. You
could check with your ISP if its allowed in your service agreemet.  If
its not allowed, don't ask. If port 80 is blocked by your ISP you could
change try changing it to a different port like 8080. Your uses would
then access it by using www.hopkinsfamily.com:8080

When I ping www.hopkinsfamily.net it shows that its ip address is
169.254.17.151.  Is that the address your server has? You can go to
www.whatismyip.com to see your server address.  That should match the web
server address that is setup for the domain in your registration.   

When I pinged it, I get no response.

By the way, www.hopkinsfamily.com shows to be an address of 169.254.17.151.
Something completely different.

One of the responses mentioned a port tester that you can run, so see what
ports are open. I don't recall what it was. (Sorry, having a clean inbox is
a New Year's resolution)

ipconfig is a tool to show your ip# of your computer build in network card.
That has nothing to do with your public ip.
A bit more detailed info about your setup would help to make more clear answers.
1. are you using a router ?
2. is your machine directly connected to the ADSL ( Iam assuming you have this kind of connection) 

The more detail we get, the easier it is to find the problem.

Lets get on some basic terms as a foundation to build the solution upon.

1.  Private IP address (only works internally/LAN) vs. Public IP address
(searchable/findable across the internet/WAN) 
2.  Dynamically assigned IP addressing (changes from time to time) vs.
Static IP addressing (the same day in day out) (see your ISP's offering
details if you don't already know.
3.  The 169.254.x.x is one of the reserved IP addressing ranges for
internal/private only usage.  It is a Class C address with the subnet mask
255.255.255.0
4.  If you are clueless about terminology do some research beyond this list
including googling and surfing Wikipedia
5.  IP addressing as a subject is a two edged subject in that it is
fundamentally simple but the details of subnetting are one of the most
dreaded subjects by teachers when instructing on networking.  Fortunately
for your sake subnetting most likely will not come into play for a single
home network.
6.  Once you understand the basics of IP addressing for your situation then
you must move on to understand putting that IP address into a publicly
reachable index that points to your machine.  This index is called a DNS
server.  DNS servers can be specifically internal so not any DNS server will
work.  You need to have a properly configured DNS server with all the right
records, forwarders, and web listeners for things to work.  Usually the
simple need is met not by doing this on your own but by having a third party
provide DNS provisioning for you.  DYNDNS.org and TZO.com are a couple of
many such business that can do this.  Your own ISP may do this and it may or
may not be for additional costs (check before you have this service
initiated).
7.  If this is getting too difficult for you, contact a local network savvy
person for hire to get this set up for you.  I bet for $50 someone would be
willing to do this.

I am glad to provide this help to someone willing to be ambitious and take
on a nice technical challenge such as yours.

Good luck,

ipconfig is a tool to show your ip# of your computer build in network card.
That has nothing to do with your public ip.
A bit more detailed info about your setup would help to make more clear
answers.
1. are you using a router ?
2. is your machine directly connected to the ADSL ( Iam assuming you have
this kind of connection) 

The more detail we get, the easier it is to find the problem.

Dale,
	I've never shied away from a little technical challenge.  Any
suggested reading?  I am already very familiar with computer hardware, and
some simple programming (BASIC, VBS, Pascal, assembly, ATLAS). I don't know
if the latter will help 8^).  I also know my way around the registry fairly
well.  I am using XP Home, so IIS is not an option.  I know there is a
"process" that will enable NT 2000 IIS to run on XP Home, but am more
interested in a supported methodology.  Xitami seems to have a fairly good
support network for shareware, and seems less complex than Apache.

Again go read up on the terms so this makes sense and you don't spin your
wheels.  The term "modem" (as in DSL Modem or similarly Cable Modem) is most
likely a router; in fact you might also refer to it as a "bridge" (in a
looser sense but that is off topic).  The modem establishes the connection
to your ISP and then converts it to route into your home environment.  This
device usually will NAT the external IP into an internal IP (like
169.254.xxx.xxx) and it may be programmed to allow you something like four
machines to simultaneously go through it to the internet.  This means it can
assign up to four addresses internally.  The router in this example is a
mini DHCP server or sorts.  If so then it is routing four internal IP
addresses through a single NAT'ed external IP address (it could also be
using port address translation too, PAT).  The point is don't get all in a
bunch over semantics; do your own homework and then ask some knowledgeable
questions.

Good luck,
Dale Unroe

This is a problem.
You cannot specify to the ADSL modem how it should react or what IP it has 
or receives from your IP.
If you have specified to receive a static IP from your ISP then use the IP 
you where assigned.

If not, then I am afraid you are on a static IP and that is only displayed 
to your "router" part of the ADSL modem and not your PC.

What you would have to do is treat it as a dynamic IP in this case and try 
to hook up with some form of free DynIP service to get the site to show up 
properly.

Sorry I shouldn't type this stuff after having been up for three days.
What I meant is, you have to treat this as if you're on a dynamic IP (not 
static) and as such you cannot set anything except rely on a DynIP service.

Do a google search for DynIP and read up on that option.

Dale,
>...and you don't spin your wheels.
Natural state of affairs for me!  I learn by doing, and enjoy the research
and discovery.

	I did discover that the ADSL "modem" is a router and has NAT
capability.  I'm starting to learn this stuff, I think.  I am using an IP
updater, 3DWatch.  It seems to work well so I'll be registering it soon,
unless I find a better one.  I set up a static IP in XP HE and forwarded
ports 80 and 21 in the NAT to this IP.  I had already opened ports 80 and 21
in my firewall, and Xitami seems to work perfectly now. Once I learned what
I needed to learn I found a site, www.portforward.com, that was able to
supply some of the details.  Thank you, and thanks to Johannes, Brian, and
the others as well.  You all got me headed in the right direction.  I know I
am by no means an expert, so more reading is still needed.  I just purchased
a 400+ page book on networking, this may help.

      I also have a few other items I want to work out; currently I am
attempting to set up PERL, get RealVNC working, and set up FTP in the near
future.  I'll keep the site updated on my progress, or lack thereof. 8^)
RealVNC is something I am just checking out, it may have uses for some of us
who deploy for long periods.

	I just downloaded and installed PXPerl (is it an acronym, PERL, or
is Perl correct?), and am going to attempt to set up a guest book using CGI.
Not very high aspirations, to be sure, but a start.

Thanks again for all the help,
Dwayne

Again go read up on the terms so this makes sense and you don't spin your
wheels.  The term "modem" (as in DSL Modem or similarly Cable Modem) is most
likely a router; in fact you might also refer to it as a "bridge" (in a
looser sense but that is off topic).  The modem establishes the connection
to your ISP and then converts it to route into your home environment.  This
device usually will NAT the external IP into an internal IP (like
169.254.xxx.xxx) and it may be programmed to allow you something like four
machines to simultaneously go through it to the internet.  This means it can
assign up to four addresses internally.  The router in this example is a
mini DHCP server or sorts.  If so then it is routing four internal IP
addresses through a single NAT'ed external IP address (it could also be
using port address translation too, PAT).  The point is don't get all in a
bunch over semantics; do your own homework and then ask some knowledgeable
questions.

Good luck,
Dale Unroe

Johannes,
	I am not using a router, it is directly connected to the ADSL.  The
modem is a ZyXel 645 Series.  It looks like I have to do some more research
on this whole topic if IP addresses.

ipconfig is a tool to show your ip# of your computer build in network card.
That has nothing to do with your public ip. A bit more detailed info about
your setup would help to make more clear answers. 1. are you using a router
? 2. is your machine directly connected to the ADSL ( Iam assuming you have
this kind of connection) 

The more detail we get, the easier it is to find the problem.

As for Perl just download the usual Win package and run the installer.

As for RealVNC, dowload and install the full package only on the server and 
use the viewer only on your work station to maintain some kind of security.
Open port 5800 and 5900 for your router to allow RealVNC access anywhere.

Also note, if you try to manage the Xitami from RealVNC, you will probably 
need to add a short cut to the folder for Xitami and one for your web 
directory paths if you use the virtual hosts in a separate folder. You will 
also have to right click the folders and other shortcuts and select OPEN 
rather than double click it when you use the viewer, however it seems to 
work ok in the web viewer version.

To log into and admin your Xitami you can then disable your web admin to 
protect xitami better, and also edit the defaults.cfg file manually.

A very helpful hint to use in all this is to add shortcuts to notepad in 
the strategical places like the xitami root foler and your cfg files path.
Then you can drag and drop files there to edit rather than assign generic 
extension tags to allow windows to control each file extension.

Further, to open the web viewer of RealVNC in this, navigate to your IP 
address ###.###.###.###:5800 to log in and you're set.

My Ignorance about Xitami just birthed a wild thought.  Do I have to have C
runtime libraries installed to use the Cgi:stdio=0 feature?

I?m running Windows/XP Home Edition, I had a similar/same problem when I

Question:


Do I have to customize (re-install) XITAMI on my system before I can use
this feature.


The reason that I suspect I may have to customize XITAMI:


1.    The path c:\imatix\... given in the error message doesn't exist on my
system:

o        c:\imatix\work\products\xitami-25\sfl\


2.    I scanned the XITAMI source code and found c:\imatix in all the
boomake.bat files.

Example:
:- Set environment variables to point to install location
:- Start by using final IBASE, then handle local -install path
set self=%0
set OLDPATH=%PATH%
set OLDPERLLIB=%PERLLIB%
set _IBASE=%IBASE%
if "%_IBASE%"=="" set _IBASE=c:\imatix
set INCDIR=%_IBASE%\xitami-25\include
set LIBDIR=%_IBASE%\xitami-25\lib
set PATH=.;%_IBASE%\xitami-25\bin;%PATH%
set PERLLIB=.;%_IBASE%\xitami-25\bin;%PERLLIB%
set _LOCAL=0

3.    It appears that I may need to update parts of XITAMI to use the actual
path names on my system



If this assumption is correct, where can I find instructions that would walk
me through the process?

No, you can use the executables provided for Windows.

I doubt this is the same issue but I will lend my comments none the less.  A
few months back I ran into a problem with CGI STDIN that wouldn't allow me
to retrieve uploaded files one buffer at a time - Xitami held the whole
uploaded file in memory before releasing it to the hard drive.  I was
writing a Progress Meter script to show users the progress of their uploaded
files so they wouldn't think anything hung or timed out.  In order to do
this you need to write the input buffer to a file, then every two seconds
(or how ever often you wanted) read the size of that file , a second script
would run using an html refresh and check the progress/size of that file and
increment the progress bar.

Xitami held the entire STDIN buffer before writing to the file...so with a
1000K file to be uploaded, the local file size literally went from 0 to
1000K (when done) even though the buffer was reading 1K at a time.  The
progress meter would start and show the file size as 0....and stay at 0,
then 20 seconds later it suddenly flashed 1000K and showed the file upload
as finished.    I was always able to retrieve the total file size from the
CGI $ENV{CONTENT_LENGTH}, but the buffer simply wouldn't write to the local
file until the entire file/files had completed their upload.  I even tried
to reading the TEMP files that are natively created via the CGI and
monitored their progress during the file uploads.  The same thing occurred.

I installed Apache, ran the identical upload and progress meter scripts and
it worked perfectly....I saw the same 1000K file incrementing in batches of
75k per second via the progress meter.

So, as mentioned before, I doubt this issue is the same but the fact that
you were working with CGI STDIN and STDOUT and were having (buffer?)
problems I thought I would bring this up.  Unfortunately for me, in order to
have this simple little progress meter for my users I have to have Apache
installed and run my upload scripts on the Apache server...I am still
sticking with Xitami but at the moment thats all I am using the Apache for -
a progress meter!

limit
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent HTTP connections. On systems that
can handle lots of open sockets (e.g. Unix, OS/2, WinNT, Win98), you may
want to set this high. Xitami does not impose any fixed limit. If you set
this value to 0, it means 'no limit'.
Default: 0.

my entry in ......\app\xitami.cfg is

    limit=0

Hope that helped

Message-ID: <FAEMIFKOBMPMNNMHDPGIIEKACCAA.kiddre@ix.netcom.com>

I sent this message to Quercus REXX support.
I want to use REXX to write cgi-bin programs for my Web server.
The XITAMI Web server that I am using provides two input/output options.
1. The cgi-bin program (REXX routine) can read directly from the stdin
device (or alternately from DOSENV variables), and write directly to the
stdout device.
2. The cgi-bin program (REXX routine) can read input from a temporary file
named pipe0001.cgi (or alternately from DOSENV variables), and write output
to a temporary file named pipe0001.cgo.
For several reasons, I would prefer using the second option.

My first and most severe problem is that my XITAMI Web server aborts after
issuing an Assertion Failure message whenever I try to use the pipe0001.cgi
and pipe0002.cgo temporary files in my REXX program. I've run traces that
have shown that the REXX program has run to completion after reading from
pipe0001.cgi and creating pipe0001.cgo.

I've asked for help from XITAMI and the XITAMI user's forum on this problem,
but so far, everyone seems to be baffled.

Up until I installed the updated REXX files that you sent to me yesterday, I
was able to successfully use the first option by running REXX.exe instead of
PREXXW.exe. After I installed the REXX updates that you sent to me
yesterday, the first option no longer works. Now the REXX.exe output is
written to the REXX console window instead of to stdout so the XITAMI Web
server can no longer send the output back across the Internet to the client
that submitted the form.

When I switch back to the older copy of REXX, once again I can read input
from ENVIRONMENT variables using DOSENV, and write output (my HTML Web page)
to stdout.

Questions:
* Do you have any suggestions that might help me make option 2 work?
* Is there anyway I can force PREXXW.exe to read from the stdin stream and
write to the stdout stream instead of to the REXX console window?
* What changes were made to REXX.exe in the update that causes it to write
to the REXX console window instead of to stdout?
I will really appreciate any light you can shed on this problem.

Thank you!

I know it isn't probably the answer you are looking for, but I've been 
using Regina REXX for over 5 years to do CGI and its not failed me.

http://regina-rexx.sourceforge.net/

Its open source, so if it's broke, you have all the parts. :-)

If you are running XITAMI on Windows/98 or Windows/XP with Cgi:stdio=0, may
I have a copy of your XITAMI.cfg and your defaults.cfg files?  I am having
the same problem with the Assertion failed error using two different REXX

ok now here is a stupid question but that's a) nothing unusual for me and 
b) very easy to reply to I bet (^^)

I misplaced a few good files from my old setup so I would very much 
appreciate if someone could pop in a message here as how to;

a) Add all necessary lines in the defaults.cfg to enable PHP and,

b) what exactly to add for the mime types to enable VBS again.

It seems my machine doesn't like what I did to it.

Thanks in advance.

Easiest way is to detail it here. Imatix people read this list as do
most users so we can learn to avoid it.

Unless it is a bug with a vrey simple fix and/or it is a major
security hole I doubt Imatix will fix it...

I really wish they would pick up the development of this great little http 
server again.
Up until the bug with FTP I find this server the best of all alternatives, 
including IIS and Apache out there.

I guess I'm getting to old to do major strategic choices anymore but I 
would prefer to run Xitami than anything else.

If it wasn't for the ASP options only being free in IIS I would find no use 
for it at all.

I will second that emotion.  I have use Xitami for several years, and it 
is the ideal for home users (in particular) such as myself. Simple and 
effective.
I wonder if there are enough 'technical' types in the user community to 
think about supporting it as 'open source', if Imatix would release the 
code ?

:-)  The code has been released since the very first version in 1996.

Could you pass me a link to a MSVC 5 or similar port version of it?
Thanks.

Problem:

I am convinced that this must be a bug in XITAMI. I've eliminated everything
else with the possible exception of ipUpdater somehow being involved.
The problem is very easy to recreate. It will occur every time stdio=0 is
specified in the configuration file.
I've recreated the failure linking to routines in cgi-bin that I have coded
using two different REXX products and a .bat file. The failure occurs after
the cgi-bin routine terminates.
These files will recreate the problem.
