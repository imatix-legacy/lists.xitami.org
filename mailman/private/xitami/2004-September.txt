hi,

I'm a Xitami user, posted this problem before, large file on slow connection doesn't work on
new Xitami, I had to switch back to old version 2.4d9, nobody could tell me how to fix it until
now, good job! 
hopefully Imatix will use this fix in new version.

I don't know a solution but I can verify that this happened to me as
well when I upgraded to the newest version about a month ago ... I too
had to roll back to 2.4d10 ...

Also noticed that it wasn't reading the configuration file properly
either as it won't disable lrwp on port 81.

I have run into this problem before when I don't make an extra entry for 
virtual hosts. Basically when I add a new virtual host 
www.somedomain.com  =  somedomain.cfg I then go into the default virtual 
hosts table and add "somedomain.com = somedomain.cfg"

that way you end up with :

"somedomain.com = somedomain.cfg" and
"www.somedomain.com = somedomain.cfg"

That is a necessary step, of course.  However, what this customer of
Jill's also needs to do is ensure that the DNS entries for the two
domains both point to the single machine.  Remember, there are people out
there too stupid to understand that www.somewhere.com is NOT the same
thing as somewhere.com --- unless the DNS makes it so.

I have been using it and I think it has solved some of my timeout problems, although the site still has a tendency to go down over long weekends.

I have everything setup pretty good, but find that I am unable

Is there something additional I have to do?

looking at the source code I think Xitami can rename only files, not dirs
(it uses rename from stdio.h).

Try to create the new directory then rename all the files using full paths
to cause xitami to move files:

ren dir1 -> dir2:

make dir2
ren dir1/file1.txt  -> dir2/file1.txt
this should move file1.txt from the folder dir1 to the folder dir2

Hello, 

I've just installed phpBB message board software on a few of my virtual 
hosts, but I realize their administration panel is located under /admin , 
therefore (even if virtual host web based admin is disabled) I cannot get to 
the admin panel unless I rename it and modify a number of php scripts. 


I'm wondering if there is a way to change Xitami's panel to reside under 
something other than /admin ? 

Can I just rename the directory and some config files or what would be 
involved ? 


Thanks,
Josh

I think the url is set in xitami.cfg, near the end of the file in the =
[Wsx] section.
You should try to create this section in default.cfg (is better leaving =
xitami.cfg as it is) adding:

[Wsx]
    <new_url_here>=3Dxiadmin

this should work.

ps. where can i find phpBB?

Greetings.

When I saw the option, "Start when TCP/IP is ready?", I thought that 
meant the same as "Run as system service". Then I saw the SVRANY part of 
the FAQ that outlines how to run Xitami as a service.  So, what does 
"Start when TCP/IP is ready?" really mean?

Kind regards,

Subject: [Xitami] Strange logging issue - source address = server's name
Message-ID: <WorldClient-F200409221352.AA52270012@coaxial.ca>

I recently migrated one of my mail/web servers to an off-site location,
and I'm noticing a problem with demographics, which leads back to the HTTP
Acess logs. 

In all my web logs for my webservers, the source, or first field in CLFX
logging, is the server's name (server29).

I have serveral different versions of Xitami for different purposes on
different IPs on the server, and use CLFX logging. 
causing this.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have included some sample logs
below to provide some clues.

Thanks,
Josh

---------

All Xitami logs refelect the source as the servername (it's a windows 2003
server named "server29") :

SERVER29 - - [19/Sep/2004:17:55:09 -0700] "GET /test2.swf HTTP/1.1" 304
703236 "" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;)"
SERVER29 - - [19/Sep/2004:19:30:02 -0700] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -1 ""
"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;)"

before the move to a new server they were displaying correctly :

208.38.4.99 - - [29/Jul/2004:16:02:20 -0700] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 1015 ""
"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)"

I never used it and I don't really know, but I think it should be that
xitami open the 80 port when it detect tcp/ip started...

for the service version you should start xisrv32 /i instead of xitami.exe or
xigui32.exe

No, that message means that port 80 is opened by some other program, if you
have a good firewall you can see what application is using that port. you
can use zonealarm, kerio or the one you like best (and you MUST use one if
you connect to internet in these days). maybe, if you tried to launch many
times xitami, it should be that one is still open and running, and the
others you are trying to start find port 80 used; try "visiting" yourself
with a browser: type http://127.0.0.1 and you see what happens.

It should be the reverse dns (RDNS). Check under Admin/Logging/accesLog if
"translate IP addresses" is active. If not add in the configuration file
(defaults.cfg) the section [Accesslog] and the key translate=1 ; if you want
even on the error log add the same key in the sect [Errorlog].

Subject: [Xitami] webmask / iplist.txt
Message-ID: <4151D6E5.25612.2899F95@localhost>

Hello Members,

I'm running xitami 2.5c2 and could need some help regards the entry "webmask" in the security 
section of the xitami / default.cfg
I checked the help file and the concept overall I'm able to understand. The handling of adding
ip addresses should be simple and easy so I like to create an iplist.txt file.
As from the help file it should look like this:

webmask= "!210.155.30.*,*    # access for 210.155.30.* not allowed and all the rest has access

My question now: How to start the second line ?  Just with the ip or like my sample below ?

webmask= "!210.155.30.*    # access not allowed
webmask= "*"                     # all other addresses allowed 

This would be more convenient for me, each line a separate ip which would be excluded.
Has someone any experience with the "webmask" and would give me some help ?

Thank's in advance.

I think you should use a single line webmask, but i suggest you to configure
a packet filter rule in your firewall where you admit inbound connections to
port 80 only to the ip you like.

Hello Dario,

As the help file noted, one can create a simple txt file in which one can put addresses in each 
line. It is even possible to have blank lines.
Handling of addind IP's should be as simple/convenient as possible and I like the idea of the
txt-file. The question is: Do I have to start EACH line with    webmask= ip#  or just the first 
line and the second line will have ONLY the ip# ?
I will check this out over the next few days.

Thank's
Johannes

As I understand reading the help you have to put all in one line: from the
help:

"... Use spaces and/or commas to separate patterns..."

so it could be like that:

webmask=192.168.0.*, 10.10.*,127.0.0.1

where you admit ONLY this ip ranges. try this if it works.

I am hosting a server on my computer for the first time and am having some
trouble. When I enter my ip address  of 24.129.86.161 I am able to access
my web site. When I enter gracebase.org, I am not able to enter my web
page. I have forwarded gracebase.org to my ip address. 

Any thoughts or suggestions?

gracebase.org is an address (66.113.136.229) on a Hostway computer.
You have nothing on that web space. What you need to do is either have Hostway
redirect visitors to your pages at 24.129.86.161 or put a page on the Hostway
site that will redirect/link people to your site.

A site for people with "special needs" should be easy to navigate. I would
suggest dropping the frames. When writing web pages use KISS.

Alex,

I am hosting a server on my computer for the first time and am having some
trouble. I do not want to use frames but I cannot figure out how to get
includes to work. I am learning HTML but am far from proficient. I have
Perl in my CGI-bin. Does anyone know where I could find a page in HTML
view that works with Xitami and uses SSI’s? If I am able to get my hands
on one page that works with Xitami and uses includes, I could build the
rest of my site.

Any thoughts?

Thank you for your thoughts. I used frames because I could not get SSI's
to work. If I can figure them out, I will revert to them because I do like
includes more than frames.

If you have perl installed & working SSI's should work. 
Does the SSI test page work on the xitami default.htm? 
Look in webpages\xitami\index4.htm for help with SSI.

It takes some time for a dns modification to propagate accross the internet 
(worst case 48 hours).

Gracebase.org points to 66.113.136.229, not to the ip you mention.

Check your dns records at 
http://www.dnsreport.com/tools/dnsreport.ch?domain=gracebase.org

Forgive me if I misunderstand, Timothy, but do you have Perl 
installed on your machine?  Unless it is, having a perl script in 
your cgi-bin will make no difference, it will not do anything.

If you're running linux/unix Perl is part of the system but if 
your OS is Windows it is not.

If you don't have Perl you can download it from:

http://www.perl.org/

I run Xitami on several Windows machines and with Perl installed 
SSI and Perl scripts worked straight out of the box ... I think I 
had to enable SSI in the setup pages of Xitami but it's so long 
ago that I may misremember that.

Best of luck with it,

Stuart
