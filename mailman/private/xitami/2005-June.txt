Hi=20

I have a win2000 sp4 box where, when I try to start xitami I get the =
following

of course port 7081 and 7080 are not tied to any service.
No firewall software is running on that box.

what does it mean the error "smthttp: Protocol not known"?

I'm using the default xitami.cfg and a small defaults.cfg to shift the=20
port (portbase=3D7000) and to disable ftp


any ideas?

thank you very much

stefano

Most likely you don't have TCP/IP networking correctly or fully installed.

The server is running a mailserver (smtp/pop/imap) and vnc server with no
problem.
Is there any check I can do on it?

thanks

Hmm.  From a quick look at the source code, the error is being detected on a 
call to "getprotobyname".  This is usually an innocent routine.  Strangely, 
win32 is then reporting "no error".  

This URL explains the possible errors:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winsock/
winsock/getprotobyname_2.asp

If other services are running, then TCP/IP is presumably correctly installed.  
So this looks like a problem with Windows that it's not even detecting 
correctly itself.  My advice would be to (a) reboot :-), (b) try on a 
different machine, and (c) consider upgrading Windows.

This is unlikely to help.

I'd suggest that there is something wrong with the Windows installation... try 
doing ping, ftp, or telnet in a dos prompt.  These commands also use normal 
TCP/IP and should fail in the same way.

ping and telnet work on the dos  prompt.

:-(  Possibly the Xitami executable has gotten corrupted.  I don't think I've 
ever seen this particular problem before.

Maybe he should check the files in:
\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc

Maybe the "protocol" file is messed up?

This is something I understand, and perhaps the reason why I'm still running Xitami 'out of the box' after nearly four years. This however, along with trial & error, are my only sources of Xitami knowledge, so I wait patiently, and hope that someone else comes along asking questions about things I'd like to learn......then hope to hell that someone replies in a straight forward language that I'm able to understand. Some users tend to become very irritated with others who aren't quite up on all the terminology, others seem to become irritated when topics have been discussed more than once, which IMO, sort of defeats the purpose of discussion.....especially if the previously discussed material did not prove to be useful.
 
I'm still REALLY stuck on a few things that have been discussed here more than once in the past, but I'm not about to ask questions......especially after seeing the frustration cause by some the people whom I've witnessed asking already.
 
If you find an answer to your original question Rick, feel free to contact me off-list. It's something I'd really like to know about myself :-D
 
Cheers!

Hello !

The only way you could force the browser not trying to display the file is 
to change the MIME type of the file.

Change the association from "video/mpeg" to "application/octet-stream"
The visitor will be prompted to "run from current location" or "save".

Since the extension is still mpg, when the user opens the file, it plays 
from the local storage.

I'm not sure if it will work, but it's the only possibility.

That is just what download sites like tucows.com & download.com do.
What you need is some java script code for auto download on the page. 
Then clicking on the file in a list brings up a page with the java code. 
Do a search for free java scripts.

Alex,

What about simply renaming the file? Instead "this.mpg" name "this.xxx" 
so the browser asks for download and the user simply can rename.

Hello Stefano,

You could try the following:

- Configure Xitami (for testing) to portbase 0 / port 80.
- Try another simple webserver for testing, e.g. minihttp if this can 
open port 7080.

Apologies folks.  Looks like I approved one too many of the messages
when letting in some "not subscribed" posts this afternoon.

What a strange browser your visitors must be using; an FTP server has no
capability of sending a Content-Type header, so it's purely a binary (or
text) stream to the client end.

A browser has absolutely no right to invent its own concept of a
Content-Type, *especially* when acting as an FTP client.

thank you kindly for your input martin! this is certainly an option i will=

thank you for your interesting suggestion marc! by this, i assume that you=

something i plan to look into more deeply in the near future. if it works,=

interesting that you mention java-script alex, as it's originally where i=

 i'm able to google-up numerous support forums though, only to read posts=

from so many others, who are trying to achieve similar results. most of=20

 on a side note to all of this, i often use a rather nifty little service=

for sending extremely large e-mail attachments (up to 1gb. in size):
 http://s5.yousendit.com/
 - when downloading files through this service, they never attempt to load=

exactly what i'm talking about, please click this direct file-link to a=20

rather than your file-player:
 http://d50.yousendit.com/C/0LJ97YT1TG4M0QY8UE1AT47UL/Use_seat.wmv
 because "this particular example" completely eliminates the use of=20

 thank you jeff! i assumed this might work as well... 'my' tests however,=

have concluded that left-clicking a direct ftp-link to a media-file 'still'=

makes a call to the file-player (on all 3 of my work-stations). to run thes=
e=20
tests, i've been accessing media-files (via ftp link) which are located on =

 are you suggesting brian, that an ftp link should 'not' call up the=20

I am running W2K Server (NTFS) and I have done some research concerning =
directory limitations within the W2K environment and now I am looking =
for potential limitations with Xitami.  My server will host potentially =
10s of thousands  of users.  Each user will have the ability to create =
their own photo albums and then have photo books within each album.  =
>From a storage standpoint each user will have their own user directory, =
that user directory will hold from 1 to 15 sub directories that will =
represent the photo albums.  Then each photo album directory will have =
from 1 to 15 photo book albums.  Sorry for the extensive path below put =
I wanted to give an accurate representation of what I am looking to do.  =
The directory tree will look like this (each numbered directory, ie: =
1000, 2000 - will hold up to 1000 user directories each).  The things I =
am considering are sub-directory limitations per parent directory and =
performance issues for Windows considering the directory structure and =
then ultimately Xitami's performance handling the directory structure.  =
Comments?!

This is the only info I found pertaining to NTFS limitations: =

If you haven't seen this before, you haven't been operating a server 
for long ;-) It's automated ("script kiddie") scanning for 
vulnerabilities (mostly old IIS flaws, probably). Just ignore it.

No, you don't have to edit each file.
The http server adds these headers automatically, using a table located in 
your configuration file (xitami.cfg)

Example of your xitami.cfg file:
[Mime]
     default=*/*                         #   Default MIME type

     #  Text MIME types
     etx=text/x-setext
     htm=text/html
     htp=text/html
     html=text/html
     rtx=text/richtext
     tsv=text/tab-separated-values
     txt=text/plain
     .=text/plain                        #   Files with no extension

     #  Image MIME types
     gif=image/gif
(and so on)


Of course, you could add individual headers to each file (that can be done 
for cgi applications, so you can send the file in "chunked" mode, or gzip 
the file or whatever that request non-standard headers) but it's easier 
with one single configuration file.
Don't modify the xitami.cfg file, but create (or modify) default.cfg

The challenge here is that after making these changes, no video/mpeg will  
stream in the visitor's browser.  Of course, this may be exactly what  
you're looking for, but it's something to be aware of.

Also, as you mentioned in your first post, I believe, there are several  
ways to do this in php.  PHP is a free application, installs very easily,  
and adds quite a bit of power to your web pages, imo.  I use it very  
extensively on my sites, and it really adds some great content.  It's  
something you might want to look in to.  :-)

I hadn't actually considered whether or not a browser has rights.   
Nevertheless, I'm running xitami as a web and file server, and an http  
link and ftp link to the same image produce exactly the same results on  
the two browsers I use.  I dare say that these two browsers constitute a  
majority of visitors to my sites.

Hi Rick,  this just came to me when I went to bed, and I thought I'd get  
up and test it and type it out real quick:

Changing the MIME filetype in the xitami configuration file (preferably  
defaults.cfs) is probably your best bet.  However, this will hose the  
ability of the server to provide streaming type media or images when you  
do want them.

A workaround for this would be to install two copies of xitami on the same  
computer in different directories.  In the second installation, make the  
changes to the MIME types that Marc suggested, and change the portbase  
 from 0 to, say, 1000.  That will cause the second server to listen on port  
1080 for web traffic.  Then, on your home page, create links to the media  
files that include the reference to port 1080, such as  
http://www.mydomain.com:1080/mymedia.wmv.  This will cause the visitor to  
hit your computer on port 1080, and the second xitami server will  
respond.  Since the second server is programmed to confuse browsers as to  
the type of file, they'll get the download prompt.

In this way, you can have your server handle file types normally, but  
point visitors to the second server when you want to force the download  
prompt.  You'll have to do the obvious shuffling of your media files to a  
place that the second server can see, but I just tested this, and it works  
fine on my system.

Now...what are you doing to do when the visitor clicks "Open" instead of  
"Save?"  :-D

Michael

Hello !

There are no limitations on the number of files a directory can hold.
Windows is very fast at accessing files.
I've done some testing with directories containing 20.000 files, any file 
can always be retrieved in less than 500 ms (PIII 600MHz with windows 2000 
server)

The problem will not be the amount of files but the expected traffic 
(photos are typically very large).

It's important that the drive is defragmented every week or so.
Begin with a clean, formatted disk (best NOT to use the windows system disk).
Check that the MFT (master file table) is not fragmented (this can only be 
archieved by using a newly formatted disk or partition). The MFT contains 
all the links to the files, and it's important that this file does not 
become fragmented, as a defragmenter is not able to defragment it.
Use a second disk and not a partition, this will ensure fast access.
And use at least 512 MB of ram (windows will use part of it to store the 
file list).

If you have more than 10.000 effective users (with some 100 users online at 
any moment), you should consider professional solutions like load 
balancing, cluster systems, fail over, ....

Xitami on itself is as good as the underlying OS. Don't use the included 
FTP server with high volume transfers as it is not very stable under heavy 
load (it's fine for small files). Xitami itself is very stable, typically 
running for months and not needing any reboot. For such a demanding 
application, don't install anything else on the server, and stop most 
windows services.

Don't use the indexing service, switch the 8.3 naming off, don't use 
compression, ...
Dynamic disks are not better than basic disks when it comes to speed (You 
only should use dynamic disks if you plan to use partitions spanning 
multiples disk, that's the only reason for using dd)
A raid 01 is a good thing too for your data disk.

XP does a lot more than just displaying the files.
For instance, it creates an alternate stream for each image file, 
containing a thumbnail of the image. FAT-32 files don't have streams, so 
there is less processing involved.
FAT-32 is a leaner file system, but it's less robust, and slower for 
directories with lots of files. NTFS suffer less performance degradation 
when files are getting fragmented.

Besides, don't use windows explorer to time directory access.
To display my 20000 files, it takes nearly 5 seconds. Probably the files 
are read and sorted before being displayed. Take also into account that for 
each file an icon must be displayed.

No, when switching the 8.3 naming convention OFF, you switch compatibility 
with legacy applications off. The 8.3 sheme has a 8 character limit, the 
LFN not.
By switching 8.3 support off, you switch off the possibility to display 
file names using the 8.3 naming convention for applications needing it.
Not having to bother to create unique 8.3 filenames based on the LFN can 
speed up the system. Whenever a file is created, a 8.3 filename must be 
created too, and in most cases this mean that the directory must be 
searched to look for an unique name, and create a new one if the name is 
already in use. With large directories, this process must be repeated over 
and over.

 From Microsoft:
"Every time you create a file with a long file name, NTFS creates a second 
file entry that has a similar 8.3 short file name. A file with an 8.3 short 
file name has a file name containing 1 to 8 characters and a file name 
extension containing 1 to 3 characters. The file name and file name 
extension are separated by a period.
If you have a large number of files (300,000 or more) in a folder, and the 
files have long file names with the same initial characters, the time 
required to create the files increases. The increase occurs because NTFS 
bases the short file name on the first six characters of the long file 
name. In folders with more than 300,000 files, the short file names start 
to conflict after NTFS uses all of the 8.3 names that are similar to the 
long file names. Repeated conflicts between a generated short file name and 
existing short file names cause NTFS to regenerate the short file name from 
6 to 8 times.
To reduce the time required to create files, you can use the fsutil 
behavior set disable8dot3 command to disable the creation of 8.3 short file 
names. (You must restart your computer for this setting to take effect.) 
For more information about disabling 8.3 short file names, see 
"MS-DOS-Readable File Names on NTFS Volumes" later in this chapter."

It surprises me not one iota that MSIE is "helpful" enough to mislead its
users through imagining that the last few characters of a file name might
have some particular significance (after all, many viruses and worms rely
upon such broken behaviour).  However, I am a little surprised that Opera
should have joined the great unwashed.

Perhaps the OP should tell his/her visitors to cut'n'paste the relevant
parts of an ftp:-schema URI into a proper FTP client, and avoid browsers
altogether :-(

I hold  alot of users/folders under Win2k3 NTFS.  NTFS uses a btree (I 
believe) so it's pretty good on bulky directories.  You can increase 
performance two ways through windows.  Use a directory tree index scheme 
to limit your folder/files per directory or (and I think the bigest 
performance gain for you) would be windows disk Cache.  Windows disk 
cache comes from "unused" memory so the more free memory you got the 
more file/directory tables will be able to be held in memory.  This lets 
the system bypass hard drive tables and access directly from RAM which 
is much faster.  My main server has 1 gig of ram and I will upgrade it 
to 2 before long.  Win2k3 also has faster file access then win2k.

To second what Gene said, NTFS can handle massive numbers of files per  
directory.  In fact, I'm not sure that there is a limit to the number of  
files per folder.  Technically, the maximum number of files on a single  
NTFS volume is over 16 billion billion, although WindowsXP imposes a limit  
of just over 4 billion.

I think your issue is going to be performance of NTFS rather than quantity  
of files.  Microsoft recommends disabling short-file name generation if  
you're going to have more than 300,000 files per folder on an NTFS  
volume.  They provide some information and instruction for this at  
http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/Windows/XP/all/reskit/en-us/prkc_fil_tdrn.asp

I would venture to say that your Xitami performance is only going to be  
limited by the performance of NTFS.

Do Microsoft really use the name "stream" for this?  It seems an
unfortunate (and misleading) ambiguity, given that "streams" already gets
used for multi-processing activity [within an application] and also for
"the contents of a file in the file system".

Surely what you describe here is akin to Mac's "resource fork"?  OS/2
(and eComStation) use EAs (extended attributes) for the same
functionality.  (NTFS still includes support for OS/2 EAs.)

If Microsoft had stuck with HPFS (to which they still own source rights)
instead of inventing the inferior NTFS for their OS/3, there wouldn't be
any question of fragmentation, since HPFS avoids it entirely.

We (programmers in a windows environment) use the word 'thread' for 
multiple processing.
http://www.powerbasic.com/support/technote/multithreading1.asp

Streams on NTFS volumes are something else than extended attributes, they 
are just an alternate file content. The main file content (the one you see 
when you open the file in a word processor) is the unnamed stream.

Hope this helps.

When Windows accesses a directory on an NTFS volume, it updates the 
LastAccess time stamp on each directory it detects. Therefore, if there 
are a large number of directories, this can affect performance.

To sum everyone's comments up:
    1.  NTFS has no limits to the amount of folders and files any given
directory can have.
                - ???  Does XP have the 4 billion issue or is that NTFS?  If
NTFS than W2K Server will have the problem too, correct?
    2.  I need to worry about performance .
    3.  I will have better performance with 8.3 formatting turned off
                - ??? how/where do I turn 8.3 off
    4.  Performance will still be an issue,
                - ??? how else can I optimize performance?  more RAM?
constant NTFS deframentation? constant HD/Volume defragmentation?
    5.  Am I to assume that Xitami will only suffer if Windows suffers?
There aren't any issues for Xitami handling this kind of directory
structure?

I will probably have a few more questions.  Thanks for all the comments
folks.

If you plan to put 4 billion files on one drive, you should first check 
it's capacity ;)

Besides, if you want to provide services to such a huge number of 
customers, you should use other systems.

Some questions that needs adressing:
How will the user registration be done?
Directing one user to it's directory?
Checking it's used disk space?
You need a very good scripting language, at least ISAPI or fastCGI

What is the purpose of the whole thing?
Some sort of file repository (unfrequent access) of picture sharing (bursty 
activity after return from vacation) ???

Suppose you have 10.000 users, with maximum 100 users online at any moment 
(the maximal load to ensure fast response).
Each user has 10 directories containing 100 files, total 1000 files/user
Each file is 250.000 bytes in size (my camera creates 2MB images)
Each user will need 250.000.000 bytes, or 250MB.
Your 10.000 users will need 2.500GB of storage.

You are in need of a very professional package with clustered servers, NAS, 
redundancy, load balancing, ...
Xitami (and to a lesser extend Windows) is not able to provide this.

It may perhaps,
 
be a greater educational experience, if we informed this gentleman that such a thing is known as a "Virtual Host" or V-Host...
 
Maybe then, he'll know exactly what part of "TFM" he should "R".
 
This is a prime example of what I described in my last post.  If he's unable to obtain such basic information HERE, where is he to turn?

PS.  My advice David, once you've read the Xitami documentation pertaining to V-Hosts, log into your WBC, and use the V-Host Wizard.  There's a lot to be learned by observing what it does.

Not very helpful, and that is what support lists are for. What seems
simple to those who have done it may not be so obvious to others. Here a
few lines from a sample defaults.cfg file. Host1.htm is the default web
page and host1 the default folder.

[Server]
    Default1 =3D "host1.htm"
    Priority =3D "1"
    Recover =3D "1"
    Webpages =3D "host1"

[Virtual-hosts]
    Www.host2.com =3D "host2.cfg"

The [Server] section of the host2.cfg will contain the info for the
second host, the default web page and folder. Put in the appropriate
listings for your situation and you should get it going without too much
trouble.

[Server]
    Default1 =3D "host2.htm"
    Priority =3D "1"
    Recover =3D "1"
    Webpages =3D "host2"

[Alias]
pippo=C:\Server\pippo

The alias work, because when I navigate
"http://localhost/pippo"
the browser list the directory, but...
For experimental, I put in a simple php file
named "index.php":

<?
phpinfo();
?>

Well, when i navigate ""http://localhost/pippo/index.php"
nothing appear, but the error message
"No input file specified"
What's the solution?
Help please!

Okay, here's a shot in the dark:

I've been able to get alias to work.  My configuration:

(Defaults.cfg)
[Alias]
photos="D:\Photos"

*D: is a mapped network drive, not the server.

(reference)
src="photos/skyline/album/index.html"

You've referenced the info.php file as a foreign file, not as a virtual
local file.  I've seen where the reference for something
"file:/something.ext" for local stuff but never can remember when to use
what.  All I recall is that using the "http" sent me nowhere.

Hope this will can helps your problem a bit.

My only problem with the Alias call is while reviewing these photo files
(lots) on two different computers (looking on one, moving on another), I
appear to have blown out the NetBios connect on the "D" computer.  Was
viewing a lot of pictures back and forth thru a browser, and moving files
directly from another unit.  Both wireless, that that shouldn't matter.

Got a "no more connections available error" on the viewing computer along
with these console errors:

2005/06/04 21:36:43: smttran: cannot open
'D:Photos\skyline\album\Discard\slides\100_0142.JPG' for 'i'
2005/06/04 21:36:43: Invalid argument

Re-booting the "D" computer fixed the connection.  So, anyone know a fix for
what appears to be a NetBios flaw (real, no editorials please).

Thanks,
Charles

Usual suspects:
Xitami Server and "D" computer are Win98SEs.  Viewer is an iMac Orange (OS X
10.2.8), and manipulator is an old Toshiba laptop with a recent Win98SE
install.  Running NetBios under TCP/IP.  Pulled NetBEUI and found I can talk
to the Orange.

Indeed; however, the original exhortation to RTFM can still apply.
Sadly, hardly anyone these days bothers to read more than a smidgeon of
any documentation before launching into activity (perhaps the correct
verb is "floundering") on the grounds that /everything/ in computing is
meant to be intuitive.  It ain't.

When I first start using a new product, I read the /entirety/ of the
manual before doing anything with it (and, yes, when I got a VAX back in
1982, I /did/ read all 22 shelf-feet of manuals).  By reading a manual
(or collection thereof), even if one does not understand all the concepts
at first, many bits of jargon are introduced, and better enable one to
understand the rest.  [Also, I'm blessed with an eidetic memory, so will
know after one reading that "the bit about virtual hosts" starts half-way
down the right-hand page about one-third of the way through the book.]

Reading manuals on the screen don't really help one to understand
(although fine for "command reference" type reminders once one is
familiar with all the principles), so print out all 400+ pages or
whatever and settle down for an evening's reading.

Of course, in this day and age we're lucky if there IS a manual with any
software product.

In your xitami directory, create a file called defaults.cfg that contains  
the following:  (If you already have a defaults.cfg, just add this text to  
it)

[Virtual-hosts]
     www.mydomain1.com = "mydomain1.cfg"
     www.mydomain2.com = "mydomain2.cfg"
     www.mydomain3.com = "mydomain3.cfg"

Add as many domains as you'd like here.


Now, create each of the cfg files for the domains.  In each cfg file, you  
should have (as a minimum):

[Server]
     webpages = "path/to/your/web/pages"

Save each of these files, and restart your server.

I just rebuilt my server and have this problem. When I run xigui32.exe
it runs fine, however when I try to start it as a service using
xiwinnt.exe it doesn't load any configuration files. I installed the
service via manual install using xiwinnt -i as per the documentation.

Hey David, you can either spend your time reading this exhortation about  
an exhortation which doesn't help you accomplish your task, or you can  
just go and configure your server for multiple hosts following the  
directions from other posts.  :-)

Good luck.

All,

To configure virtual hosts, you have to know two things.  First, what
this means and how it works technically.  For that, the Xitami manual
is pretty detailed and I'd say, yes, RTFM.  It's the authoratitive
explanation.  Second, how to set the server config files to actually
make a new vhost.  Since there are several options, the advice of
others may help.

Here is what we do for virtual hosts.

1. create a directory, "vhost", and a subdirectory for each virtual
host's home page.

2. create a .cfg file for the virtual host with the name of the
domain, defining:

[Accesslog]
    Filename =3D "mydomain.log"
[Security]
    Filename =3D "mydomain.aut"
[Server]
    Webpages =3D "vhosts/mydomain.com"
[Wsx]
    Admin =3D ""
    Setup =3D ""

3.disable all WBA access for this domain, in mydomain.aut:

[/Admin]
    admin=3D-
[/Setup]
    admin=3D-

4. create an FTP user for the domain to allow uploading of web pages,
in ftpusers.aut:

[mydomain-<something>]
    access=3DGPDMR
    password=3D<password>
    root=3D<xitami-home>/vhosts/mydomain.com

5. define the virtual host in defaults.cfg:

[Virtual-Hosts[
  mydomain.com =3D "mydomain.cfg"
  www.mydomain.com =3D "mydomain.cfg"

The virtual host wizard does most of this but does not collect virtual
hosts under a single directory, which keeps things tidy.

After defining a new virtual host, stop and restart Xitami.  Make sure
the permissions on the vhost directory are correct and upload your
pages.

It's probably starting in the wrong directory. =20

Sorry about the confusion,


Your settings:
(Defaults.cfg)
[Alias]
phpmyadmin=3D"C:\phpmyadmin"

Your previous reference (where c:\pippo was the alias):
   ...when i navigate ""http://localhost/pippo/index.php"
=20
Your statement, in your web page, should have been simply =
"pippo/index.php", a simple file reference that allows the original =
alias to substitute for "pippo".

     As an example: <a href=3D"pippo/index.php"> refers to a local file =
(in your system) without having to resolve an HTTP reference to =
wherever.  I'm not certain whether an http reference will even use the =
alias substituition so you'll be looking for index.php in the pippo =
folder of your default directory.

SO, your current alias example would be simply referenced as =
"phpmyadmin/index.php", without no HTTP.  This, I believe, is the common =
shorthand reference for a local file.  The long way would be something =
like file://phpmyadmin/index.php. =20

BTW,
> In my php.ini I configured so:
>cgi.force_redirect =3D 0
>cgi.fix_pathinfo =3D 1
>register_globals =3D On

These settings only deal with php and have nothing to do with the alias. =
 It could interfere with the viewing of the index.php page, if the =
brower sees it.  The cgi.force_redirect=3D0 setting was the only =
required I had to make for my php application work.

Hope that was a little clearer,
Charles

Now that I've gotten good at virtual hosting, to look back at the manual is
to see a lot of "oh that's what they were talking abouts."  Prior to that,
the instructions were confusing in rather subtle ways.  Each part may seem
simple, but as a whole, it took me a year to get the courage to go for it.
The Vhost Wizard actually did the work.  I just went in to clean it up and
add associated domains.

The process is not as self-evident from the front end as it is hind sight
and I would suggest a little tolerance and restraint for the newbies.
That's what mentors do.  And they may help you someday.

And yes, I did read the manual.  Several times.  Even printed the
appropriate pages (to print more would be a waste of trees).  Took notes.

They are called reference manuals for a reason.  And I remember those huge
green binders that DEC put out for VAX.  Neglected reading them but opted
for the IBM 360 Error Messages and Codes as my nightstand fare.  Put me out
faster and didn't weigh as much.

Smile folks,
Charles

All,

To configure virtual hosts, you have to know two things.  First, what
this means and how it works technically.  For that, the Xitami manual
is pretty detailed and I'd say, yes, RTFM.  It's the authoratitive
explanation.  Second, how to set the server config files to actually
make a new vhost.  Since there are several options, the advice of
others may help.

I might just keep the GUI version running. Before on Win2k it had
problems and would crash but now that I am on XP it seems to be stable.

It's probably starting in the wrong directory.

What version of xitami are you using?  I'm running Version 2.5b4 & get   
Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Errors often on XP.

I have runtime error problems on XP Pro SP2 very often, once every 
two-three days. The crashes are not reported in the crashlog and 
automatic recovery fails. I have tried several xitami versions. I didn't 
know this was a known isue on XP?

Albert,
Haven't had a crash since I rebuilt the PC. Describe your crash, what
happens when it crashes, what else is running at the time of the crash?
Any idea how many people are on at the time? How many domains do you
have running on it? Are you running the FTP portion?

Ron

Hi Ron,

Currently I'm running 2.4d11. Xitami pops up with a VC runtime 
error leaving nothing in the crash log. Although the crash-recovery 
is on, it simply stops. Haven't been able to intercept the exact error 
number, but I expect it soon to appear again.

I'm not running FTP with Xitami. It simply wasn't stable enough. It 
caused Xitami to crash too. Below is a small snippet of the crash 
log conceirning this (I now use ServU which is stable as a rock so 
far):

Abort at smtsock:Send-Timeout-Event-To-Self:ES1 (Getting-Event, 
No-Activity-Event)

the files to be ftp't are aprox. 1mb of size

I'm using Xitami in a combined soap/web environment. The soap 
clients are communicating with a soap cgi through Xitami. The 
webapplication is running agains an application server. The latest 
crash occurred during a soap session. At the moment there were 
no webclients in the system, only one soap user. It occurred after 
a connection got timed-out and a reconnect was established. I 
haven't been able to reproduce the problem on our development 
system. There are no warnings in the applications running below 
Xitami, nor the client. Xitami just quits with the above message, as 
it's been doing several times now. The webapplication and soap 
stuff is written in Borland Delphi 6 sp 3.

I know it's a little bit vague. As soon I have more info I get back 
here. It's just that I like to know if there are know isues with Xitami 
on XP. I'm using it for years now without any trouble. I have a 
feeling that it has to do with some lingering connections, but I 
cannot prove it.

Best regards,
Albert

Hi Ron,

Currently I'm running 2.4d11. Xitami pops up with a VC runtime 
error leaving nothing in the crash log. Although the crash-recovery 
is on, it simply stops. Haven't been able to intercept the exact error 
number, but I expect it soon to appear again.

I'm not running FTP with Xitami. It simply wasn't stable enough. It 
caused Xitami to crash too. Below is a small snippet of the crash 
log conceirning this (I now use ServU which is stable as a rock so 
far):

the files to be ftp't are aprox. 1mb of size

I'm using Xitami in a combined soap/web environment. The soap 
clients are communicating with a soap cgi through Xitami. The 
webapplication is running agains an application server. The latest 
crash occurred during a soap session. At the moment there were 
no webclients in the system, only one soap user. It occurred after 
a connection got timed-out and a reconnect was established. I 
haven't been able to reproduce the problem on our development 
system. There are no warnings in the applications running below 
Xitami, nor the client. Xitami just quits with the above message, as 
it's been doing several times now. The webapplication and soap 
stuff is written in Borland Delphi 6 sp 3.

I know it's a little bit vague. As soon I have more info I get back 
here. It's just that I like to know if there are know isues with Xitami 
on XP. I'm using it for years now without any trouble. I have a 
feeling that it has to do with some lingering connections, but I 
cannot prove it.

Best regards,
Albert

 From theXitami Help Docs, "Xitami supports CGI programs in Perl, C, or 
any other language that your system supports. In general, CGI program 
written for web servers such as Apache and NCSA httpd will run unchanged 
with Xitami."

So you just goto http://www.perl.com/  & download & install the version 
of Perl that runs on your system.

So do I with Xitami  2.5c1. Run the default htm file that came with 
xitami & then look at the cgierr.log. If you can't figure what it is 
telling you post it & someone should be able to figure out what is 
wrong. The usual problem is file paths so be sure they are correct. 
Xitami & Perl have problems with the spaces that XP allows in folder names.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I use windows XP and I am trying to send an e-mail via a form (CGI). I am 
testing on a local server using Xitami 2.5c2.
All information that is I require is being saved but the e-mail notification

I've downloaded and attempted to install xitami on my Linux and the
build scripts all fail because they seem to be looking for a compiler
named "c".  Am I missing something here, because the compiler is
normally "cc", or a few others, but I've never seen "c" as a compiler
name.  So what is this "c" thing, and should xitami really be looking
for it?  Most importantly though is how do I make this install work as
intended?

Thanks
