Thanks... I'm sorry to be an uninformed newbie & keep asking questions, =
but would it be possible for you to explain to me how to do this, or =
what I should do exactly?  I understand computers & the internet fairly =
well, but I'm pretty new to networking.  I found a place in my router's =
configuration page to forward ports, etc., but I don't know what I'm =
doing once I get there.  I also dont know how to assign an internal IP =
address, or what to do with it once that's been done.

Thanks again for the help,
Steve

  Looks like you will need to port-forward port 80 in your router to =
your Windows hosting machine.  Also, you will need to permanently assign =
an internal IP address to your hosting machine.

Hi Steve,

Maybe it would be best to really understand what your router does for you.
I'm not familiar with the Linksys, I personally have D-Link. So details may
vary, but the jist of the story should be fairly familiar.  I am, by no
means, an expert, but here's my take on it.

When someone sends a request to your domain name, say www.mydomain.com, it
really goes to an IP number, connected to the internet, say, 24.86.62.150
(don't try this address, I just made it up). Now, that would be, in our
example, the IP address of your router.

What your router does with that request, is that it looks up in its list of
information to see if the requests for the port specified should be
redirected somewhere. So let's assume this was a webpage request, on port
80. Your router needs to know to which computer to forward that request. So
say it goes to your computer at 192.168.0.121. The router will take that ip
packet, and forward it to that "behind the wall" address to be dealt with.

What you need to tell your router, is that whenever there is a packet coming
in for port 80 (the standard port for web servers), it needs to be forwarded
to 192.168.0.121 (or whichever LAN IP number your computer has.

I hope this is helping you.

Cheers,

Real Martel

Try this site http://ozcableguy.com/routerfaq.html#2.11
- the whole site is excellent reading to understand routers and
networking. Read the port forwarding thoroughly - you'll need to use
this to get Kazaa running as well.

To assign an IP all you need to do is change the connection properties
on the PC running the web server from "obtain IP automatically" to
manually specifying the IP you want.

(in XP or Win2k - right click the connection icon, Status, Properties
(button), Internet Protocol (highlight this), Properties (button))

Make sure the IP you choose matches the IP and subnet of your router's
internal IP - eg.

router  192.168.0.1
PC running server  192.168.0.2 subnet 255.255.255.0

OR (say)

router 10.0.0.1
PC 10.0.0.2 subnet 255.255.255.0

(ie it depends on your router)

Steven,

Except for OS differences, I already do what you want to do with a =
Linksys wireless cable router.  This is what you do.

First, determine the internal IP address for the network card that is =
attached to your router.  Each card or interface can actually have its =
own address (used or not).  Click "Networks" in the system tray  and =
choose "ethernet".  In one of those tabs, it has your configurations =
settings (don't have an XP on me right now so shooting from memory).  =
Write down your IP address, the gateway, mask, and DNS addresses.  It is =
possible to use that IP in your router settings, but it is technically =
dynamic (changeable) so it would be wise to set it to a static address, =
but you can do it later.  You can also run "IPCONFIG" to get this info, =
as long as you choose the correct interface.

The reason I'm suggesting using your current IP address is just to get =
it running.  When you set your address manually, you must also set the =
gateway (your router), mask (that 255.255.x.x number), and the Domain =
Name lookup (DNS) addresses.  Since you set these up manually, no =
request is made to the DHCP server for this stuff.  Also, choose an =
address the mask likes.

Now, armed with your notes, go into your router's setup.  Usually you =
enter its IP (198.168.1.1) or whatever and password.  Choose the =
ADVANCED tab then "DMZ Host".  Enter your server's IP address here and =
apply it.

Your server is now open to the world - completely open.  As if it were =
the only computer connected to the modem.  The DMZ Host will direct ALL =
traffic to this machine so a firewall is REALLY important!  All your =
peer sharing stuff should also work now for the same reason.

Test that it works before setting up a manual IP address, remembering to =
include the the gateway, mask and DNS host addresses in the server's =
settings.  You will need to change the DMZ address before it works =
again.  Rebooting may also help.

You could have setup Port Forwarding to forward a range of ports to this =
server, but why.  Port Forwarding will be useful if you have different =
computer perform different tasks.  Mail here, DB there, FTP to that one, =
etc...  Then you need to know who does what to which port.  Right now =
its a simple application with a simple solution, mostly.

Happy Multitasking,
Charles

With Xitami (Win32) web server I would like to password protect a folder
(subdirectory) for public access and at the same time have this folder
available without passwords on selected IP addresses (our LAN). Is this
possible and how can it be done?

In other words in xitami.aut I would like to do both of the following at
the same time:

[SpecialFolder]

[SpecialFolder]
   All=*                       # Allow all local users
   Webmask=192.1.2.*           #   to access this without a password

No.

One way for workaround is - to use virtual hosts. In one host make
access for LAN only (without password); in second - access for every
address, but with password.

Best wishes!

My guess would be that the script contains a reference to a 'success page'
that isn't there on your new installation.  Does the 404 error message
indicate which page is not found?

  Subject: [Xitami] Problems using CGI and PHP on Xitami


  I am using Xitami version 2.5b6 on Windows XP (home edition), I have
Active Perl 5.6 and PHP 4.3 installed as well. I am using some scripts (some
are cgi / perl and some are PHP).  These scripts are used to post messages,
access restricted parts of my site, etc..etc, the problem is this (using the
message posting script for an example) I type in my message, click submit,
and it goes to an HTTP 404 Error page. But if I go back to the page where I
can view the messages, they are there, it posted them. Why does it go to
this HTML 404 Error message page, and how can I get it to work correctly?

  One note: I used all these scripts with another webserver I use to have on
my system before I got Xitami and they worked fine.

  Please help?

Okay - reposting -=20

Steven,

Except for OS differences, I already do what you want to do with a =
Linksys wireless cable router.  This is what you do.

First, determine the internal IP address for the network card that is =
attached to your router.  Each card or interface can actually have its =
own address (used or not).  Click "Networks" in the system tray  and =
choose "ethernet".  In one of those tabs, it has your configurations =
settings (don't have an XP on me right now so shooting from memory).  =
Write down your IP address, the gateway, mask, and DNS addresses.  It is =
possible to use that IP in your router settings, but it is technically =
dynamic (changeable) so it would be wise to set it to a static address, =
but you can do it later.  You can also run "IPCONFIG" to get this info, =
as long as you choose the correct interface.

The reason I'm suggesting using your current IP address is just to get =
it running.  When you set your address manually, you must also set the =
gateway (your router), mask (that 255.255.x.x number), and the Domain =
Name lookup (DNS) addresses.  Since you set these up manually, no =
request is made to the DHCP server for this stuff.  Also, choose an =
address the mask likes.

Now, armed with your notes, go into your router's setup.  Usually you =
enter its IP (198.168.1.1) or whatever and password.  Choose the =
ADVANCED tab then "DMZ Host".  Enter your server's IP address here and =
apply it.

Your server is now open to the world - completely open.  As if it were =
the only computer connected to the modem.  The DMZ Host will direct ALL =
traffic to this machine so a firewall is REALLY important!  All your =
peer sharing stuff should also work now for the same reason.

Test that it works before setting up a manual IP address, remembering to =
include the the gateway, mask and DNS host addresses in the server's =
settings.  You will need to change the DMZ address before it works =
again.  Rebooting may also help.

You could have setup Port Forwarding to forward a range of ports to this =
server, but why.  Port Forwarding will be useful if you have different =
computer perform different tasks.  Mail here, DB there, FTP to that one, =
etc...  Then you need to know who does what to which port.  Right now =
its a simple application with a simple solution, mostly.

Much luck,
Charles

  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>
  <DIV>Steven,</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>Except for OS differences, I already do what you want to do with =
a=20
  Linksys wireless cable router.&nbsp; This is what you do.</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>First, determine&nbsp;the internal IP address for the network =
card that=20
  is attached to your router.&nbsp; Each card or interface =
can&nbsp;actually=20
  have its own address (used or not).&nbsp; Click "Networks" in the =
system=20
  tray&nbsp; and choose "ethernet".&nbsp; In one of those tabs, it has =
your=20
  configurations&nbsp;settings (don't have an XP on me right now so =
shooting=20
  from memory).&nbsp; Write down your IP address, the gateway, mask, and =
DNS=20
  addresses.&nbsp; It is possible to use that IP in your router =
settings, but it=20
  is technically dynamic (changeable) so it would be wise to set =
it&nbsp;to a=20
  static address, but you can do it later.&nbsp; You can also run =
"IPCONFIG" to=20
  get this info, as long as you choose the correct interface.</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>The reason I'm suggesting using your current&nbsp;IP address is =
just to=20
  get it running.&nbsp; When you set your address manually,&nbsp;you=20
  must&nbsp;also&nbsp;set the gateway (your router), mask (that =
255.255.x.x=20
  number), and the Domain Name lookup (DNS) addresses.&nbsp; Since you =
set these=20
  up manually, no request is made to the DHCP server for this =
stuff.&nbsp; Also,=20
  choose an address the mask likes.</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>Now, armed with your notes,&nbsp;go into&nbsp;your router's =
setup.&nbsp;=20
  Usually you enter its IP (198.168.1.1) or whatever and password.&nbsp; =
Choose=20
  the ADVANCED tab then "DMZ&nbsp;Host".&nbsp; Enter your server's IP =
address=20
  here and apply it.</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>Your server is now open to the world - completely open.&nbsp; As =
if it=20
  were the only computer connected to the modem.&nbsp; The DMZ Host will =

  direct&nbsp;ALL traffic&nbsp;to this machine so a firewall is REALLY=20
  important!&nbsp; All your peer sharing stuff should also work =
now&nbsp;for the=20
  same reason.</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>Test that it works before setting up a manual IP address, =
remembering to=20
  include the the gateway, mask and DNS&nbsp;host addresses in the =
server's=20
  settings.&nbsp; You will need to change the DMZ address before it =
works=20
  again.&nbsp; Rebooting may also help.</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>You could have setup Port Forwarding to forward a range of ports =
to this=20
  server, but why.&nbsp; Port Forwarding will be useful if you have =
different=20
  computer perform different tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mail here, DB there, FTP =
to that=20
  one, etc...&nbsp; Then you need to know who does what to which =
port.&nbsp;=20
  Right now its a simple application with a simple solution, =
mostly.</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>Much luck,</DIV>
  <DIV>Charles</DIV></DIV>

I think you should modify the default.aut instead of the xitami.aut

I know this has been addressed before but I couldn't find it so forgive me
if I'm rehashing old stuff.

I want to run some secured sites and some not secured sites. Can that be
done on Xitami Pro or do I need both version? Also how hard is it to upgrade
to pro?

Thanks guys,
Ron

Message-ID: <40060FDD.30202@atsi.ca>

Hello:

I have been a user of Xitami for over a year. I have been very grateful 
to have usch a powerful and reliable piece of software to use. Thank you 
to the author(s).

I seem to have a problem with 2.4 crashing when a client tries to send 
what would seem to be a normal amount of files to the server. I have 
been running 2.4d9 and then tried to upgrade to 2.4d10 by copying the 
exes to the appropriate places, I think.

Anyway, this problem persists and I am facing the prospect of disabling 
the ftp server part and installing another ftp only server to fix this 
problem. Is there any solution I have missed possibly from reading what 
I can find?

Thx in advance for any assistance.

I had a similar problem and the feedback I remember from Xitami was that the
FTP service was not intended for robust service.  It was suggested that
another FTP server be used.

What I ended up with was War FTP.  It runs as an application or as a
service.  Never have had a hiccup in two years.  You can get it at
http://www.warftp.org/.

In your defaults.cfg file (example)

[Virtual-hosts]
     Mail.verfaillie.com=mail.cfg
     Shop.verfaillie.be=shop.cfg
     Shop.verfaillie.com=shop.cfg
     Web.verfaillie.be=verfa.cfg


That's your mail.cfg (complete, example)

[Server]
     webpages=webpages/mail

[Accesslog]
     Filename=mail.log


When somebody go to mail.verfaillie.com, the mail.cfg is checked, points to 
the "mail" directory.
Verify that you have correct DNS pointing to your server for all domains.

In your defaults.cfg file (example)

[Virtual-hosts]
     Mail.verfaillie.com=mail.cfg
     Shop.verfaillie.be=shop.cfg
     Shop.verfaillie.com=shop.cfg
     Web.verfaillie.be=verfa.cfg


That's your mail.cfg (complete, example)

[Server]
     webpages=webpages/mail

[Accesslog]
     Filename=mail.log


When somebody go to mail.verfaillie.com, the mail.cfg is checked, points to
the "mail" directory.
Verify that you have correct DNS pointing to your server for all domains.

Are you sure it's "default.cfg" and not "defaults.cfg"?
What shows up in your logfile?
Is something written in it? (then the correct config file is read in but 
the webpages directory is not accessed)
Is nothing written in it then the config file chicagoelegance was never read.

Don't forget to restart the webserver after modifications so the config 
files are read in again.

First: try short (8.3) filenames

Then: look if anywhere is assigned something by ip adresses, like
ip-adr=any.cfg or *=any.cfg

> [Server]
> Webpages=webpages/chicagoelegance
Here put full path instead, e.g. c:\files\web\chicago\ (where your htm
actually are)
Also try short 8.3 directory and file names

I finally got bold enough to set up my virtual hosting and it actually
works.  It would be easier to at least set things up with the Web Based
Administration screens and come in later to the different .cfg files and
tweak them if needed.

To get to the WBA screens, there is a web page shortcut in your xitami
directory called "redirect" that refers to the at http://127.0.0.1/admin (if
not, that's where you go).  Hopefully you set up your admin accts
accordingly.

The "VHost Wizard" option helps set up the cfg files for each domain.  Tell
it where you want stuff placed and it will set it up for you.  The 8
character filename rule would be safe (.cfg is automatic).

Now, go into "Virtual Hosts" Configuration.  It lists all your VH configs
set up previously.  Hit the "Defaults..." button to access the default
configurations.  On the right are server options.  Choose "vhost."  This is
where you equate domain names to config files.  You can point multiple
domain names at the same config file.

examples:
  www.thisdomain.com       thisdom.cfg
  thisdomain.com                thisdom.cfg
  www.thisdomain.net          thisdom.cfg
 thatdomain.org                 thatdom.cfg
 media.anotherone.com      media.cfg

Each type of domain reference has to be defined.  Found that out the hard
way.  Oh, this sets up the "defaults.cfg" entries for vhosting.  If you
don't enter the "Default configuration screen first, I'm not sure where it
goes.  Also, the vhost screen in only so long.  You can add more or change
entries in the defaults.cfg file directly.  A cute bonus is that the wizard
way sorts the names for you.  Woo-hoo.

Basehost.cfg can be set up similarly.  A little advice: sketch out your
directory structure before you start; it will help continuity.  I moved my
"webpages" out of the Xitami folder and reorganized in c:\public.  It has
helped to locate stuff quicker.  The only question left is what to do with
all the new log files.

All you need now is your DNS to point your domains to your IP.  A Dynamic
DNS would be useful and quicker to propagate changes.  And redirection to
non-standard ports works really well too and eliminates scanners and buffer
overloaders.  Robots still come in, though.

Much Luck,

Charles

  Thanks for the help!  However, I did try this.  I started by first trying 
to make that entry into my defaults,  and THEN, I even went into the 
web-based setup and entered this info into the alias section there!!  I just 
pointed it to: D:\Xitami2    (just like that),  hoping to point to the 
second occurrence of Xitami that I have installed on my D:\ drive....  It 
still does not work..  A remote user who tries to access this, says that the 
link to this section is not even clickable!   Any other help or advice, or 
maybe showing me what I'm doing wrong, or exactly how to go about this, 
would be greatly appreciated! Thanks again, and have a good day!  Please 
help with this, as my C:\ drive is FULL!

Hello,

at "Configuration" - "Aliases" page in the web based admin should be an
entry like:

Alias:    Points to path:
test    d:\xitami2\

Inside d:\xitami2 directory should be an index.htm.
Then, if somebody types at his browser: http://www.domain.com/test/ then
should appear index.htm from d:\xitami2.

Also you can test it at the "Configuration" screen inside Web based Admin:
at the bottom there's an input box called "Test URI Mapping". (Not with all
versions of Xitami.)
There you can type the  http://www.domain.com/test and you see to which file
or dir it does point,

Martin

Tom, your wording in this post seems to indicate that you have installed
Xitami on the d drive also. ???Two installs of the server??? If so, the guys
have been trying to point out how the server installed on the c drive can
use the d drives space not using another installation. If I'm wrong on this
sorry ahead of time, if not you have two installs fighting each other.

Hi Folks,

A quick administrive note: mail to the Xitami mailing list is now passed
through a spam scanner, and spam messages (scoring > 5 in SpamAssassin)
are silently discarded.  This is primarily to eliminate the spam
messages which arrive every day in the "message from non-list-member"
file approval.

I don't think this should interfere at all with normal messages to the
mailing list, but if anyone does encounter any problems then please let
me know directly (ewen@imatix.com).

from the outside (internet), people are  going to 24.209.120.13 which is
your router. you need to allow them through the router to your pc that has
the web server.

i always use NAT for this. do a search and you'll find tons of info. if your
router supports nat it will be in the help documentation for your router.

basically you have to translate port 80 (www) from your outside address
(24.209.120.13) to your inside address (192.168.1.2).

Steven,
This should have worked.  Port forwarding, of course, will work but the =
problem is if you want to run other servers (FTP, Mail, streamed media) =
on this computer, you will have to forward all associated ports =
accordingly and is the solution if these services are on different =
computers.

DMZ is meant to forward everything to one machine.  I think it's a =
gaming thing.

Since your site functions, oh well...

Congrats,
Charles

  Subject: [Xitami] web server w/ router (again)


  Ive posted a couple of times now about trying to run the xitami web server
from my computer.  It's set up pn a broadband connection that is shared with
a Linksys router between two computers.  I set this computer (Windows XP)
to have a manual IP of 192.168.1.2  (the router's IP is 192.168.1.1) with
the subnet mask being set to 255.255.255.0, the default gateway as
192.168.1.1.  When I ran ipconfig/all I got 3 DNS numbers and put the first
two in as my primary and alternate DNS servers.  I then set the router up in
the advanced/DMZ HOST IP ADDRESS to be 192.168.1.2 and turned the Xitami web
server on.  When I enter http://192.168.1.1 into the browser it goes to the
router set-up, which is good.  When I try to access pages on the internet,
it works, which is good.  When I enter http://192.168.1.2 it loads the
index.html page I put in the Xitami server folder, which is great.  Here's
the problem, however... when I look up my IP address online (the one
assigned to me via my ISP) I get 24.209.120.13.  When I enter
http://24.209.120.13 into my browser, I get nothing, which is bad.  It seems
that I have everything set up right and straightened out, but I still cant
get access to the web site Im trying to host from this computer.  What am I
doing wrong, or what else can I do?

Message-ID: <009801c3e68d$a56fca50$d8a5560a@amer.cisco.com>

Is there a way to prevent the Xitami FTP server from trying other ports
for the FTP Data Port (default = 20) when using Active FTP?  I need the
server to only use TCP 20 for troubleshooting purposes.  Thanks in
advance.

Thanks,

Chestnut,

Entering your external IP WILL access your web site, even when typed at =
the server (just tested it).  Your access.log file will show your =
gateway address (in Steve's case 192.168.1.1) instead of the usual =
external access IP.  Sometimes, in my instance anyway, you have to enter =
the "http://" along with the IP.  But ... if virtual hosting is active =
and there's nothing at base host, then you get nothing.

I don't understand why it doesn't work the same as my operation.  For =
the sake of comparison:

Router is a Linksys BEFW11S4 wireless 4-port (first version, nearly 2 =
years old)
Router's address is changed to 10.168.1.1 and is also the gateway
Subnet mask is 255.255.248.0 (I don't know why)
DHCP services are on with addresses starting at 10.168.1.100
DMZ Host is set to 10.168.1.50 (notice outside DHCP territory but =
shouldn't matter)
    (*I have tried Port Forward and that works slick too!)

Computer is a hand-me-down P166 that I just upped the mem to 256MB; =
3.25GB HD.
Running a Xitami 2.5c1 console (xidos.exe) in a DOS windows on Windows =
98SE (does service work?)
HTTP port is changed to 1975 and FTP is disabled
Virtual Host is active (and actually working) but base host is blank.
Server is manually configure to 10.168.1.50
Gateway is entered as 10.168.1.1 along with subnet mask 255.255.255.0
DNS IPs are also entered manually and can be found on the router's =
Status page
Other servers installed: Fictional Daemon (FTP and Telnet) and Mercury =
Mail
Also on board: MySQL and PHP

I think that's all.  Hope this is useful.

Thanks Charles but I think you missed my point.  I still want to use the
FTP Server - what I want to prevent is Xitami "scanning for free ports":

"data-port 
Specifies the port at which data connections will be made. Xitami scans
for free ports, so this is simply the start of a range of ports. The
port is shifted by whatever value was used for the server portbase. 
Default: 200. "



Thanks,
John

  Chestnut,

  Entering your external IP WILL access your web site, even when typed =
at the server (just tested it).  Your access.log file will show your =
gateway address (in Steve's case 192.168.1.1) instead of the usual =
external access IP.  Sometimes, in my instance anyway, you have to enter =
the "http://" along with the IP.  But ... if virtual hosting is active =
and there's nothing at base host, then you get nothing.

  I don't understand why it doesn't work the same as my operation.  For =
the sake of comparison:

  Router is a Linksys BEFW11S4 wireless 4-port (first version, nearly 2 =
years old)
  Router's address is changed to 10.168.1.1 and is also the gateway
  Subnet mask is 255.255.248.0 (I don't know why)
  DHCP services are on with addresses starting at 10.168.1.100
  DMZ Host is set to 10.168.1.50 (notice outside DHCP territory but =
shouldn't matter)
      (*I have tried Port Forward and that works slick too!)

  Computer is a hand-me-down P166 that I just upped the mem to 256MB; =
3.25GB HD.
  Running a Xitami 2.5c1 console (xidos.exe) in a DOS windows on Windows =
98SE (does service work?)
  HTTP port is changed to 1975 and FTP is disabled
  Virtual Host is active (and actually working) but base host is blank.
  Server is manually configure to 10.168.1.50
  Gateway is entered as 10.168.1.1 along with subnet mask 255.255.255.0
  DNS IPs are also entered manually and can be found on the router's =
Status page
  Other servers installed: Fictional Daemon (FTP and Telnet) and Mercury =
Mail
  Also on board: MySQL and PHP

  I think that's all.  Hope this is useful.

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Okay, the router does it. Now, I still don't
see 
why he would want to access the web server on HIS lan by using the external
IP. 
As he said he is able to access by the local IP, and as I said, and one
other if 
I'm not wrong, am able to access the site using the external IP, what would
be 
the reason for accessing it from the lan using the external IP??? It seems
all 
forwarding is being done and the site IS up and running
properly.</FONT></DIV>

  <DIV>Entering your external IP&nbsp;WILL access your web&nbsp;site, even
when 
  typed at the server (just tested it).&nbsp; Your access.log file will
show 
  your gateway address (in Steve's case 192.168.1.1) instead of the usual 
  external access IP.&nbsp; Sometimes, in my instance anyway, you have to
enter 
  the "<A href='http://"'>http://"</A> along with the IP.&nbsp; But
...&nbsp;if 
  virtual hosting is active and there's nothing at base host, then you get 
  nothing.</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>I don't understand why it doesn't work the same as my
operation.&nbsp; 
  For the sake of comparison:</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV>Router is a Linksys BEFW11S4 wireless 4-port (first version, nearly
2 
  years old)</DIV>
  <DIV>Router's address is changed to 10.168.1.1 and is also the
gateway</DIV>
  <DIV>Subnet mask is 255.255.248.0 (I don't know why)</DIV>
  <DIV>DHCP services are on with addresses starting at 10.168.1.100</DIV>
  <DIV>DMZ Host is set to 10.168.1.50 (notice outside DHCP territory but 
  shouldn't matter)</DIV>
  <DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (*I have tried Port Forward and that works slick 
  too!)</DIV>

  <DIV>Gateway&nbsp;is entered as 10.168.1.1 along with subnet&nbsp;mask

Sorry, my bad, misread your note.
Didn't know it scanned.  When I ran the FTP service, it was shifted to port
1916.  Maybe directly setting the port might help.  I had download issues
with the FTP service (premature completeness) so switched to another.

[cut another faux pas]

I did find this in Xitami.cfg (for use in defaults.cfg):

#   Specifies the port at which data connections will be made. Xitami
#   scans for free ports, so this is simply the start of a range of
#   ports. The port is shifted by whatever value was used for the
#   server portbase.

[ftp]
    data-port=200

Whatever that means.  It may either allow you to shift the starting scan
point or set the starting scan point (say at 20) and it might stop there.

Don't know.  Worth a shot.

Much luck,
Charles
