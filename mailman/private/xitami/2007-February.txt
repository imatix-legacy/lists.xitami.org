Why should you use two copies of Xitami and two different ports?
Use the vhost feature of the server.

You can host any number of domains from a single server using one port, one
ip and one server.

Linda:

You don't have to run a seperate copy of Xitami.  If you aren't aware you 
can have many virtual domains exist on a single IP address.  Each virtual 
domain would have its own config file.  However, if you are aware of this 
and still want a second copy of xitami running then you would need a second 
install of xitami (in a second folder) and you would need to do a minimum of 
two things:

1.  change the service name of the second copy - by default ximati uses its 
names as the windows process service identifier. In the defaults.cfg of the 
second install under the [Win32] section you would need to change 
"Service-name" to something other than "Xitami" (this is assuming you left 
the first install copy as the default service name.).  Ideally you would 
want to change the "Service-text" too, but that is just the service 
description so its not truly needed.

2.  for the port, in the defaults.cfg file uner [Server] you would need to 
change the "portbase" to the appropriate number.  If you don't see it there 
then you can add it:
    portbase= 0        # e.g. 5000 for port 5080

by the example after the #, the default port (aka: base port) is port 80 
thats one reaons why you might not see it under the [Server] section, but if 
it is or you have already added it then note that portbase=0 IS the HTTP 
port 80.  So if you wanted to change your secondary Xitami install to port 
81, then set portbase=1, to set it to 8080, portbase=8000.  Basically, what 
ever number you want to use, subtract 80 from that number and that will be 
your portbase.

I probably did overkill on the explanation but its late my time right now 
and I have sort of gone into zombie mode.  :-)

Marc,

I run 3 copies of Xitami running for 3 very specific reasons.  Two copies
have multiple virtual domains and the third has none.  There are many
reasons.

Hello all,

i'm looking for a simple forum software that could run on Xitami (or any
other server) without much configuration. Server is windows 2000 or 2003.
The forum is not for me, but for an organisation and they don't know
anything about computers. I've tried a WAMP (windows-apache-mySQL-PHP)
solution, but it's really too complicated for the users to maintain.
A "free forum" is not really an option, since it comes with lot of
advertising and there is nearly no control about the posts (lot of spam!).
Freeware or shareware OK.

There are many forums out there:

http://www.forummatrix.org/

There are a couple forums written in ASP, but most are written for a 
WAMP/WIMP environment (Windows-IIS-MySQL-PHP).  A few support SQL Server 
and a couple of them use plain ol' text files (i.e. no database).  Some 
of the commercial solutions offer to help set up the board and upgrade 
it on behalf of the user (for a hefty annual fee).

(YahooGroups?  Not exactly a web forum, but might be worth checking out.)

I wrote my own, and it turns out it was much more simple than most of the 
shareware/freeware out there - a pretty small and optimized database (just a 
few tables) with just a few perl scripts.

You know, I might be inclined to write a Xitami Forum that would share in 
the mailing list.  I can write a script that parses any incoming mail that 
had a new topic which would be the start of a new disucssion and any 
subsequent reply "Re:" would be added to that discussion all organized by 
timestamp.  So not only would we have the regular email list we all receive 
but then the everything would also be captured to a usable forum.

Its been a while since I wrote an email parser but it shouldn't be too 
hard - just have to capture the headers and search/insert into the DB from 
there.  anmyone want to join me on this one?  I imagine parseing out all the 
reply'd to info could be a bit difficult or weeding through each Replied to 
email to grab legitimate response lines.  Except for that part I think it 
would be rather easy to do the whole thing.

Take a look at the [Server] section of the "Configuration" page for
info on the ipaddress, portbase, base-host, and hostname options as
well as the "Virtual Hosts" section of the documentation.

Since Xitami can use either IP based or name based virtual hosts, and
since your ISP has set you up with multiple names on the same IP, I
would skip the setting up of a separate copy of Xitami and use name
based virtual hosts.

Message-ID: <1538929512.20070201164510@yahoo.ca>

Hello All,

  Just a brief note that with some help I have been able to compile
  Xitami from source code! For those of you that want to know, here's
  how I did it:

  From www.imatix.com download any one of the tools "Libero, SMT, GSL
  or SFL" The download's page lets you download "Rbase_1_0_src.zip" or
  "...src.tar.gz" for all of them. Then get the source for Xitami
  or Xitami-Pro or both. The web pages and other sources of
  information indicate that Windows 2000-Pro is the preferred platform
  to compile on, so if you have a fast enough processor and XP then
  download from Microsoft their free Virtual PC and set up a Windows
  2000-Pro machine.

  Next extract the rbase archive to the virtual machine's disk. Now
  open a command prompt and change to the ".../rbase/src" directory.
  Type build at the command prompt and watch the files get compiled.
  You will have a new directory called imatix created for you.

  Go to Control Panel | System | Environment Variables and edit the
  path statement to include the ...\imatix\bin\. directory.

  Next extract the source for Xitami into it's own directory which
  we'll call ".../xiopen_2_5_src". In the command Prompt window change
  to this directory and type "build". Watch the files being compiled.
  You will have a new directory created for you called
  ".../imatix/xitami-25" where you will find the compiled contents.
  Simply move it to where ever you want and start it up.

  Topics for my further investigation: Will they compile under XP? and
  BSD? Once those are determined then it's time for some changes to
  the Xitami source.

  I hope this helps.

I think i will go that way too for my forum.
I'm much more confortable in writing the whole thing in powerbasic than in 
getting a WAMP system running, fine-tuning it... and keeping it running, and 
that just for a forum with 10 posts a week!
