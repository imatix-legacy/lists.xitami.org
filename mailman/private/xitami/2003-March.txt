Hi, I have a problem with some log-files. I'm using the following inside
a CFG file:

[Accesslog]
    Filename = "familie-ney_de_access.log"
    Cycle-how = concat
    Cycle-arg = familie-ney_de_access.archive
    Format = CLFX
 
The problem is that the old logfiles are not concatenated to the archive
file on a daily base. There exists only one active log file and the
information isn't appened and therefore lost if the cycling happens. Has
anyone a hint for me? Robert

Does anyone know of a software package that allows
redirection of a rs 232 port to Ethernet port.  I have an application
that runs locally to control a device via the com port.  What I would
like to to is to have those commands sent over the net to a remote
computer and then again redirect that out the rs 232 port.  I found
some packages but they require connecting two com ports on the=20
controlling machine and I would like to avoid that.

Thanks

Xitami doesn't use MySQL.  Perl or PHP will use MySQL if they are 
configured to use it.

Subject: [Xitami] New User Question - Server Intrusion
Message-ID: <100377579545.20030305190046@rogerbrown.no-ip.org>

I am a new user to Xitami and not at all conversant with running a
server. I'm using Xitami for a self hosted site.

Along with normal traffic I'm getting the odd idiot running intrusion
type scripts (which I expected). I am concerned though that some
server responses to the script are other than 404 indicating, I
assume, that some response was obtained.

For example:


203.197.248.101 - - [05/Mar/2003:17:30:45 +1000] "GET /scripts/..%%35%63../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+dir HTTP/1.0" 200 -1 "" ""

I believe the server is correctly set up - there are no server aliases
but php is enabled. The relevant parts of defaults.cfg are:

[Filter]
    .php = "C:\\PHP\\php.exe"

[Ftp]
    Enabled = "0"
    Root = "c:/downloads"

[Security]
    Dirlist = "0"
    safepaths=1
    Filename = "defaults.aut"

[Server]
    Priority = "1"
    Webpages = "c:/documents and settings/roger brown/my documents/my website"
    portbase=0

I have firewall software (Tiny) which blocks pretty much everything
that other than known applications - there is no indication from its
logs of trojan activity. Nor is there any indication of unusual data
usage from my broadband ISP's usage meter.
    
Can anyone elighten me about these intrusion attempts

Those URLs are invalid syntax. They are carefully crafted to confuse
MS IIS webserver. They work up out of the wwwroot directory then
down into the Windows directory and run programs. That's what can
happen when children write webservers: other smarter children find
ways to break their toys.

Xitami can't be tricked that way.

On a few of those it does show other than "404". What's happening:
Xitami tries to parse the invalid URL, chokes on the illegal part
"%%", and simply truncates the URL at that point. The result is
"/scripts/..", which simplifies to "/", so Xitami delivers your top
home page and calls it a success. The attacker, who had hoped for a
file-listing (thus proving that he or she could access CMD and
execute arbitrary commands) will not consider this a success.

It is not possible to open access log files because they are in use by

If you're on a Windows system, just use NOTEPAD
to view the log files. It doesn't try to put its own lock
on the file like, for example, WORDPAD does.

It seems there are lots of people wanting to see the logs real time.
If pushed enough, i can write you a small windows console application (exe) 
that shows the last entries in the log file.

Hi Marc

Nice program but it seems to have display problems (at least on my
system[XP/pro]). Apparently it doesn't put line breaks at the end of each log
entry when it prints them to the screen. Also it doesn't seem to clear the
screen properly or whatever because previous command prompt text gets mixed up
with the program's output. If you can work these out, Xilog will be very useful
for me and, I'm sure, many others. Thanks a lot for writing it!

No need, there is already a perfect utility already written. Use one of the 
many *nix ports of "less". The follow command will do just what is needed here.

Does Xitami can solely run:
 ASP - No.  You have to get a seperate application and install it.
 JSP - Not directly.  You have to install and tweak a JSP runtime as 
with the ASP.

Xitami seems to run best with PHP.

What is the IP address of the PC that is running Xitami?

is your Xitami machine behind a firewall? if so, do you have port 80 mapped to the 
machine? even if Xitami is on the same machine as your firewall solution, you still 
need to create the port mapping.

I have an similar question? If you run a router, and your web server is
running on a machine behind the router, why can only the other machines on
your network see your web address... IE www.whatever.com but the machine
running the web server can only access the pages from the localhost?

most likely the lmhosts file is pointing to the wrong address:

for example: 192.168.1.6 is the same as www.whatever.com, but your webserver 
does not know the dns resolution. I think xitiami has this issue on their FAQ's

        I have an similar question? If you run a router, and your web =
server is running on a machine behind the router, why can only the other =
machines on your network see your web address... IE www.whatever.com but =
the machine running the web server can only access the pages from the =

        What is the IP address of the PC that is running Xitami?

        is your Xitami machine behind a firewall? if so, do you have =
port 80 mapped to the=20
        machine? even if Xitami is on the same machine as your firewall =
solution, you still=20
        need to create the port mapping.

[My web server]       [PC #2]                [PC #3]              [PC #4]

My web server can only access my web site like this
http://localhost/webpages/mypage

PC #2-4 can access it via http://www.mysite.com and
http://localmachinename/webpages/mypage

When my web server tries to access itself it times out. Someone once told me
that it has something to do with DNS resolution of itself
is impossible? anyone know of a fix for this or a work around?

most likely the lmhosts file is pointing to the wrong address:

for example: 192.168.1.6 is the same as www.whatever.com, but your webserver

does not know the dns resolution. I think xitiami has this issue on their
FAQ's

Are you on a router ?
How many IP addresses did you buy (or did they give you ?)

May I suggest you don't put the Xitami machine behind the router.
Point it to the gateway of the isp.
Your other machines, put these behind the router.
You really only need a router if you want a private ip network.

Message-ID: <F1141d4vJFRFWMozgYL00000c6d@hotmail.com>

~
Just thinking,,,
Xitami Web Server v2.5b5 dos-box in the tray and filter config to only allow 
127.0.0.01/admin  ..I do some text config in files too, occasionally.

lots of roaming ip bugs running up the size of access.log
/scripts../ ..etc    NNNNNNNNNNNN
ditto ditto ditto line after line.
Sure would be nice to eliminate all those whom http connect via myIP#

You've probably seen the above bug searchers too.

setup here;
Software Firewall =none, boy did it have lots of blocked numbers, and  keep

Router firewall = I can't see or think up anything geared for server inbound 
protection stopping IP# access - port:80 forwards to 80 or x,, Protection 
seems to be mostly `outbound parental or ip or name , word , mac , port , 
imcp/tcp/udp.  Bringing in to name.com:8989 or nonstandard:Port is extra 
upkeep 'elsewhere, no special ports at my.ods.org director.

Within Xitami, Can I simply deny the ip number somehow such that
domain.nameS.com or vHost.name have http access yet my ip number 4.64.xx.xIP 
does not have access or gets virtual'd to a no access & no log.

Anyhow, follow this hopefully;
Internet.IP / DSL /
4.64.xx.xIP:80-> dlink.Router-> 196.168.11.151:80
Xitami  http, not.ftp

196.168.11.151  index
Hostname.domain.org  index
vHost.domain.com    index2

Ideas? Thanks, mike

Hello !

To those still interested: there is an upgrade available for the log viewer.
Some users complained that there were screen problems under XP.
I don't use XP, so i can't debug them.
Downscrolling (scrolling in reverse order) could be the reason why there 
were screen problems, so this feature is removed.


Some tips if you have screen problems:

1
The application runs in the windows console subsystem: don't use a dosbox 
(cmd.com) to start the application, but start if from a GUI (windows 
explorer). Dos applications expects standard screens.

2
If you still have problems, set the cols and rows to standard values: 80 
and 25.



The upgrade uses an xilog.ini file where you can configurate the settings 
(run xilog without arguments for an help screen).

Executable: <http://web.verfaillie.com/webserver/xilog.exe>
Source:     <http://web.verfaillie;com/webserver/xilog.bas>

Subject: [Xitami] cgi form result
Message-ID: <oprlqg88k4mmleu4@localhost>

Okay. Another newbie query. I have the followinig simple html form 
attempting to post to a simple cgi result page, also shown below. The html 
form opens the cgi page in the browser but nothing is rendered and the 
Xitami icon in the Windows task tray times out.

Let me prface by declaring that I am running Xitami v2.4d9 straight out of 
the box, on a Windows98 system, with the original .cfg file. And, the two 
scripts below are textbook examples. All that is changed is the path to my 
Perl and that is ActiveState version 5.8.0.

All help will be greatly appreciated. I've been brickWalling this for a 
couple of weeks and confidence in Xitami, Perl and the whole cgi process is 
quickly waning.

thanks, Leon

Hi,

The mail server at iMatix which handles the Xitami mailing lists is
being upgraded today.  All the mailing lists are being copied over to a
new machine.

I don't expect any problems, but if anyone notices any issues with
sending messages to the mailing lists, etc, please let me know by email
(ewen@imatix.com).

This upgrade has now been completed.  (Assuming I see this message) I
believe everything is working, and all messages made it (except perhaps
one or two posts exactly at the point the mail was switched over).

As I said before, if anyone notices any problems please let me know

Would it not suffice to use one of the Windows' ports of the Unix tail
utility?  I regularly use an OS/2 port of tail, with the -f switch, to
view similar logs that all other programs refuse to open (because they're
supposedly locked).  I've not tried it with running Xitami logs, but see
no reason why it should not be equally efficaceous.  (For those
unfamiliar with the concept, "tail -f <filename>" will display the last
ten lines of a file, and then sit waiting for the file to be extended by
whatever is writing it, and display what gets added "in real-time", until
Ctrl-C is pressed.)

True, I've used tail of OS/2 on Xitami and it worked fine.

Works like a champ here under Windows 2000. I telnet into my servers and use 
it all the time. So far I haven't found a running log that I haven't been able 
to open yet.

Not quite: you (I think it was you) were advocating the use of the Unix
"less" utility, also with the "follow-on" flag.  However, I hadn't got
around to reading that contribution of yours when I wrote my reply: I was
about 300 non-spam mails behind on my various mailing lists, due to
illness last week.

You are quite correct. I backed up and read what I had posted.

Same basic response though, why re-invent the wheel? While OT it surprises me 
how many people overlook set and ready command line tools.

Indeed; I think it's to do with mindset.  Windows users are brain-washed
into believing that they need an "application program" to do any task.
Whereas those exposed to Unix realize that many tasks can be done by
stringing together the actions of a number of small tools.

The command-line side of things is, sadly, nowadays forgotten by a large
majority of computer users.  Click'n'drool is the way to go.

(And no, before anyone criticises my remarks as being those of a Unix
"fanatic", I don't use it: I use OS/2, and have for many years used Unix
tools ported to that environment.  Last time I really used Unix would

PDP-11. You're showing your age. Arent' those the ones where the 5mb hard drive is as big as a VW ... ?

Same one that had 256 K of memory ... for what ... 20 - 100 users ?

Isn't it nice that technology has advanced !

I don't have "tail" on my computer, and writing a small utility that can do 
the job is much easier to me than search for that program on the internet.
And i can modify my program to show the requests highlighted, and split the 
200-, 300-, 400-, and 500 (not that i have much of this last) responses in 
different colors.

(And no, before anyone criticises my remarks as being those of a Windows

applications ported to that environment. Last time i used Unix would have
been ca.1993....)

Hello,

By configuring the webmask in the Security section, we can limit the
set of clients that can connect to the http server.

But is it possible to do that only for certain part of the web site ?
As an example, any client can go to http://www.site.com, but we want to
restrict the access to http://www.site.com/private.

Windows? X'es? Matter of taste, requirements and ability I'd say.
But the strangest people on earth are those using OS/2 I think.
OS/2? Who? What? Very Strange.

AFAIK you can't do it with webmask, only with authentification 
(user/password combination).

Hi,
New to this, hope that someone can put my mind at rest.

Am getting lots of hits from codered and codered11 which are getting 404 replies.
Am also getting hits from Nimda, but some lines are getting a 200 reply.  Why? and is it a probem?

Checked out the archives before sending this, it was discussed in Sept 2001 but no real answer.

Am running v2.5b4 on win98 behind winroute (kerio) firewall.

Thanks. 
So lines containing % get a 404. Lines containing %% get a default page and so a 200.

You were right, it was discussed a few days ago. 
I did check the archives back to 2001, but didn't latch on to the header of that discussion: "server intrusion"

Greetings,

All those errors were really bugging me and since the server is only a P166,
I wanted them gone.  Solved it by changing the portbase variable in the
config file.  This moved my HTTP and FTP ports from non standards (80 and
21) to my own choosing (+portbase).  I haven't been scanned since.  The
firewall is getting hit a lot though...

My domain registrar (Stargate) supports URL forwarding, along with port
number.  So I forward to http://xx.my.ip.no:newport/valid_dir/index.htm and
it works.  Well, at least one domain does, anyway.  I've set up 5 more that
have yet to come online (this is day 3).

The next step is to register one domain with a DDNS service (probably
DynDNS.ORG) and see if I can forward to a port through that domain.

The only problem I have is getting the resident DOS FTP utility to access
the new FTP port.  IE gets in and I imagine any decent GUI does too.  Just
haven't spent the time researching it.

Much luck,
Charles

PS What is sad is that the IP's that scan me reverse to clients on ATTBI,
which means these are mostly corrupted personal machines.  Or have the IPs
been spoofed?

At the FTP command prompt, try 'OPEN hostname portnumber'. For example: open
ftp.sux.com 6021


Also, please remember to truncate/snip included quotes when necessary.

The only problem I have is getting the resident DOS FTP utility to access
the new FTP port.  IE gets in and I imagine any decent GUI does too.  Just

One of these worms prefers "local" IP numbers. The original used
random numbers, but that means vast amounts of around the world
traffic which got noticed quick. A later version prefers IP numbers
"near" itself, flooding a building which is less likely to attract
attention quickly. So most of your hits will be "nearby" IP numbers.

Also: most big servers were patched over a year ago when this worm
flooded the world. Today the most likely infection is a new machine
set up by someone who isn't aware of the issue: "Personal machines".

Anyone familiar with the Content Management System called Tiki? I am
attempting to run Tiki under the following conditions:

Xitami (latest version, win binary) on XP
mySQL (latest version, win binary)
PHP 4.2.3 (last version that had PEAR as part of the distro which is
required for Tiki)
Tiki 1.5

I have done the usual:

Loaded Xitami (no problems as usual :) )
Loaded mySQL (no problems as usual :) ) Added a user with full GRANT
privileges for Tiki use.
Loaded PHP4, no major hiccups, had to add a directory for SESSION_DATA
workspace as it was not added on installation.
Loaded Tiki.

After a little path editing everything seems to work well. A phpinfo() pops
back all the right stats.

The Tiki seems to load. However there is this annoying litle error reported
back by PHP --

         Notice: Undefined index QUERY_STRING in
......\Webpages\Tiki\tiki-setup.php in ln530

I went into Xitami to see if the QUERY_STRING in the CGI section was set. It
was not. flipped the bit but still get the error above. 

Xitami is working just fine. But I suspect that there is some other
configuration option I have overlooked!? If there are any Tiki developers
that know the solution, pass it on. 

TIA

Did you check in the php.ini if register globals was enabled? Check
the output of phpinfo() to see if it realy is. Was one of my problems,
too.

~~~~~~~~~~

I could wait but,,,an easy Xitami http server Question;
v2.5b5 / w98

Default Access.log cycles daily as shown below in
~~~ Xitami.cfg

Will this overiding vHost access.cfg ;
((cycle-day=1))
cycle daily, weekly, or monthly ?
~~~ vHost-access.cfg ~~~
[Accesslog]
    filename = "ods-access.log"
    cycle-day = "1"
    local = "0"
    cycle-arg = "ods-ac%yy%mm%dd.log"



~~~ Xitami.cfg ~~~
#   Specifies when to cycle the log file. When Xitami cycles a log
#   file, it first moves or copies the existing data to another file,
#   then creates a new, empty log file.

    cycle=daily


#   Specifies the day of the week or month that the log file is
#   cycled.

    cycle-day=0

~~~~~~~~~~~~~ guess i couldnt wait after all. `Thanks, Mike

As for "virtual domain" vs. "subdomain" -- example, I have one static IP
address that I host 10 domain names on, like www.abc.com, www.xyz.com etc.
Are you referring to "sub domain" as 123.abc.com, 456.abc.com, 789.abc.com
etc. with the abc.com being constant and the 123, 456, 789 being the sub
domain?
So hence I am referring to a virtual domain being a top level domain names
(such as abc.com, def.com etc.) That is my case, several different TLDs.
I want to be able to set up PHP in a virtual domain that is stated in the
defaults.cfg file as such --

[Virtual-Hosts]
    www.abc.com=abc.cfg
    www.def.com=def.cfg

Hope that makes sense.

Message-ID: <OF54361E95.A5F47A74-ONC1256CEF.004CC4F7@caisse-epargne.fr>

Hello with all
I am French (I use Altavista for the translation)

I use xitami with PHP on OS/2 and this does not go, explanations
Call of the page = http://126.99.218.150/refresh.php
The treatment is done, the refresh sends =
http://126.99.218.150/refresh.php?debut=1&fin=2
And, the refresh always sends the same thing =
http://126.99.218.150/refresh.php?debut=1&fin=2

<?
//-----------------------------
if ($debut==""){$debut=0;}else{$debut=$debut;}
if ($fin==""){$fin=1;}else{$fin=$fin;}
//-----------------------------
$debut_refresh = ($debut+1);
$fin_refresh = ($fin+1);

echo"<html>
    <head>
<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"2;URL=refresh.php?debut
=$debut_refresh&fin=$fin_refresh\">
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>";
?>

Do you have an explanation? This script functions on Apache with PHP on
Windows.

Try   print "$debut";

I bet you will find that it is always blank on one sever, and has a
value on the other server.

Your $debut is (or is not) imported from the URL Request. The user
can manually type a URL where $debut is any value. This could make a
script do something bad.

Older PHP imported the URL request anyway. Recent PHP does not
import the URL Request unless you ask for it. This can be changed by
the PHP administrator, or in each script.

Probably one of your servers has an older PHP, or the configuration
has been changed.

Read the PHP documentation for Register Globals:

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi all,

I'm trying to run a servlet in Xitami that I've tested in Tomcat. I got
the Sokrates package, installed it in its own directory under Xitami (is
it more proper to put into addons?), and set it up and got the demo
running with no problem. My OS is Win98 (for testing) and I'm using
Xitami Version 2.4d9.

Here are the questions:

1. What is analogous to the server.xml file in Tomcat? Is it runner.ini?

2. What is analogous to the web.xml that a webapp needs? MyServlet.ini?
If that is the case then I assume the props file for the servlet contains
all the keys and values that web.xml needs. Correct?

3. Lastly, I've got some servlet mapping tags that need to be taken care
of, such as:

<!-- URL mapping for the Files servlet -->
<servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>
                fileServlet
        </servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>
                /static/*
        </url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
Into which file would info like this go?
Thanks,
Bill Sherlock

Hello all,

First off, I'm very green to Xitami.

I just installed Windows XP Home Ed. to find that they no longer allow PWS
or IIS (Good thing, right?)  I installed Xitami, PHP, and MySQL and can
access my websites great from my PC.

When I try to access them externally, though, I always get the "this page
cannot be displayed" page.

What config am I missing to get this to work?

Thanks,
-=Rob=-

Who "they"? Your Internet Service Provider?
If your ISP don't allow webservers to be run on your account, _NO_ server 
will be allowed.
Generally, most ISP blocks ports below 1024 to prohibit residential users 
running servers on their local lines (and to prevent some nasty port scans 
-windows has lots of ports open to all sort of threats and unfriendly attacks)
.
You can change the port (try any port above 1024).
Change the config file "default.aut" to contain a line
[Server]
     Portbase=20720

(or any other value).
In this example, the http port will be shifted from 20720 + 80 to 20800

Access your page with http://mysite.com:20800

Look at http://web.verfaillie.be?webserver
(using redirect to a site whose access is "blocked" by the provider)

Not easy to analyse from your description. Maybe you changed your

I've been using Xitami to test some simple CGI programs.

One of these programs shows a real time log of a current process until the
user presses the STOP button.

This works OK on Apache but on XITAMI nothing is displayed - and then the
process times out.

I've searched around but can only find an old reference from the year 2000
that Xitami does not support NPH scripts.

Is this still the case - or are there plans to include this in future
releases?

Thanks.

OK
just go to your connection be it dialup or network Cable/DSL
right click on it then select properties then advance you should see the
Internet connection Firewall just uncheck it. It's just a basic firewall for
incoming only and does not check out going

make sure ZA is set to allow it also

Thanks for the tip!

I actually sniffed around last night and found that I don't have the WinXP
firewall enabled, so I decided to look around Zonealarm.  For some reason
(Maybe somebody playing with it here at the house) it was set to high
security!  Turned it down a notch and viola!  It works!

Thanks so much!

Hi all,

Trying to figure out this servlet stuff and how to get Xitami to run a
webapp. In Tomcat, all you need to do is to load your .war file into the
webapps directory. Is there anything analogous to this using Xitami and
Sokrates servlet runner? If so, is there any documentation for running
something a little more comples

Thanks,

Darg'h! I am trying a PHP/Xitami setup for the first time and it is not
immediately obvious to me at this point as to what directories that I should
place individuial php scripts into.
I have PHP4 setup wit Xitami (Windows) 2.54b.
Is there a global cfg or ini file somewhere that dictates where xitami and php
should look for a particular script?
I would assume that there is a way to keep different scripts in their own

Thanks for any assistance.

But the she-bang has to say what PROGRAM, not just what directory.
It needs to say "perl" or "perl.exe". Or maybe MyPearl.COM if you
have built your own script interpreter.

As Axel points out: on DOS/Windows: if you omit the directory or
specify a directory that does not exist, Xitami will attempt to find
the program by name along PATH, which is why "#! perl" will work.
Not all webservers will do this. I don't think Xitami will under
unix.

Also: Xitami often handles DOS-type back-slash directory syntax
correctly, but forward-slash works too and maybe more reliably.
Xitami will translate forward-slash syntax to back-slash on DOS
filesystems, but NT/XP systems actually take / just as well as \.

The most universal she-bang is "#! /usr/bin/perl"

This specifies the full path/program on most unix machines. On a
DOS/Win machine, be sure you do NOT have a /usr/bin/ folder (you
usually won't) and when Xitami fails there it will search along PATH
and find a "perl" to use.

If you must rely on PATH, be sure Perl Install sets it (or you set
it) and you may need to re-boot after Perl install so the PATH
statement is in effect when Xitami starts up.

Are you saying that you know for a fact that Xitami translated forward
slashes into backslashes under "DOS filesystems" (which presumably
includes Win9x/ME)?  Because I wonder why it bothers; DOS filesystem
internals have accepted forward slashes interchangably with backslashes
since DOS v1.0; it's only in a command-line that one has to use back-
slashes (because the forward slash has been stolen as the switch[1]
character to introduce command-line options).  Writing in Turbo-C and
VC++ under Win95, I have often used forward slashes in a path within an
fopen() call.

Not that it's particularly significant, but it does permit the programmer
to get away from the tyranny of the back-slash :-)

[1] Prior to DOS v4.01, one could use the SWITCHAR command (or poke a
character into the relevant memory location) to cause DOS to use '-'
instead of '/' for options (a  la Unix); with this change, one could then
use forward slashes in filepaths on the command line.

It most decidedly NOT a "backslash".  Back in the 1960s, when I too used
to use IBJOB control cards and the like, the character was generally just
called "slash".  Purists might call it "oblique" or "solidus".  NO ONE
EVER called it a "backslash" in that era.

A  novel etymology: would you like to air such ludicrous views in a place
densely populated with very erudite "old farts"; I mean, of course, the
newsgroup <news:alt.folklore.computers>.

That character was never seen until the second (or was it the third?)
revision of ANSI X3.64 (aka ASCII) in the mid-to-late-1960s.  As soon as
it appeared, some people started calling it a "backslash", because it was
the mirror image of the familiar "slash" character aforementioned.  Other
names are "reverse slash" or "reverse solidus".

I would agree with this viewpoint: however, I fail to see where the term

I didn't even know what a backslash was until I got my first computer in
198x something or other. We know things change thoughout the years and here
is what my friends who work for Microsoft say.

"\" is a backslash
"/" is a whack

So something like this http:// would be http:whackwhack and this c:\ would
be c:backslash

Thank you -- I like that definition best;-)

I always looked at it this way; this "/" is a forward slash simply because it
is one of these "|" that is falling FORWARD, you know, like we read left to
right. (english) So IMO in left to right, RIGHT is FORWARD. And of course
using this logic a "\" is a backslash because it is a "|" falling backwards.
heh.:-)

hacking, whacking and slashing with forward progress,

Subject: [Xitami] Virtual Hosts not using Logs
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20030328135248.02575bf0@mailserver.ewu.edu>

I am running the windows version of Xitami 2.4d9 under Win95 for student 
projects.  I have set up a number of virtual hosts, and gotten them working 
OK.   I have defined separate .cfg files for each,  and inside each .cfg I 
have defined access and error logs:

[Accesslog]
     Filename = "C:/Xitami/webpages/team01/logs/team01.log"
     enabled=1

[Errorlog]
     Filename = "C:/Xitami/webpages/team01/logs/team01Err.log"
     enabled=1

I have not defined either of those in defaults.cfg.

On startup, Xitami creates the specified .log files, in each team's 
directory, but then never seems to load anything into them -- all access 
and error information goes into the root logs.  I have RTFM'd the online 
documentation, visited a couple of websites, and trawled the 15MB xitami 
listserv file in my text file reader.  No enlightenment.

Any suggestions?

Will Xitami run on XP ?=20
Which instal version should I use ?

I have been running Xitami for some years currently 2.5b4 on my desktop =
(Windows 98) for testing cgi programs for use on my lawnbowls.com and =
other sites I am developing.
I want to set Xitami up similarly on my new laptop (Windows XP)

I note that the 'hosts' file on XP appears twice on XP (but in =
subdirectories not directly in the Windows directory)..

C:\WINDOWS\I386\HOSTS                           (there is also an =
encoded file LMHOST.SA_)
C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts      (there is also a file =
imhosts.sam)

I have set up my desktop Windows 98 computer so that I can toggle the =
content of 'c:\Windows\hosts' according to whether I am online or =
running Xitami offline.=20

-ie=20

If I am online it contains..
127.0.0.1 pop3.norton.antivirus  # Added by Norton AntiVirus for e-Mail =
scanning
127.0.0.1 pop3.spa.norton.antivirus  # Added by Norton AntiVirus for =
e-Mail scanning


If I am offline it contains..
127.0.0.1 pop3.norton.antivirus  # Added by Norton AntiVirus for e-Mail =
scanning
127.0.0.1 pop3.spa.norton.antivirus  # Added by Norton AntiVirus for =
e-Mail scanning
127.0.0.1 lawnbowls.com

(so http:\\lawnbowls.com runs on my computer rather than from the online =
site)

I want to duplicate this toggle system on the XP Laptop, but do not know =
which of these files need amending for the purpose.
Can you tell me which of the above files on the XP require amending ?

Thank you
Lesley
