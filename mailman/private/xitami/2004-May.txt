They apparently didn't actually try to build the newer versions of
Xitami before they slapped them on the web site.  You can get "c" (c.bat
on Windows I think) from 2.4d9 and it appears to work fine.

Use the Windows explorer instead of internet explorer.
Type the url in the address bar of windows explorer.
Works only for platform-II systems (w2k, wxp)
Left is your normal tree listing, right is your remote site file listing.

Internet explorer is only functional for downloads.

I don't see any way to get this version.

Do you have a URL?

Or is c.bat small enough to post here?

The simplest way to build Xitami under Windows is to use MSVC and build from 
the project files that you will find in xiopen/win32.

If you have access rights to the ftp site you can use internet explorer to
upload or download.

To make xitami 2.5c1 compile on Linux (downloaded from
http://www.xitami.com/xiopen_2_5_src.tar.gz)

I had to find the "c" file from a previous release (2.4d9), and put it
in every subdirectory, edit the "boomake" file in every subdirectory to
remove the COPTS= line (this caused problems on bash; not necessarily a
problem for everyone), then make the following change:

After this, xitami compiled for me, but wouldn't work with php.  I sent
mail to the list describing the php problem on Friday, 26 Mar 2004 but
got no reply, so I set xitami aside and started using lighttpd, which
isn't nearly as flexible as xitami but has the advantage that it serves
my dynamic pages.

I'd much rather use xitami, because I like the way it handles virtual
hosting, but I can't make it go and wasn't able to get any support, and
I just don't have time to sit and fiddle with it.

They apparently didn't actually try to build the newer versions of
Xitami before they slapped them on the web site.  You can get "c" (c.bat
on Windows I think) from 2.4d9 and it appears to work fine.

I upgraded myself from 2.4d9 to 2.5c1. It was a fresh install, and then
I just moved my CGI-bin and webpages folders over.

For configuration I went into the web based configuration, and set up
things the way I had it before in 2.4d9.

What I noticed was that when I saved the settings, not everything saved.
Things like turning off the FTP server would not save, and I had to
manually put them in the default.aut file to hold the configuration. 

Have you guys found the same? Any work around so that it will actually
save all the settings?

Otherwise the upgrade went fine.

I found an old c.cmd for OS/2 but when using that I get:-

[C:\ux2bs\workdir\xiopen]sh boomake build
Building application...
Compiling -g.c...
Incorrect function
Compiling -g.c...
Incorrect function
Compiling -g.c...
Incorrect function
Compiling -g.c...
Incorrect function
Compiling -g.c...
Incorrect function
Compiling -g.c...
Incorrect function

A file called -g.lst containing:- 

gcc: No input files


also gets created so I suspect parameters are not getting passed properly 
or something else is missing.

Do I need something called c.conf? If so where do I find an example of 
that?

:(  We don't have OS/2 to test on.  Further, the Boom scripts assume a certain 
syntax for the c shell which the old c.cmd does not handle correctly.

You should be able to build from the source file simply by doing this (and I'm 
testing it as I write):

 - unpack the source archive and cd into xiopen
 - copy the contents of sfl, gsl, smt, xiadmin, and studio into xiopen
 - remove lrstudio.c and smtschm.c, which are unfortunately-named Libero 
schemas
 - compile all the C programs: c *.c
 - place all objects into a library: c -r liball *.o
 - link Xitami: c -l xitami

This will work with the OS/2 c.cmd file and should also work from the Win32 
command line.

I don't see any of these - I'm using 2.4d10 if that makes any 
difference...

Don't see those either.

Do I need a c.conf? I don't have one, but it is mentioned in c.conf.

2.4d10 is a simpler product, it has three sub-projects: sfl, smt, and xiopen.

So unpack the source package, copy the contents of the sfl and smt 
subdirectories into xiopen and compile and link.  I don't recall whether OS/2 
allows wildcards like 'c *.c'.

> Do I need a c.conf? I don't have one, but it is mentioned in c.conf.

No, you don't need this.

What should I use instead?

I was referring to a source code package.

As I said previously running 'c *.c' results in the system being unable to 
find the file specified.

Yes, it does.

Where would I find one anyway? It may be somewhere that I set a number of

I'll also note that if you want to add compiler flags you can edit the
"c" file in each directory and put them in the "CCOPTS" field ... it
seems to work OK there.

I have v2.5c1 now. There is only a boomake in the top level directory. 
When I use it I get:-

It seems as though the headers are missing.

I'm obviously using the wrong file. Can you give me a URL for the archive 
you think works?

If you have unpacked the source archive correctly you should find yourself 
with a top level directory containing a few files, and several subdirectories 
containing the different projects that Xitami is built from.

If you don't find these subdirectories, you may have extracted a binary 
package instead.  Or, your source archive may be corrupted.  This is the 
start of the listing of the xiopen_2_4_src.tar.gz file, for instance:

$ tar -ztf xiopen_2_4_src.tar.gz
build.bat
build.sh
sfl/version.h
sfl/prelude.h
sfl/sflhead.h
sfl/sflbits.c
sfl/sflcomp.c
...

Ugh!  [Spit, spit]

Are you really able to keep a cross-platform source that compiles through
that heap of shit?  If so, I take off my hat to you.

Or have you got configuration control problems, and multiple forking of
sources?

Take a look, if you care.  Xitami consists of a core engine that is totally 
portable.  This engine is wrapped in several command-line envelopes that 
include more or less functionality (e.g. xilite which is minimalistic).

There is also a Windows GUI that provides a simple front-end for the web 
server engine.  This code is not portable.

We don't have code forks and we don't have many configuration problems, but 
there is a price to pay nonetheless - the source code is split into different 
layers (such as SFL for all portability, SMT for the multithreading engine) 
and the build process has to work with these.  It is not trivial to build 
Xitami from scratch.

Incidentally, we make other products, and it's always quite complex to build 
them.  We developed Boom (a configuration management tool) because the manual 
packaging process for Xitami was too delicate and broke too often.  So while 
the current source packages are difficult to build, they are accurate and 
complete.

Xitami's architecture dates from 1996 when we started designing portable 
servers, and it's still a good architecture.  Apache/2.0 uses the same 3-tier 
model (since 1999, three years after us), with a portability library, a 
network service framework, and server protocol handlers.

I got the source tarball from xitami.com; it includes a boomake file in
each subdirectory:
xiopen/boomake
gsl/boomake
smt/boomake
studio/boomake
xiadmin/boomake
sfl/boomake

... then in the top level directory there are those 6 directories plus a
build.sh and a build.bat.  Running build.sh just enters each
subdirectory and runs "sh boomake build install."



I've found some notes that I wrote down when building xitami 2.5c1;
here's the process I used:

1) get "c" from xitami-2.4d9 and put a copy in each subdirectory
2) in each subdirectory, edit boomake and remove "-g" from the COPTS
line
3) Apply patch [posted a couple of days ago]
4) add "#include <math.h>" to gsl/ggeval.c and gsl/ggstrn.c or gcc fails
on the floor() function
5) cd <path>/sfl
   CCNAME=gcc CCPRODLEVEL=production CCOPTS="<CFLAGS>" sh boomake build
	install
6) cd ../gsl
   CCNAME=gcc CCPRODLEVEL=production CCOPTS="<CFLAGS>
	-I<installpath>/include -L<installpath>/lib -lm" sh boomake build
	install
7) cd ../smt
   <repeat>
	cd ../studio
	<repeat>
	cd ../xiadmin
	<repeat>
	cd ../xiopen
	<repeat>

If there were errors in steps 5, 6, or 7, add
CCLIBS="<installpath>/lib/libgsl.a \
   <installpath>/lib/libsfl.a \
   <installpath>/lib/libxac.a \
   <installpath>/lib/libstu.a \
   <installpath>/lib/libsmt.a"
to your big command line (CCNAME, CCPRODLEVEL, CCOPTS, etc) and try again.



... of course it's worth noting that the resulting server served static
pages but wouldn't serve php.  Don't know if that's related or not.

OK Marc and corwin,


Thanks for the Replies :) :)

The systems in question are W95 and W98 and no ADDRESS bar seeems to be available for Windows Explorer. At least I cannot find one plus, as mentioned ---- ",,,only for W2K and WXP,,,".

And, the Forwarding of port 21 on the ROUTER to the Xitami machine gave some added ability.

DRAG/DROP after the connection is made:

      When ftp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@URL is entered in the 
      Internet Explorer ADDRESS pane and the connection is 
      made I can poke on the file in the Internet Explorer Browser 
      Window and drag it to the desk top or any other folder. However, 
      this creates only a SHORTCUT to that file at the Xitami FTP Server.

FTP commands to the Internet Explorer ADDRESS pane:

      Please forgive my loss of memory, but after the connection is 
      made I am not succesfull in entering the correct ftp command 
      syntax to the Internet Explorer ADDRESS pane to PUT, GET, etc. to 
      the Xitami FTP Server. EXAMPLE:     ftp://put c:\folder\filename.ext@URL

      However, using ftp from the DOS command language environment 
      works, but in this situation ftp on the client is connecting 
      to ftp at the server and the client side stays up and running.

For the Internet Explorer it could be the client side is missing something?????
Or, maybe it's the ACCESS RIGHTS thing but there are no passwords set to the shared folder on the Xitami FTP SERVER machine, and the * is set in the Xitami FTP username area to allow all Xitami FTP commands.

For the Internet Explorer ADDRESS pane, no luck to find the proper command string for Xitami FTP PUT, GET, etc. in the Xitami documents. Also, used the FAQ and the Email forum history and cannot find anything related. Maybe I am not using the correct keywords.

THANKS for your help, time, and advise!!!!! :) :)

Subject: [Xitami] Use of Xitami FTP in a Browser.
Message-ID: <05E6E205332C2D45A13964D8BCBE022C30A14B@cu-exsrv1.cu.net>

First get new systems :P

But with IE on a NT kernal acts different than on a 9x machine.  I would
recommned using a program like wsftp for file transfers to the server
from any machine(NT based or 9x based).  The copy paste works but much
harder to get around with than a good ftp client software.  And if you
are using a lot of files IE can really mess up your day.=20

OK Marc and corwin,


Thanks for the Replies :) :)

The systems in question are W95 and W98 and no ADDRESS bar seeems to be
available for Windows Explorer. At least I cannot find one plus, as
mentioned ---- ",,,only for W2K and WXP,,,".

And, the Forwarding of port 21 on the ROUTER to the Xitami machine gave
some added ability.

DRAG/DROP after the connection is made:

      When ftp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@URL is entered in the=20
      Internet Explorer ADDRESS pane and the connection is=20
      made I can poke on the file in the Internet Explorer Browser=20
      Window and drag it to the desk top or any other folder. However,=20
      this creates only a SHORTCUT to that file at the Xitami FTP
Server.

FTP commands to the Internet Explorer ADDRESS pane:

      Please forgive my loss of memory, but after the connection is=20
      made I am not succesfull in entering the correct ftp command=20
      syntax to the Internet Explorer ADDRESS pane to PUT, GET, etc. to=20
      the Xitami FTP Server. EXAMPLE:     ftp://put
c:\folder\filename.ext@URL

      However, using ftp from the DOS command language environment=20
      works, but in this situation ftp on the client is connecting=20
      to ftp at the server and the client side stays up and running.

For the Internet Explorer it could be the client side is missing
something?????
Or, maybe it's the ACCESS RIGHTS thing but there are no passwords set to
the shared folder on the Xitami FTP SERVER machine, and the * is set in
the Xitami FTP username area to allow all Xitami FTP commands.

For the Internet Explorer ADDRESS pane, no luck to find the proper
command string for Xitami FTP PUT, GET, etc. in the Xitami documents.
Also, used the FAQ and the Email forum history and cannot find anything
related. Maybe I am not using the correct keywords.

THANKS for your help, time, and advise!!!!! :) :)

If you are looking for a wsftp client, I'm using core ftp light. It works great for me here, it's easy to 
configure; and I'm just starting out with webserver and ftp. It's not a "pro" version but FREE. I'm at work 
here and don't have the url, so I will throw it in tomorrow,

Hello,

There use to be a mailing list forum archive that could be searched. The last URL I had for this was at:

              http://xitami.ec-computers.net/

Today, a few hours ago, it was not available. It was tried several times and still no go.

Is it still available and if so, what is the URL?


THANKS!!!

Jerry

OK Johannes,

THANKS for the HELP,,,,,,

Looks like I am missing an FTP client type software application to be able to do this from the Internet Explorer Browser(???).

The LAN contains some older W95/W98 systems. And, some have been loaded with the Xitami Server. They are surprisingly responsive and work to great satisfaction. Not much access, but the access is necessary.

All we want to do is tell someone how to use FTP (syntax example of an FTP PUT, etc.) in a WEB Browser ADDRESS pane (Internet Explorer for example) to the Xitami FTP Server from somewhere on the Internet outside this LAN.

It is simple to use the MSDOS Command line FTP to these XITAMI servers, but if possible we would like to avoid using the MSDOS environment.

THANKS for your help, advise, and time!!! :) :)

Jerry

Hello,

There use to be a mailing list forum archive that could be searched. The
last URL I had for this was at:

              http://xitami.ec-computers.net/

Today, a few hours ago, it was not available. It was tried several times and
still no go.

Is it still available and if so, what is the URL?


THANKS!!!

Jerry

In each subdirectory, edit the boomake file and where it says "COPTS=-g"
remove the "-g" so it just says "COPTS=" ... this also happened on my
system (bash).

On a somewhat unrelated note, the build.sh script is 144 lines (as
opposed to build.bat which is less than 20) and it appears to build
everything over and over again, including features that aren't included
with the free version.  Is there a reason to build everything seven
times?

I was referring to a source code package.

As I said previously running 'c *.c' results in the system being unable to 
find the file specified.

Yes, it does.

Where would I find one anyway? It may be somewhere that I set a number of

Hello Brian,

THANKS for the link!!!!!

And, I was hoping there was SEARCH criteria which was available on the link mentioned below:
below:
           http://xitami.ec-computers.net/

At least I think there was SEARCH criteria at this link, but I have not used it in a long period and it seems not available at this time.

Looking at this link, it appears it belongs to someone who created a SEARCHABLE page for the ARCHIVES but no longer exists (maybe ec-computers?????).

THANKS,

Jerry

OK Johannes,

THANKS for the HELP,,,,,,

Looks like I am missing an FTP client type software application to be
able to do this from the Internet Explorer Browser(???).

The LAN contains some older W95/W98 systems. And, some have been loaded
with the Xitami Server. They are surprisingly responsive and work to
great satisfaction. Not much access, but the access is necessary.

All we want to do is tell someone how to use FTP (syntax example of an
FTP PUT, etc.) in a WEB Browser ADDRESS pane (Internet Explorer for
example) to the Xitami FTP Server from somewhere on the Internet outside
this LAN.

It is simple to use the MSDOS Command line FTP to these XITAMI servers,
but if possible we would like to avoid using the MSDOS environment.

THANKS for your help, advise, and time!!! :) :)

Jerry

No it doesn't; OS/2 expands wildcards within each application, not within
the shell.  So the parameter "*.c" would be passed over intact to the
c.cmd (is this a batch file, or is it a proper REXX command procedure?)
and this in turn (presumably) will pass it on to gcc --- which doesn't
know how to expand "*.c".

[If c.cmd *is* written in REXX, rather than just a series of OS/2
commands, then it would be easy to rewrite so as to expand *.c]

I still can't get over the concept that a file might be required, is
mentioned in a particular file, but that file doesn't exist!  I presume
one of the instances of "c.conf" in that line quoted above is actually
something else?

Why on earth are you persisting in trying to use Internet Explorer, which
is a BROWSER and hence intended for looking AT information, in the
entirely unsuitable role of a general-purpose FTP client?  IE is ONLY
able to be an FTP client for the purposes of GETting files; it is useless
for the purposes of any other action, such as PUTting a file, or renaming
files on the server.  Come to that, the whole scheme of URIs (or URLs,
for those that fail to keep up with standards) has no provision for
specifying any form of FTP transfer apart from a GET operation (except
for performing a LIST, to get a directory listing; this can be done by
ensuring that the trailing solidus is present after the directory name).

You either need a dedicated FTP client with a GUI, or more competent
[human] clients that can use a CLUI FTP client, such as FTP.EXE that
comes as part of all versions of Windows.

[Whilst you're at it, consider trimming needlessly quoted material; there
were 183 lines of old posts following yours, almost completely
irrelevant.]

The file didn't appear to be required to the point that the build didn't
go without it, and since there doesn't seem to be any documentation
anywhere on it I just ignored that part.  The documentation on
xitami.com seems to refer to the 2.4d9 style of build system (using
xibuild) so you just have to infer from the source what to do ... it
seemed from the source that the conf file isn't required, and that those
settings could be changed directly in the "c" file.  My guess was that
it was something that the developers used for compiling under different
platforms without changing the package.

Why on earth are you persisting in trying to use Internet Explorer, which

entirely unsuitable role of a general-purpose FTP client?  IE is ONLY
able to be an FTP client for the purposes of GETting files; it is useless

While I'm not particular thrilled with IE as an FTP client, it -- v6 -- does
in fact have the capability to Get, Put, Rename, Delete, Create Folders,
Delete Folders.

It works pretty much like a Windows Explorer window after connecting
to an FTP site.

Some users who can't quite grasp the workings of an FTP client do just
fine with IE6... Sometimes you have to go with what works.

Hello Bruce and Jeff :) :)

Bruce,,,,,that did the trick,,,,thanks for the link!

Jeff,,,,THANKS for your comments and I agree! :)

The end users have no problems with either an FTP Client or Server or the FTP CLIENT under MSDOS or any other FTP application for either client or server. We are trying to catch up with stuff we used over 25 years ago. It appears after many years all this Internet stuff seems to have evolved the way a lot of folks predicted at that time,,,even before ARPANET was the term for the day.

It's a matter of what the right and left hand,,, I mean click know what to do rather than a Browser ADDRESS pane entry.

Again,,,,Bruce,,,that link corrected our misgivings about any Browser Address pane keyin and provided the information so we know the difference between the right and left hand,,,,I mean click!!!! :) :)


THANKS!!!! :) :) :)

Jerry

I have upgraded my servers over the past month, some sites are not back online yet. I will try to get the old Xitami list
archive back online soon.

Subject: [Xitami] GET / POST
Message-ID: <3934.84.66.90.94.1083794769.squirrel@mail.pobox.co.uk>

Just a quick question - I'm running Xitami 2.4d10 on Windows XP Pro
running PHP5.0.0RC1 with GD2.0.23 compatible release (within PHP5) and
FreeType 2.x.

PHP, GD and FreeType all seem to work fine - I can generate images and so
on and gd_info works.

The problem is that Xitami doesnt appear to be passing the GET / POST info
to PHP, or that PHP might be ignoring it (possibly configuration on either
of them?).

I've tested an identical script on one of my websites and it works fine
(var dumping the get/post arrays), but I cant see anything I'm doing
wrong. If this is likely to be a PHP problem then I'll check out their
website or whatever, but I was thinking it might be an Xitami
configuration prob coz I've got it working before (when Xitami was
released with an installer!)

Thanks for any help all

The old Xitami List Archives are back online at http://xitami.ec-computers.net
along with the search function. The downloadable archives are offline at this time
as I lost the zip files when transfering everything over to the new servers. I will work
on getting them back online in the near future.

I am running Xitami 2.5 and have a problem.....and I wonder if someone can
enlighten me.  I host 5 domains yet when I loaded the files and went through
the setup process I get well.....

Thank you for replying.  My line reads:

Actually no, I didn't..  I turned on the bad apache file to keep the sites
up until I can figure out xitami out.  :(

Hi Michael,

Thank you so much for getting back to me.  I am impressed with how helpful
people have been here.  I abandoned apache because of the lack of support.
My husband vanished one day and left me with five sites to host and I had no
idea how to manage apache.  Xitami seems easier visually, so I embrace it!

Here is the issue:

http://www.boatsafe.ca/

Rather then get the whole site, I get a list of the sites that I do host.
Nothing goes directly where it ought to be.....

Jill

Hi Jill, I'm sorry I called you Jim!  :-)

I just got back from a weekend away, and so I didn't get to see your site
when it wasn't working properly.  Can you describe what was happening, or
re-create it so I can take a look?

Hi Jill,

It looks like each site is "working," as long as you go into the directory 
for each site.  What you need to do is tell Xitami, "hey, if someone gets 
here by using www.boatsafe.ca, then send them to this folder.  If they get 
here using www.twochickies.ca, then send them to this folder," etc.

That's easy to do.  What you will do is create a text file called 
"defaults.cfg" in your Xitami folder, and you will create a .cfg file for 
each of your hosts.

When Xitami starts, it loads a configuration file called Xitami.cfg.  You 
might want to take a look at it sometime, it is very self-explanitory.  
After Xitami loads this file, it looks for a file called defaults.cfg, and 
if it exists, it will "override" any setting in xitami.cfg with what's in 
defaults.cfg.  This is a good thing, because you probably shouldn't ever 
change xitami.cfg.  If you need to make changes to Xitami's configuration, 
it's a good idea to put them in defaults.cfg.

So.....In your "defaults.cfg" file, put the following:


[Virtual Hosts]
   www.boatsafe.ca = "boatsafe.cfg"


You're telling Xitami that you host a site called www.boatsafe.ca, and the 
instructions for delivering that page can be found in the file called 
boatsafe.cfg.  Of course, you can make that filename anything you want, 
but it's a good idea to give it a name that makes sense.  :-)

So now, when someone visits your site via www.boatsafe.ca, Xitami will 
know that it needs to refer to boatsafe.cfg to get instructions on how to 
deliver that page.  That means we need a boatsafe.cfg!

Create a file called "boatsafe.cfg" in your Xitami folder.  In that file, 
put the following:

[Server]
   webpages = "./boatsafe"

Here, you're telling Xitami that the files for your boatsafe pages can be 
found in a particular location.  I'm assuming that your web page directory 
is "under" your Xitami directory.  If not, just put the complete path to 
your boatsafe pages there.

That should do it for boatsafe.  If you would like to "point" your other 
sites, just add lines to the default.cfg file, and create the appropriate 
.cfg files that point to the appropriate directories.  For example, if you 
were hosting twochickies too, your defaults.cfg would look something like:

[Virtual Hosts]
   www.boatsafe.ca = "boatsafe.cfg"
   www.twochickies.ca = "twochickies.cfg"

and you would create twochickies.cfg to look like this:

[Server]
   webpages = "./twochickies"

That's all there is to it!  There is a lot of information that you can put 
in these .cfg files to make Xitami act different ways when folks visit 
different sites for you.  Keep working at it!  Xitami is a GREAT server, 
it kicks Apache's butt.  :-)

Oh, one more thing:  In your defaults.cfg file, you REALLY should add:

[Security]
   dirlist = "0"

That way, no one will be able to get the directory list that Xitami is 
delivering now, even if you DON'T have default pages.  Never a good idea 
to deliver a directory listing of your computer.

Good luck!  If you need any more help, just ask.  :-)

Hi Jill,

It looks like each site is "working," as long as you go into the directory
for each site.  What you need to do is tell Xitami, "hey, if someone gets
here by using www.boatsafe.ca, then send them to this folder.  If they get
here using www.twochickies.ca, then send them to this folder," etc.

That's easy to do.  What you will do is create a text file called
"defaults.cfg" in your Xitami folder, and you will create a .cfg file for
each of your hosts.

When Xitami starts, it loads a configuration file called Xitami.cfg.  You
might want to take a look at it sometime, it is very self-explanitory.
After Xitami loads this file, it looks for a file called defaults.cfg, and
if it exists, it will "override" any setting in xitami.cfg with what's in
defaults.cfg.  This is a good thing, because you probably shouldn't ever
change xitami.cfg.  If you need to make changes to Xitami's configuration,

Hello,  :) :)

And, thanks for your time, advise, and HELP!!!

In a previous discusion about the Xitami FTP Server it was mentioned that I should also forward the ROUTER port 20 to the Xitami FTP Server IP.

I can find PORT 21 described in the Xitami Document for FTP, but Port 20 cannot be found.

The following was listed at IANA for ports 20 and 21;

      ftp-data         20/tcp    File Transfer [Default Data]
      ftp-data         20/udp    File Transfer [Default Data]
      ftp              21/tcp    File Transfer [Control]
      ftp              21/udp    File Transfer [Control]

Please forgive me, the last time I worked with any level of protocol was a long time ago (circa "IBM BI-SYNC" and previous).

It does look like port 21 is to logon with username:password control (authentication???) and that 20 would be the up/down load of files(???).


        1. Is this the meaning for port 20 and 21? 
        2. If so and port 20 is used by Xitami should it 
           be discussed in the documentation?

Thanks for your help!

What are you inputting to see the latter?  According to DNS,
www.chrisjonessr.com is [216.168.224.70].

[fx: clatter,clatter]

Hmm; it seems that you're using some sort of redirection --- when I typed
the "alphabetic" URL into Netscape, I got to http://24.88.50.145/ too.
Are you using some sort of dynamic DNS redirection service?

Further investigation (with a CLI telnet client, with logging, connecting
to port 80 of www.chrisjonessr.com), with the following commands:

    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.chrisjonessr.com
    
elicits the response:

    HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
    Server: Netscape-Enterprise/6.0

    Content-length: 0
    Content-type: text/html
    Location: http://24.88.50.145
    Connection: close
    
I suggest you contact whomsoever is managing the server at
[216.168.224.70] and ask them if there is a more opaque option available
for the redirection.   (I note that [24.88.50.145] would seem to be a
RoadRunner cable connection; can you get fixed IP service for this?)

Yes: port 21 is used for control connections (of course, the originating
FTP client can use anything it likes).  Port 20 is used, by an FTP
server, for uploaded [i.e. PUT] data; in the full protocol, downloaded
[i.e. GET] data is sent TO whichever port the client has negotiated with
a PORT command, from port 20 on the server.

Why should it?  Port 20/21 is part and parcel of FTP, which was
standardized in RFC-765 way back in June of 1980.

It's only things like firewalls and NATted routers which cause difficulty
with this standard, and it is in that area that further documentation
ought to be expected.

RFC-765 includes a rather useful bit of "ASCII Art":

                                            -------------
                                            |/---------\|

I so appreciate it.  I recall my husband had begun with Xitami initially but
went to apache for some reason - I never knew why.  When I was left with it
though, it looked Greek to me.  I tried to get help and was told to buy the
book!  It's awful, because although I am no expert, the sites shouldn't fold
because of my lack of knowledge.

So far, things seem to be going well and I am so grateful.  Thank you so

Good luck with your pages, and if you need any more help, please don't

OK and I apologize that I did not mention that a ROUTER with the NAT firewall is involved.
And, you answered that issue below.

Yep,,,,,,EXACTLY!

So, for those that are not completely up-to date with respect to these issues, etc. it would have been helpful if this had been discussed in the documentation along side the description of Port 21. As a result, it took some time away from others who very graciously responded to and helped solve this issue of Xitami FTP Server related to a ROUTER.

Jerry

Hello...

I would like to ask this question again if there are any takers.

I was using Xitami for a year in an earlier version, can't remember =
which.  I had the long form of the logs set (CLFX).  It was working fine =
for many months.  All of a sudden it would only dish out the short form. =
 After a while, I upgraded Xitami to 2.5 c1.  From the start it only =
gives out the short form of the logs.  I don't understand what's going =
on.  Does anyone know what may have happened and how to get the long =
form working again?

Thank you...

Actually, I meant that the documentation of routers and firewalls ought
to explain these minutiae, which would be common to any FTP server.  I
don't believe that Xitami's documentation need concern itself with
concepts that lie outside of itself, and are a generic problem (although
it could, and perhaps should, say "if you're behind a router that does
NAT, or a firewall, you'll need to read that product's documentation to
understand how to open up the ports that Xitami might use").

Subject: [Xitami] SSL on xitami Pro
Message-ID: <KJEFJKBAIEKKBHAACJIGCEBIDAAA.dave@advancedzzz.com>

I have been a long time Xitami user, but now however I am at a impasse.
Perhaps I am overlooking something.
Here is my problem.
I have purchased Xitami Pro and installed it as per the instructions.
I have generated my private key and created a Temporary Untrusted
Certificate.
So far so Good.
When I type the address in as follows https://mysite.com the security works
and the little lock icon lights up showing that I am using a secure
connection.
HOWEVER
If I type http://mysite.com it still displays my wbsite in a non secure
connection.
How do I prevent this behavior?
How do I force secure connections only?
Thanks for answering.

You should be running your server behind a firewalll/router for security.  In 
that case, you can block off or redirect port 80, and keep port 443 (https) 
open for SSL connections.

   Might not at least a workaround be to change the default port 80 to
   an obscure port in the configuration if a firewall was not readily
   available??

An easy way would be to get your server script to find out if it is =
using a secure connection, and if not, to feed your browser a simple =
page telling it to load the secure one instead.

An example of how to do this using perl is as follows:

Insert the following line into your script, somewhere before the script =
sends any info to the browser.
Immediately after any 'use' or require' statements is a good place.

If your secure port is not 443, change the number below.
#
if ($ENV{'SERVER_PORT'} ne '443') { &redirectsecure; }
#

now insert the following procedure into the script, changing =
www.mysite.com to your own address (e.g. =
https://www.thesite.com/cgi-bin/page.pl
#
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "This is the secure page";
sub redirectsecure {
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print <<"EOF";

Subject: [Xitami] only localhost access for xitami - help
Message-ID: <40A9762D.2000009@verizon.net>

I am using xitami as a testbed for cgi.
It's on my pc. But my pc has dsl. I want to block
any outside access to xitami server, as I said it's
on my pc and I only want to allow access to it from
THAT (my) pc.

Is this a valid concern since I am networked to
the internet via my dsl?

If so what's the best way to do what I want?

note: I have a linksys router between my dsl modem
and pc - I think it has simple firewall capabilities, if
that's any help.

Thanks

In your Xitami.cfg file, you will find the following:

[Security]
   webmask=

Add your IP address to this (I suggest 127.0.0.1 instead of your external 
IP, just in case your ISP gives you a new one down the road).  Once you 
add an IP to this list, all other IPs will be blocked.

NOTE:  I would actually create a file called defaults.cfg in your Xitami 
directory, and add these two lines to that file.  I try to never change 
Xitami.cfg.  Whatever is in defaults.cfg will be loaded after your 
Xitami.cfg file, and therefore the settings in defaults.cfg will replace 
those in Xitami.cfg.

Don't worry about copying everything from Xitami.cfg over to defaults.  
Only the things that actually appear in defaults will override.  If it's 
not in defaults, Xitami will keep the Xitami.cfg values.  (Did that make 
sense??)

Let me know if you need more details.

Michael

Yes, it is a legitimate concern if you don't want others to see what is on
your server.  But, you also said you have a router between your computer and
DSL modem, which means you have an unresolvable IP address that cannot be
accessed unsolicited by just anyone on the internet as long as you have not
setup a NAT to that computer (Don't worry, if you didn't do it, it isn't
setup).  So, you should be just fine.  If you are really concerned, turn on
your firewall in your router (not a bad idea to have it on anyway), and to
be REALLY safe, block incoming ports 80 and 21, then you should definately
be safe.

But, if there are any other computers connected to your router (on the same
subnet), they will be able access the server on that machine.  I wouldn't be
sure how to stop this other than activating a firewall on the PC that is
running on the server.  And at that point, I am not sure localhost will
work.  Probably will, though.

Good luck,

- Jay

I'm running Xitami on Mandrake Linux computers on AMD 466MHz.  And they do
just fine.  And you can get a computer like that new for less than $100 in
the US today if try hard at all.  It can't be THAT much worse overseas.  One
of the great things about Xitami, as I am sure you know, is that it runs
with such a little footprint compared to most servers, making it very fast
in comparision.

And rather than throwing out the "broken" computers, try and find out what
is broken on them.  Most of the time its only one component like the RAM,
MB, Processor, HD, or PSU.  And on a Xitami capable machine that has been
around for a couple of years, you should be able to replace whatever it is
for less than $50.  Even if you have never broken open a case before, its
not that hard at all.  And anyway, what do have to lose?  How to replace it
is in the manual.

All of my machines (except my laptops) are built from scratch.  I do this
because it is soo much more affordable to keep them up.  I stay at
pricepoint.  Any one component over $50 I don't usually bother with -
depended on the machine's duty in life.  Man, you can get an Athelon XP 2200
for $51.15 including shipping in the US - Or an athelon 700 Mhz Slot A for
$15 (with free shipping).  If you don't like AMD, go with a Pentium III 1.13
GHz for $48, or a Celeron 800 for $17.  I found this stuff while writing
this on www.pricewatch.com in less than a minute.  You can even get a 100GB
hard drive for $58 before shipping, or a 25Gig for $25.  You name it,
Motherboards, RAM, etc - stuff that was top-of-the-line a couple of years
ago is CHEAP.

None of my computers EVER die, they just get upgraded when something goes
wrong, I just replace it for like $50.  Motherboards too.  I still have 2.1
Gig HDs running that I bought for $4 each when they were worth like $300
each 10 years ago.  IDE Controllers are cheap.

Hi all,
 
I want to make Xitami "anonymous" to illegal requests. One very importing is
to suppress some HTTP headers, in particular "Server".
 
As I understood right, it's enough to place a file header.<extension> in
"header-dir". I tried it with "header.php" for PHP-Scripts. This file
contains only one row
Server: Unknown
 
If I now retrieve a PHP script from my client, the HTTP-header "Server" is
already transmitted with the value "Xitami".
 
Does anybody have experience with HTTP headers and first of all an idea how
to solve this problem?

Hi Thomas

I don't know much about headers at all....but I know that the GSL 
scripting language that is supported by Xitami has a few "default" 
scripts, and one is the default "error" script.  It appears to be a file 
that formats the error messages that are returned by Xitami.  I took a 
look at that script, and I see information regarding the server type and 
version.

Don't know if changing that will help you, but the file is called 
xitami/templates/errors.gsl.  A bit more information about it can be found 
in xitami.cfg.

Michael

Hi,

I'm wondering what the limitations are with Xitami.
Specifically with the perl module HTML::Mason.
http://www.masonbook.com/
This seems really great and I think will replace
the "normal" perl CGI. Is there anyway now or in the
futrue that Xitami could support this?

Thanks,
Lee G.

Hello  :) :)


THANKS for your time, help, and advise.

Started using the FTP portion of Xitami a few weeks ago and all is working great.

After reading the Xitami document and in the FTP portion it appears that the use of Xitami FTP
there is no method to establish SECURITY other than the noted USERNAME and PASSWORD at the Xitami FTP SERVER. The normal use of the DOS Command Line FTP and the use of FTP in the browser to copy also has no security other than the Username and Password prompt.

The following 2 questions are related to any security method with the Xitami (v2.5b4) FTP Server of the data transmitted for USERNAME, PASSWORD, and File Data. 


   1. Is there a method to secure the actual data being transmitted using the Xitami Server?

      I have found other providers of FTP CLIENT/SERVER processes that provide this 
      protection. I am just curious if this can be done using Xitami.

   2. Does the PRO version of Xitami cover this?


Thanks, :) :)

Jerry

Message-ID: <opr79qycgs0qks7s@mail.nycap.rr.com>

Hi Jerry,

I'm not sure exactly what type of security you're referring to.  The term 
"security" usually encompasses several different components.  One of these 
is validation, which Xitami provides in the form of username/password 
prompts.  This is the one of the simplest forms of validation.  Once you 
validate with a username and password, your connection is "trusted" by the 
server, and you can send and receive data (within your privledges).

If you want security "of the actual data being transmitted," you're 
probably looking for encryption.  I am not aware that Xitami provides 
encryption on the fly like that, although I am not an expert at this.  If 
Xitami were to encrypt data, it would have to be some sort of encryption 
that can be decrypted by a web browser, FTP client, or even a DOS 
session.  I am not aware of any type of "decryption" algorithm or process 
that occurs at, for example, a simple DOS prompt telnet session.

Perhaps I'm just not reading your question correctly.  If you know the 
username and password for an FTP server (any server), I'm not sure what 
other security could be provided "on the fly," and if it was, I'm not sure 
what kind of additional authentication process you'd have to go through in 
order to read the data.

Can you give an example of a feature on a different FTP server that does

Under the [Security] section of your *.cfg file, use
webmask=!<IP address or range>,*

i.e.

[Security]
   webmask=!211.*,*

would block 211.0.0.0/8, but let through everything else (the trailing
",*" is important).

Jerry,
	I located a very nice FTP program that may give you what you're
asking for. It is File Share Pro and you can download a copy of it at
www.wfshome.com . I've got it running on the same server as my Xitami.
You can set it up to require a Username and Password and it will give
you a daily log of who, when and what your users downloaded. I
implemented it so my company can track the sales force's updating their
material costs. I "tried" it for a couple of weeks and it works so well,
I purchased a copy of it from Wfshome. As far as there being
security/encryption of the data being transferred, the FTP protocol does
not offer that and was never designed to do so. If that is what you
desire, I'd look into some of the "Blow Fish" encryption technologies.
These programs are usually very inexpensive and do indeed provide some
extreme security. A good suggestion would be to "Blow Fish" encrypt the
files you put on your FTP site and give your user the "Blow Fish'
decryption program and the password to enable them to extract your
encrypted files. Drop me a line if you can't locate an encryption
program and I'll see if I can dig one up for you.

Hi Jerry,

I'm not sure exactly what type of security you're referring to.  The
term 
"security" usually encompasses several different components.  One of
these 
is validation, which Xitami provides in the form of username/password 
prompts.  This is the one of the simplest forms of validation.  Once you

validate with a username and password, your connection is "trusted" by
the 
server, and you can send and receive data (within your privledges).

If you want security "of the actual data being transmitted," you're 
probably looking for encryption.  I am not aware that Xitami provides 
encryption on the fly like that, although I am not an expert at this.
If 
Xitami were to encrypt data, it would have to be some sort of encryption

that can be decrypted by a web browser, FTP client, or even a DOS 
session.  I am not aware of any type of "decryption" algorithm or
process 
that occurs at, for example, a simple DOS prompt telnet session.

Perhaps I'm just not reading your question correctly.  If you know the 
username and password for an FTP server (any server), I'm not sure what 
other security could be provided "on the fly," and if it was, I'm not
sure 
what kind of additional authentication process you'd have to go through
in 
order to read the data.

Can you give an example of a feature on a different FTP server that does

this?  Thanks!

Michael

This is good advice, but I wouldn't encrypt the files, I would 
encrypt the connection using SSH or the like. I am in fact doing this 
already, using the Zebedee Secure Tunnel program 
http://www.winton.org.uk/zebedee/ and various free FTP servers 
(chiefly WarFTPd and GuildFTPd). Zebedee both encrypts and compresses 
the network traffic, including control commands, and can be 
configured to act totally transparent to the user. It's an easy and 
totally free way to set up a simple VPN, actually. I have customers 
who have been running this for years with few complaints.

Such solutions can of course be used with Xitami, too, but to be 
brutally honest -- the FTP part of Xitami is not good. Nothing to use 
for anything resembling a "production environment", but somewhat 
usable for just getting small files onto a web site, which of course 
is the reason why it's there to begin with ;-)

To the OP:
1) No, not natively.
2) No.

Hello Michael, Chris, and Magnus,,,,:) :)


THANKS for the Replies.

These confirm that other than the FTP USERNAME and PASSWORD prompts there is no other protection.

And, I apologize that I only asked the 2 questions without describing the details of the situation relative to the Xitami Documentation for USERNAME, PASSWORD, and FILE transfers.

So, here is the detail of what I hope I understand is going on. Please make any corrections to this understanding as you wish. And, I apologize if the wrong terminology is being used.

    From the document description is seems that although the prompts for 
    username and password do provide that level of protection, the 
    actual transmission of the USERNAME and PASSWORD are sent as "CLEAR ASCII TEXT" 
    on the data link.

    If I understand this to be correct, then anyone with a "SNIFFER"  can 
    capture the TCP/IP (or URL) address along with the USERNAME AND PASSWORD 
    from the FTP record for later use. And, it appears that the FTP record is 
    well documented so the code for the SNIFFER should be easy to create.

    And, this includes the transmission of the data contained in files. In this case 
    the files bytes are sent "as is". So, it does not matter if these files are 
    executable files, sensitive database files, text files, or any other type of 
    information, they can be "SNIFFED OUT" and recreated by anyone willing to spend 
    the time to do that sort of stuff.


And, based on most descriptions of FTP packages, if some form of encryption is not available this would be true for those packages and would include the DOS Command Prompt use of FTP.

THANKS for the inputs. The information has provided other things to look at (ftp processes, SSL, VPN stuff, etc.). From these I am sure I can find something that can make available a strong level of security.

The above ight be useful if Jerry is looking to encrypt the *file data*
transferred between server and client.

However, I'm not sure that was his main worry...

[Jerry's original query]

There is absolutely no possibility of encrypting the username/password,
used for authentication by FTP.  This is because the protocol was
designed (over twenty years ago) to expect this information to be
transmitted in the clear (just as the same happens with the telnet
protocol for remote login to other machines).

So for his query:

> >    1. Is there a method to secure the actual data being transmitted
> > using the Xitami Server?

the answer might be yes, with third-party encryption of the data file
contents, but absolutely no way for the authentication phase.  The only
way that might be achieved would be through an ssh session to other
software on the server, and for the latter to permit FTP "login" only
from localhost.

FTP has been around a long time: I've never heard of anyone wanting
encryption of the authentication phase.  I suppose it might be
attainable, through one-time passwords: this would require changes to the
FTP server process.

I somehow doubt the veracity of this assertion; can you give more detail,

Yep, and during that time (over tenty years ago) I remember that a lot of folks, companies, committies, etc. suggested that the username and password for both FTP and TELNET be consealed by some method. If KERMIT is still around I think even KERMIT tranmits this in the "CLEAR". I would have thought by now with all the CRAP going on with HACKERS this would have been provided. It would at leawt provide for not a 100% protection, but a very powerful layer of protection if the USERNAME and PASSWORD was not sent in the "CLEAR". At least with any number of bits of encryption and 128 bit encryption seems good. And, I am finding stuff that does provide this by some means or another. If that involves other processes use of standards such as SSL, if that is the proper use of the term (Secure Sockets Layer) in this context, Tunneling stuff, also any provider's method for VPN stuff, etc. All of which I have not read or studied yet. But, the easy part is to read about these.

Seems there are many applications available that can secure the data file transfer, so this is a "NO BRAINER" to secure data file transmission. 

However, for the security of USERNAME and PASSWORD I do not care if it is FTP or not. The use of FTP was just a starting point!

And, for FTP this may be true, but there seems to be other processes avialable that do provide a secure authentication procedure within their code structure,,,,,I probably should not have used FTP in this context,,,,,I simply used FTP as a starting point for conversation. And, if a provider has taken the FTP standard and wrappped around that standard a method to secure the authetication that that would be acceptable. All this means is that provider's FTP CLIENT as well as their SERVER process would have to be used. I think I remember at least one that did this, but I am sorry that I did not save the link to that discussion. It has been a few days ago that I took a quick look at what may be available and I did not save any to bookmarks. I cannot remember the details in their discussions, but there was a lot of discussion within these that was related to encryption, authetication, and data file transfer.

You can find some if you search for any combination of the words: FTP SECURE AUTHETICATION, VPN, CLIENT, SERVER, etc. Or, maybe some combination of these as exact phrases. These are the words I used for the search and GOOGLE was used. 

When I get the chance I will give this a try and see what I find again. Since this is what I am looking for I will bookmark'em! :) :)

Jerry :) :)

Hi Jerry

Check out "Ability FTP Server " from " Code Crafters" it can use SSL on
passwords and commands. They have a nice email server aswell.

Here is thier url http://www.code-crafters.com

Hi Jerry,

here a link I found searching with Google for an encrypting ftp client. This is a client/server 
application. ( partial free) You can use the client with another server too, BUT xitami ftp server 
is NOT supporting ENCRYPTION as others mentioned as well . Too bad !  -:( -:(

I didn`t look at it closer.

Hello James and Johannes,  :) :)


OK,,,and THANKS for the links, this is GREAT help.

Also, from other information provided, I now understand that Xitami and Xitami PRO use only the minimum of the standard FTP with no implementation to further secure the USERNAME and PASSWORD.

And, thanks to all for the information provided.

There seems to be a large amount of stuff available that can help. It is now a matter of selecting a provider's application.


THANK YOU ALL!!!!

I am getting error messages on my Xitami 2.5c1 that I never got (or get) on
my older Xitami version.  The error comes up on the client window, socket
error, can't connect to socket 148 (or any number of sockets between 102 and

Can anyone tell me what this is or if it needs to be fixed?

Hello !

I still use 2.4d9 because more recent versions didn't work well with my
scripts.
Seems to be one of the most stable versions.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami with php>4.3.0?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0405212330330.4757@trillian.uni>

I've been trying for some time now to get Xitami-<any version> to work
with a php version newer than 4.3.0 -- "out of the box" I get the error
message "No input file specified" if I try to view a .php page.

I looked around a bit and discovered that the newer versions of PHP
require the CGI environment variable SCRIPT_FILENAME, and will not use
the variable SCRIPT_NAME as in the past.
(Search the page http://us4.php.net/features.commandline for
SCRIPT_FILENAME for some more details)

I checked three versions of xitami (2.4d9, 2.4d10, 2.5<latest>) and none
of them appear export the SCRIPT_FILENAME variable.  I tried some other
solutions that people had suggested on the web, such as setting
doc_root, cgi.force_redirect, cgi.fix_pathinfo, and/or include_path in
php.ini ... no luck.

Does anyone have any comments on this?  Is anyone using Xitami with a
relatively new version of php?  I'd like to think that I'm just missing
some painfully obvious thing, but no snakes have jumped out and bitten
me yet :)

In the meantime, I've come up with the following patch for xitami-2.4d9
which appears to work, but is probably not a good way of going about it:

... all I did was add the Script-Filename variable to the list; I used
path_translated because that appears to give the output I need (the full
path of whatever php file is being served).


Comments?  Suggestions?  Barring any better advice, I'm just going to
keep using this, because I'm very happy with Xitami otherwise, and don't
want to go about the baffling ordeal of choosing another web server.

Thanks as usual

maby a stupid thing to say but make sure you have your filter set up
correctly like

[Filter]
  .php=<directory>\php.exe

Hi Elliott,

I too am using 2.4d9 and 2.5 interchangeably, with PHP 4.3.4, all "out of 
the box," and have not had the problem that you have.

I can, however, tell you that I have had a VERY big problem with another 
variable not being made available by Xitami (SYSTEM_ROOT), or any other 
web server for that matter.  This prevented me from using mail(), or any 
socket-based php commands.

After much consternation (and some help from the folks here and at Proto 
Nova), I think that we have determined that it MIGHT be my Windows XP Home 
installation that is the culprit.  I have come up with a workaround for 
that, and am using that until I finish my project, at which time I'll use 
XP Pro.  My solution was to set the variable in an included .php file on 
every web page.  I don't like it, but at least it lets me develop my site 
on schedule.

I'm not sure what your problem is, but I suspect it's big.  :-)  Sorry 
that doesn't help much.  You might find that the problem is in your OS 
rather than your web server/php configuration.

Michael

Hello Listmembers

My question is a bit off topic here in the xitami list, but still related in a way to xitami as 
webserver. Webdesign is new to me as xitami is. To make things short: Does someone know a way to 
disable downloading pictures which are shown on a webpage ?

Thank`s for any help.

Yes, I have xitami configured correctly.  PHP gets called, and PHP
returns the error message that I'm seeing.  Furthermore, in this case I
was upgrading from an older version of PHP and nothing else changed
except the version of PHP.  When that didn't work I tried different
versions of Xitami but didn't change the config files at all.

I don't have anything that uses socket-based php commands, so
SYSTEM_ROOT doesn't appear to be a problem for me.

I don't like setting variables like that, but I suppose it might be
another option.

Personally I think the problem is small - I was able to work around it
by adding a single line to the xitami source, but that doesn't
necessarily mean that I'm doing everything right.  Maybe if there's
anyone out there using Xitami on Linux from source that would be
helpful -- that would certainly help to pinpoint any OS-related issues
-- so far the only responses have been from people running Xitami under
Windows and they seem to have no problems.

Not possible, since the images must be downloaded before they can be 
displayed. And then, the user can look in his cache to find the right 
image. No fancy javascript "<onClick=alert...>" can't prevent this.

Possible solutions:
------------------
1
only display thumbnails and put the full size images in a restricted 
directory (only accessible with password)

2
use software to put your images in pieces and use the browser to display 
the whole image.

Hello Marc,
thank you for the quick respond.
As I mentioned it's new to me, what do you mean with solution 1. Could you explain me that a bit 
more in step by step ?

If you don't already have a default.cfg file, create one (in the install 
directory of Xitami)
This file contains the modifications to the xitami.cfg file (don't modify 
this file).


In the default.cfg file, create an entry:

[Security]
     Filename=defaults.aut


Now create a defaults.aut file with different entries for each directory 
and users
(It's possible this file is already present)

[/directoryname]
     username=password
     seconduser=secondpas

[/seconddirectory]
     user=pass
...


Example in action:

or in German :)

Good example. The "german guess" was  excellent.

But I searched the net yesterday and found 3 different interesting encrypting software. I still 
have to try them out, but it looks even better ( no right click menue and more ).
If you are interested, let me know.

Johannes,

You can use a simple JScript code that disables the typical visitor from
doing a 'right-click' to save images like this:

Paste this code into the HEAD of your HTML document

<HEAD>

<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript1.1">

<!-- Begin
function right(e) {
if (navigator.appName == 'Netscape' &&
(e.which == 3 || e.which == 2))
return false;
else if (navigator.appName == 'Microsoft Internet Explorer' &&
(event.button == 2 || event.button == 3)) {
alert("Sorry, you do not have permission to right click.");
return false;
}
return true;
}

document.onmousedown=right;
document.onmouseup=right;
if (document.layers) window.captureEvents(Event.MOUSEDOWN);
if (document.layers) window.captureEvents(Event.MOUSEUP);
window.onmousedown=right;
window.onmouseup=right;
//  End -->
</script>
</HEAD>



BUT.... This script is *NOT* fool-proof. People can disable JavaScript
support in their browser, use a browser which doesn't support JavaScript, or
use a browser to link directly to the image that you want to protect. Also
the pages and images are normally stored in the user's browser cache (for
viewing later whilst offline) - with a little bit of work, the thief could
find your image in their cache. It also doesn't stop users accessing the
source of your page from the toolbar menus (View | Page Source). You could
attempt to load your page into a window without toolbars - but again this
isn't fool-proof. They can access the page directly, with toolbars, instead
of opening it without them as you intended. There is a tool for Microsoft
Internet Explorer 5 that will encrypt JScript code - but this is only
supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 - and will not allow the scripts
to run on any other browser.

Bearing this in mind, the above script should stop right clicks (and left
button held down, followed by a right click) in both Netscape Navigator and
Microsoft Internet Explorer. It will not stop users who use a Mac - where
the mouse only has one button.

If this script doesn't do what you require (i.e. protect your images and or
your scripts) then don't use it and don't put your images/scripts on the
net. If your livelihood relies on people not copying your images - then add
a water mark or "sample" stamp to your images.

I'm realy interested. The only encoding method i use regularly (for html) 
is gzip compression, but that's not encryption.

c:  http://www.designerwiz.com/ants/product.htm

I only started to check with c: yet. Easy set up, the single pages are working correctly. I use for 
my pages frames, and I run in a problem with IE 6 and Nestcape 7.1(right click still available). I 
wrote the support, they answered right back and will have a look at my pages and my programm 
settings to find the cause. Haven't heard yet back. 
With one of the other ones I noticed briefly that you can set even a password for a given time 
periode to an image file. I like that idea too.
Just have a look for yourself. Maybe we can share some more ideas.

This is not encryption, but encoding (like FM-encoding music and speach: 
you can't hear anything more, but a simple radio will do the decoding for 
you). And BTW, your pages will grow some 50% in size.

The resulting page (source) looks very undecypherable, but as more and more 
pages will be encoded, you will find more decoders available on the net. 
Back to zero again.
Did a search on google and the first link is already a hit:
http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?threadid=256227

It will prevent users with basic skills from stealing from your site, but 
it's not a problem for a die-hard cracker.
Since it relies on javascript (again), some people with javascript disable 
will not see anything.
And there are so much variations in javascript, that a page that works in 
IE will fail in mozilla, or Opera, or ...

The only "real" protection, is some encryption (and for the key, you must 
connect to a protected site). All secure sites (banking, pay-per-view, 
adult, ...) uses some sort of server-validation

The only interesting thing about b is the graphic splicer.

What it comes down to is the idea to prevent the easy "right click and save" option for the basic 
user.

I personally "hate" javascript to enable, so I guess NOT an option.
Will have to think of another way.

Hi Jill,

found that info on the net too, and didn't liked the idea, because of Jscript and the way around 
it. 
But thank's for the input.

When I run across websites that employ either of these techniques, I

I don't know a WHOLE lot about web design, but I use Dreamweaver to do a 
lot of mine.  I have found that the following code:

<div id="Layer1" style="position:absolute; left:8px; top:11px; 
width:533px; height:146px; z-index:1"><img src="/global/clear.gif" 
width="400" height="100"></div>

Will place a gif in on a "layer" overtop of my image.  This gif is just a 
clear image, the same size as the picture.  I can see through this image, 
but my right-clicks register on the clear image instead of the picture 
behind it.  Therefore, any right (or left) click views/saves the clear 
image.

I haven't played with it a lot, and it doesn't address the web cache 
issue, but there ya go.  :-)

Hi all,
=20
I=92m sure this is rather an obvious question but I seem to be getting a
bit stuck here. I wanted to set up Xitami to run on my local XP machine,
with virtual hosts for each of my sites (work in progress I take home).
I have some experience setting up the hostname and DNS on a live *nix
box with apache but this machine is completely offline. Is this
possible? How would the DNS work on localhost? Any pointers/tutorials
would be greatly appreciated.
=20
Thanks,
=20
Kino

Hi Nick,
=20
take a look at your system folder in the systems32/drivers/etc
directory. I'm not completely sure about XP, but there should be a file
called hosts, which is sth. like the local SOA and has entries like
=20
127.0.0.1       mylocal.machine.net
127.0.0.1       vhost1.local.net
127.0.0.1       vhost2.local.net
=20
If you're using a proxy for your internet connection, you have to add to
add these domains (*.local.net and *.machine.net) to the "don't use
proxy for these sites" list in the browser you're using
(tools/connections/proxy settings or similar - I have a german version
here, so I don't know the correct english terms)
=20
good luck!
Thomas

Hello Michael,

And I'm STARTING with web design, but that is actually all what I want to achive; not to be able to 
save the picture in an "easy" way. Maybe that didn't came properly over. Sorry!
And I don't have to force the viewer to use Jscript to be able to see the web sites. -:)
I just have to find out how to implement that with FP.

Johannes

Hi Nick,
=20
take a look at your system folder in the systems32/drivers/etc
directory. I'm not completely sure about XP, but there should be a file
called hosts, which is sth. like the local SOA and has entries like
=20
127.0.0.1       mylocal.machine.net
127.0.0.1       vhost1.local.net
127.0.0.1       vhost2.local.net
=20
If you're using a proxy for your internet connection, you have to add to
add these domains (*.local.net and *.machine.net) to the "don't use
proxy for these sites" list in the browser you're using
(tools/connections/proxy settings or similar - I have a german version
here, so I don't know the correct english terms)
=20
good luck!
Thomas

Subject: [Xitami] setting up virtual hosts locally
Hi all,
=20
I=92m sure this is rather an obvious question but I seem to be getting a
bit stuck here. I wanted to set up Xitami to run on my local XP machine,
with virtual hosts for each of my sites (work in progress I take home).
I have some experience setting up the hostname and DNS on a live *nix
box with apache but this machine is completely offline. Is this
possible? How would the DNS work on localhost? Any pointers/tutorials
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Hi Johannes,

Yes, the tips here are good but as they say saving the page or using any
site ripper will let people take your images. 

The only foolproof way is use a watermark in Photoshop but again this
depends on the situation and how visible you want the protection.

http://www.candeekis.com/pswatermark/pswmtut.html

I found a quick tutorial for you on this, hope it helps. You can also
digitally protect the image using the DIGIMARC filter but this is not
visible to the viewer, it will however allow you to claim ownership of
the image in cases of dispute.

------------------------------------------------------

A watermark is used to protect your image copyright in case somebody
steals your work and claims the rights to it. You can protect any of
your graphic work by embedding a watermark in it. To create photoshop
watermark, first opne the image you would like to use. Now, go to
Filter>Digimarc>Embed Watermark. Now simply put the year in the blank
field and press OK. You now have a watermark embedded into your graphic.
If you want to read the watermark go to Filter>Digimarc>Read Watermark
to see the embedded watermark information. Embedding watermarks in your
artwork is a good way to protect your work in case somebody claims the
rights for it.

------------------------------------------------------

Best,

Kino

Hello,

I am  trying to use xitami under windows 2000. I always get the message
Could not open port 80  Protocol not known (no error).
Ping to 127.0.0.1 works fine and I use the computer in an LAN already.

I also installed the Apache-Web-Server for test purposes and the
Apache-Web-Server works also fine.
Could anybody tell me why Xitami  can not be started?

Any help would be appreciated very much.

Hi Nick

Thomas gave you good advice for a lone pc. If  you are useing a peer to peer
network and need the sites to be seen by all network peers. you should use
the ip for your network interface card not the 127.0.0.1 loopback ip. I copy
a master host file to all the pc's in our network.

sample......................................................................
.......

#IP Address     Name                  Comments

127.0.0.1          localhost              #Loop back IP/Name

PHP is not working.  I have the file:

I see a blank web page not "Hello World".

There's something very simple I'm not understanding or not doing(?)
I have a feeling something obvious I'm not doing. Win2k, xitami 2.5b2

Is there any more info I should give? Would someone assist me?
I'd really appreciate support - to get php working with xitami.
Here's a rewrite of my previous plea for help:


Hi,
Using Win2k

Wanting to learn php I have,
php-4.3.6-installer.exe
bw3225b4.exe  (the xitami server)

I installed the server first - works OK, cgi works for perl.
The install php asked what server- I said xitami. The
xitami admin filter page and pip.ini seem correctly
configured by the php eg. cgi.force_redirect = 0,
there's a  pip.ini and php4ts.dll in C:\WINNT now.

With Xitami running I browse over to a helloworld.php
file on my harddrive - nothing shows up - just blank
white background. What should i do now?
Thanks for the support,
Lee G.

You'll need to have set up your defaults.cfg file too. The most important 
lines in that will be these:

    .php=C:\PHP\php.exe
    .php3=C:\PHP\php.exe

(naturally your path may be different). I have 97 lines in my defaults.cfg, 
and some virtual host .cfg files too. But the settings above are the first, 
and I think you should begin to see results once you've added them.

lee, just a dumb question but a possible. In you post you have a typo
calling php.ini pip.ini, check it, supposed to be php.ini of course.

Another item I thought of later: use a php file with the following three
lines in it
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
Put in the root of the web server and use a browser to go to it.
This gives (should) all of the infomation available to display on php and
your server.

my 2 cents...

...you call it 'pip.ini' twice. Is this really what you have and are you 
sure this is correct?
don't have 4.3.6 but it was php.ini for years and up to at least 4.3.3.

Hi Lee,

Two other troubleshooting things you might try:

1) Create a php file with an intentional error in it.  Do you get an error 
message on the resulting web page?  That might help determine if Xitami is 
even firing up the php compiler.  To create an even worse error, rename 
php.exe to something else, and see what error you get.  If you don't get 
an error THERE, then you know the server is not being properly instructed 
on how to treat php files.

2) Create a php file (either pure php or php/html mix), put it in the same 
directory as your php.exe, and in a DOS prompt, type php.exe <filename>.  
This will run the php compiler outside the web server environment.  The 
php.exe should spit out the html code for your page, right there in the 
DOS prompt.  That will tell you if php is working properly, regardless of 
what server you use.

You also might want to run Patrick's three line php file at the DOS prompt 
too.  Send the output to an html file, and view that output on the 
server.  For example, save the following three lines as phpinfo.php, and 
put it in your PHP folder:

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

Then at the DOS prompt, run php.exe phpinfo.php > phpinfo.html.  And then 
view phpinfo.html with your web browser.  Compare that page with what you 
get when you look at phpinfo.php from the server.

Oh, and make sure you aren't using a .css file that turns your text to 
white! (just kidding)

Have you tried chm files? (compiled html files).
This is a thing only Microsoft uses, for their online manuals. But since 
nobody is interested in the inner working of a Microsoft manual, there are 
no hackers to convert chm back to html (google for htm2chm, and then chm2htm)

Basically, all the files comprised in a site are compiled into one single 
chm file, but once loaded into internet explorer, the chm file works just 
like plain old htm files.
And what's still better: these files are also compressed! (compression 
ratio equivalent to gzip).
You have a faster response (all the links are in one single file), but if 
you want to change one single html file, you must recompile the whole thing.
Try http://web.verfaillie.com/cgi/e.htm, where you can find both versions 
of the same html file.

I think this is the solution to your problem!

Try to search "chm decompiler" ... about 2080 results;-)
