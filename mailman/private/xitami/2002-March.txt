Subject: [Xitami] PHP, Virtual Domains & New Features in Xitami
Message-ID: <3C7FCB0B.981AD47B@alum.rpi.edu>

Ok, I have a whole host of questions, some for
Xitami development and some for whomever knows the
answer.

1) When is the next major/minor release for
xitami?

2) What new features and/or options can we expect?
Are you taking any suggestions?
    (multi-user admin would be nice)

3) For those of you running PHP and/or Perl, how
do you setup either program types so that it runs
securely for some virtual domains (that i specify)
and will run completely free of restrictions for
other domains. For example I need to have full
control oh PHP and Perl on my system for my own
development reasons but I want to run it in safe
more with base_dir turned on for some other
people's virtual domains on my system.

I know apache can achieve this by using php as a
module and even on windows you can assign user to
the module and whatnot. Is any of this possible
with Xitami? (I would like to stick with xitami
for as long as possible)

Please note: I run Xitami on Windows 2000, so
answers for other operating systems may not work.

Thanks

I have absolutely no idea.  Xitami doesn't have a release schedule as
such, and doesn't really have anyone with time to concentrate on its
development.  I suggest not holding your breath.

>2) What new features and/or options can we expect?  Are you taking any

Due to the aforementioned lack of release schedule there's no real list
of new features/options either.  GSL3 has been integrated into our
development version, but I have no idea if that'll be in the next release.  

You're welcome to make suggestions, but there's absolutely no guarentee
that they'll be in the next release unless those suggestions are
accompanied by code implementing the suggestion (and not even then if
integrating the feature to the existing development code is tricky).

What would it take to get Imatix to find the time? I assume that money 
would be required to attract someone's attention.

So on that note perhaps you should give us some hints about the answers 
to questions like How much? for how long? and to produce what? I'm 
thinking that if you told the community the price then those of us with 
money and a list of bugs/features might be willing to stump up. If you 
don't tell us you are highly unlikely to get any response.

Also on a somewhat related note: if I were to develop and sell a setup 
that included xitami web server would you like a cut of the money and 
would you then be willing to provide me or my customers with support?

The issue is, at base, that no one is working on development of Xitami
at anything even approaching full time (or really "at all" most of the
time to be honest).

The only "iMatix" contribution to Xitami at present is (a) providing the
site/bandwidth to host the Xitami site, and (b) my occassional posts
here (and those are over and above all my paid work -- there's no "paid
to support Xitami" going on here).  (There are a small number of people
who have paid for Xitami support in the past, who do get support, but
this number of people has not historically been enough to fund even a
part time developer, and it doesn't go towards, eg, paying me.)

There are basically two ways to go from here:
(a) Xitami development can be taken over by "the community" like a
    "traditional" open source project.  Everything that is needed to
    maintain Xitami is now open source as far as I remember (apart from
    the SSL support -- and that could be replicated by a skilled, 
    determined programmer in a week or two if they put their mind to it).

(b) iMatix somehow figures out a way to make money out of Xitami, so
    that it can afford to "dedicate" someone to working on Xitami.  (To
    be a practical proposition it'd need to fund at least half the time
    of a reasonably skilled developer; if it funds less than that
    they'll be given other work to do which will gradually take up all 
    their time (work expands to fill the time available).)

There has been various discussion at iMatix about ways to make money out
of Xitami so as to fund on-going development.  Xitami hasn't been used
in any major projects iMatix has done in at least the last two years;
even prior to that it was largely a "technology demo" rather than an
attempt at an independant product.  It's been rather more successful
than was originally planned.

Funding Xitami development from sales of Xitami/Pro, or commercial
licensing/support has been tried, and at least the way it's been done to
date, it simply does not provide enough money to fund more than
problem-focused development (eg, a customer has a specific problem and
that is investigated).

Unless there's some way to dramatically increase the number of
sales/support licences bought, it's not a practical model to fund
development.  Given the huge number of other webservers around,
including several being given away by people with Very Deep Pockets (eg,
IIS by Microsoft), a lot of people understandably simply use what they 
get for free.

Personally I think the only viable model to move forward is the
"community development" model, ie, reasonably sizable contributions from
non-iMatix people.  There have been some very good contributions in the
past, but not in sufficient quantities/focus to get to the point of a
new release/new features.

I should note, though, that management at iMatix HQ are not in favour of
"community-driven open source" style development, to the point where
it is likely that the public access to the "open source" CVS archive
at iMatixHQ will be removed, and access to the software limited to
occassional releases.

That isn't necessarily a problem: a "community driven" Xitami
development could be hosted somewhere else, based on what is currently
publically available.  I could possibly even host it on one of my
(personal) servers on the Internet.

The pay-for-development model could possibly be mixed with the
"community driven" model by, say, allowing people to sponsor a
particular feature (eg, offering to pay money to add something to the
program).  So people who want something in particular but aren't
developers themselves could still have a way of getting that feature.

Finally, FWIW, "half a developers time" is worth at least US$2500/month
(to the business; the developer may not necessarily be getting twice
that amount each month, but there's also all the overheads of providing
the developer somewhere to work, etc.)

If someone can think of a way to provide a regular US$2000/month or so
towards Xitami development, I'm all ears.  I'd like to see Xitami continue
to develop, but the only way to do that is for people to work on it --
and the only way to do that in the context of a business if for there
to be some advantage (eg, money) in doing so.

>Also on a somewhat related note: if I were to develop and sell a setup 
>that included xitami web server would you like a cut of the money and

This is definitely something that we can talk about.  Providing the
money can cover the costs of providing the support (give or take a bit)
it's quite probable something can be arranged.

Email me off list (ewen@imatix.com) and we can talk about it.

As it stands ... today .. Xitami fills so many needs. Notwithstanding the price.

If it stays the way it is for several more years, this suits me ok, and I will continue to use Xitami as my web server.

Thanks for all your efforts in keeping everybody moving !

It seems there is enough with Xitami so that "new features" are not a requirement .. but more an investigative thought.

It's a web server. It works. It's fast. It's secure. Application development .. I use Shockwave, VB for CGI and PHP.

What more could I ask for ???  IIS ?

Thanks for all your help Ewen.

I second that. Let them make improvements as time permits. Xitami as is,

Simple question.  I was using Steve Gibson's ID Serve

I've very probably changed settings and might be missing more 
than I thought.  What types of hits / information queries do not 
show up in Xitami logs?  Is this the limit to the kind of information 
someone can get from my Xitami machine without my knowing 
about it?  I'm not really concerned, just curious.

But why doesn't Xitami let me know when it gives out *any* kind of

Hmmm.... my first guess is that Steve does a HEAD command, which
fetches the HTTP header without the content. 

If Xitami doesn't log that, it is interesting but not necessarily
"wrong".

I think it should be correct because the server runs on port 80. but
make sure you don't put anything confidential in the web folder or if u
do protect it

Yes.

You can run Xitami's HTTP server on another port using the portbase
option.

Then a different port will be open, and everyone who accesses your site
will need to use:

http://yoursite.example.com:portno/....

which wouldn't be terribly useful.

Always wondered how they spidered my Xitami sites without 
leaving a log entry.  I guess I better stop leaving love notes in the 
headers...

If on NT, you can manipulate the control pannel apps.
On WinXX you might try sending the EXE command line parms with the 'SHELL' command in VB.
(I'd have to look up the exact syntax)

The answer is yes and yes.  But only one is relevent to this list.

Advanced (and off-topic for this list).  Use C++ or Delphi.  If you 
insist on VB, you can use API calls to identify and kill any running 
shell32 process.  If you are not familiar with api, this will ruin any 
social life you had hopes for and may require 2 gallons of Mountain 
Dew.

Much more simple (and slightly more relevent to this list) just 
minimize Xitami without sending it to the systray.  It's easy when
using Xitami to overlook this ability.  Now you can recognize and 
kill Xitami just like any other app on the taskbar using Sendkeys 
(or a few other standardized methods) and using only a couple 
lines of code.

I logon on to Xitami WBA, go to server console, and then to details; the screen shows all the current connections.  Unfortunately all the screen will show are 20 out of however many connection you have at the time.  Is there anyway to increase that number or to show all the connections in use at the time?  Thanks ahead of time, Jesse.

Hello all

I would like to be able to do this with respect to Xitami. Basicaly what I would like to do is

1)Create a web site, that points to http://localhost/PyTest/
 where PyTest is pointing to a folder where my python scripts are kept (c:\Python\scripts)

2)Also my cgi-bin directory should be also c:\Python\scripts, so that I can run scripts by just typing it in the 
url like http://locahost/PyTest/PyHello.py

Any pointers are greatly appreciated.

Hi all,

Newby questions again:

My current setup is DSL>modem>Linksys>PC#1 (Xitami); with forwarding on
Linksys so all port 80 calls points to a PC#1's IP address.  I am using
Register.com as my external DNS server.

I want to set up an intranet for all PCs under the Lynksys.  I can get it to
work as localhost.

Question: Is there a way to name it to something other than localhost?
Question: If I want to install another Xitami in say PC#2 for this intranet,
and leave PC#1's Xitami for all external calls?  how should I do it so it
won't fight with PC#1's Xitami

Thanks for helping

Wait for it to be mailed out at the start of the month, or contact the

Look it up in the .aut file?

    Hello all I'm new to the list but not to xitami. I can get around in =
it just fine and am currently hosting RickHart.net from my home machine. =
It's a Windows 98 machine.
    I have downloaded and installed ActiveState's ActivePerl for Windows =
32. The Perl executable is at C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe. I have tried =
everything to get this setup so that xitami will call on that program =
everytime it comes across a .cgi or .pl file. I have used the filters =
but nothing works. They are in the CGI-BIN folder also. Please Help.
    If anyone else has had experience with this I would appreciate a =
hand.

Thank you all,
Alex

Setup Xitami on PC#2 just like you did on PC#1. Since you won't be port
forwarding to it, the outside will never see it. Make sure there is a name for
PC#2 in your hosts file, use that name in the URL when trying to access the
local web-server.

Message-ID: <C3B69919485CD31180680060942F8E4A034C6F77@ms0156t0.brux.rb.be>

Hi all,  I have a question !  

Problem:
When I access my start page, that contains a .pl script, I get the download
pop-up message, asking me what I want do do with the start.pl script; open
this file from its current location or save this file to disk !!  That's not
what I want.    

Solution:
I am quit sure the problem lies in the xitami server config since the .pl
script has been tested extensively.  Here's what I've done/what happens:  
When I run it from the current location, a dos window opens that blocks.    
I installed the perl .api and associated .pl with perl exe's when installing
(of course).    

Any help greatly appreciated ;))

Best Regards, 

Nico

If you are on windows you should right click on it and 'open with' perl and
have it set to always use this program

No not a problem with Xitami...
You need to place your script in your cgi-bin directory or cgi alias...
If you need this to be your default page take a look in the faq :

Xitami will only run scripts in the cgi-bin directory or subdirectories 
of there. A file in the webpaqges directory is sent to the user ratehr 
than executed on the webserver.

If you want your default page (i.e. http://my.domain.com/ to run a perl 
script then you should probably create a redirection html file as 
default.htm (or index.htm) with contents like:
<html><head>
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; URL=/cgi-bin/myscript.pl">
</head></html>

For more advanced users:
I use a trivial xml / gsl combo because I can redirect all ovber the 
place with that - it also allows you to use a frameset with 1 frame to 
hide the new URL and makes it easier to maintain changes.

the gsl file (called relo.gsl) is below

ok, I'll into that again.  
Problem is that the .exe I have, installed the .htlm and .pl files, I think
correctly.  I'm not sure to start changing fileneames: the index is
index.html and it calls welcome.pl which on its turn calls again lots of
other perl scripts.  Slhould I create a new cgi-bin directory on my alias
and move all .pl files to that directory.  I feel unco,fortable with that. 
Any comments are welcome, nico

I solve this by going  from ISP > Modem > Hub > Router
I plug Router into Hub. Hub into Modem.
The  external PC is connected to HUB, internal machines
connected to router.

External PC is given a dedicated IP that I have purchased.
Internal PC's get IP from router.

Hope this helps

> how to create a host file?

You surely already have one.

On my XP box it is at C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

Win9x is different. Start, Find (or Search), Files, "hosts".

There may be hosts.sam and lmhosts. In rare cases there is no hosts
file, just the lmhosts (which is for Windows Networking). Copy one
of those, edit, save as "hosts".

Open it in NotePad. It has some comments (marked by "#") and then a
list of IP numbers and machines. Here's the default:

 #      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
 #       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host
 127.0.0.1       localhost

The acme.com entries are bogus examples, and because of the "#" are
ignored.

The "127.0.0.1 localhost" entry is how your machine finds
"localhost".

Add some lines like

 127.0.0.2  bedroom
 127.0.0.3  kitchen
 127.0.0.4  attic

Use the IP numbers you or your router assigned to your in-house
machines. Most routers use a 168... range instead of the 127...
range.

Save the file (and be sure NotePad doesn't stick a TXT extension on
it!).

On the same machine, now "http://kitchen" should open the web server
on the machine 127.0.0.3

So that every machine in the house knows the name-IP assignments for
all the other machines, copy your custom HOSTS file to the right
folder on every machine in the house.

If you let your router do DCHP, each machine's IP number may change
at each re-boot. That's no good for a static hosts file. Tell your
router to reserve some fixed IP numbers for those machines that will
have "public" (in-house) names and services, or turn off DCHP on
those machines and hand-enter IP numbers (being sure the router is
told not to use those numbers in DCHP for other machines).

That HOSTS file is how we used to do it. Much better than a printout
tacked to the wall and typing IP numbers by hand. When the ARPAnet
was dozens of machines, it was cool. But in bigger networks, it gets
cumbersome to keep adding new machines to the file and copying the
file to all other machines. ARPAnet choked when there were thousands
of machines on the net and these HOSTS files had to be updated and
distributed nightly.

That's where DNS is better. One machine holds all the data and other
machines ask it to look-up IP numbers for names they don't know. You
could set up your own in-house DNS service, but it is really more
work than a typical home LAN justifies, especially if there are only
a few machines that need to be "known" to others as DNS names.

I desire to control Xitami-- to start and kill it --from a Visual Basic
program. Starting is no problem, but it starts in the systray. That makes
killing it a real problem. In VB it is more straightforward to kill programs
that are in windows - either normal or minimized.

I thought there was some way to run Xitami in a window vs system tray.

OS I am interested in is  win 9x, ME, 2000, and XP.

Also in my XP sysem, it seems Xitami is loaded as a service vs and
application. Is it possible to load it as an app and NOT as a service

Thanks for the help

Dead-easy.

Internet Explorer works. It may work better in later versions; I
have 6 here. NetScape 4.7 works too.

ftp://username@server.domain.org

You will be promoted for your password. There is a way to give the
password in the URL; and IE also offers to save your password
locally. I prefer to keep it to myself and type it in, but whatever
works for your users.

If it likes your name and password, you can navigate folders, view
files, etc.

AND... open a File Explorer window, find files on your own PC, and
drag them into the browser window. IE just uploads them; NS asks if
that's what you want to do.

Working fine on my Xitami 2.4 server. I know I never had any file
upload add-ons.

Xitami's FTP will time-out after some minutes. I'm not sure all
browsers handle this gracefully. Best to know what you want to do
and do it all in one sitting.

 Unfortunately there does not seem to be any Visual basic LRWP framework
that I can find. There was a DLL released several years and it does work,
but it generates a GUI and window that you cannot get rid of or minimize, so
hence have to write some source code!  I used the frameworks provided as
templates, but my  c programming is very poor.

There are API's for dealing with programs that run in the tray or

You can deal with the Windows API directly ( what fun ! ),
or find some after market OCX type product.

Check out www.desaware.com or www.winfiles.com
You will get better results on this quesiton on a VB list.
The technique you will use will work on all services or 
programs in the 'tray'.

Hi.
It is true, WML works.
You have to use different headers in CGI - correspondig with mime types for 
WML.
And serve WML content, of course.

As far as I know it works fine.  At least one of those (and I think
both) are basically just text formats anyway, so shouldn't need any
special treatment other than setting the MIME type so the client
receiving it knows what to expect.

If you're doing it from a CGI, you can just output a Content-Type: line.

Chances are really strong that your LRWP program isn't "playing by the
protocol" in some respect, and what you're seeing is a deadlock rather
than a hung TCP connection.  You might want to double check your code is
sending the right amounts for each thing, and at least as
importantly that it's being flushed out to the network not buffered
somewhere.

Network sniffing/snooping can be very valuable in debugging this type of
issue.

Subject: [Xitami] Help: Virutal Host !!
Message-ID: <2C61CCE8A870D211A523080009B94E43071C78F9@HQ5>

Hello All
I need to do this in Xitami, which I can do in IIS5.0

1)Create a virtual host called PyCgi so that it points to E:\\Sunit\\XMLFiles\\PyXml\\Scripts
2)Be able to point to http://localhost/PyCgi/PyTest.py and runmy python scripts.
3)Be able to bring a default page when pointing to http://localhost/PyCgi

I have tried creating a virtual host thru. the admin options but still it does't work. Also setup an alias, but still no luck. Below are the sections from  defaults.cfg and PyCgi.cfg

---defaults.cfg-------

#*END

[Security]
    Filename = "defaults.aut"

[Server]
    Cgi-bin = "./"
    Cgi-url = "/"
    Default3 = "index.cgi"
    Priority = "1"
    Webpages = "./"

[Virtual-hosts]
    * = "PyCgi.cfg"

-----PyCgi.cfg--------

#*END

[Accesslog]
    Filename = "PyCgi.log"

[Security]
    Filename = "PyCgi.aut"

[Server]
    Cgi-bin = "E:\\Sunit\\XMLFiles\\PyXml\\Scripts"
    Cgi-url = "/"
    Default3 = "index.html"
    Default4 = "intro.html"
    Webpages = "E:\\Sunit\\XMLFiles\\PyXml\\Scripts"

[Wsx]
    Admin = ""


Any pointers are greatly appreciated.

thanks
Sunit

Can I run www.four-banger.net and www.mrhymbaugh.com from the same computer
with xitami?  These are two completely different sites.  Right now they are
both going to the same site.

Forgot a little info.  I am hosting over my home DSL.  I am using
www.zoneedit.com for DNS since I don't have a static IP.

thanks

I'm at my office and couldn't get to the archives for some reason.

Register both names with your DNS, to the same machine. I think you
already have that working.

In Xitami's web-administration screen, click "V-Host Wizard". Click
"New".

Make up a name for the config file. Leave IP address blank; put
"www.mrhymbaugh.com" in "...DNS host name:".

"Web page root directory:" is the folder where this site's home page
is.

While the docs suggest that a relative path can work, I've had best
luck using an absolute path like "d:/wwwroot/Imlc". Use the forward
slashes, this isn't DOS. If you were on unix, you'd use the exact
letter-case.

For starters, you can ignore all else. Save Save Save until you
get back to the top Admin screen.

Now, stop Xitami completely, freshen your coffee, and restart it.
That isn't supposed to be necessary; X should note the modified
config file and re-read it within a minute. But some of us feel that
it is sometimes reluctant to do so. Killing it and cold-starting it
forces it to get the new configuration.

Also, whack your browser. Explorer in particular (but also NS) hates
to re-read a page if it thinks it "hasn't changed". It can't
understand that the URL is no longer supposed to go to the same
file. Leaning on Ctrl-F5 will sometimes make it go to all the
trouble of actually getting the page.

Do the same for your four-banger. It can point to your main HTML
folder, or a sub-folder.

If a request comes to your machine and does not match any of the
V-Hosts you have defined, they will get Xitami's default page,
probably your Pub Crawl page. That would happen if the page were
requested by IP number instead of name (though that is very unlikely
for your dynamic IP), or super-old browsers that do not say (in the
HTTP header) where they think they are going. So be sure that page
gives them what you want, or at least nothing too dumb.

Thanks for the reply.  Yeah, I have had the four-banger site running fine
for a year, then I decided to add mrhymbaugh.com for non automotive pics,
etc...

I think I see a couple of things I did wrong.  I'll take a look at it when I
get home.  Imagine what my car buddies (four-banger.net) are thinking when
they get a site being set up for my wife and my friends.  LOL

Now I also need to dig through the archives and fix the problem of xitami
being on my control panel also.  Every time I restart my computer I have to
go into control panel, open the xitami there, suspend it, then start up the
right xitami.

Thanks again, this and another reply I got make a little more sense.

the XP or NT account under which Xitami runs.
This account needs permissions to the PHP folder too,
where PHP is installed.

In the environment, you may have to set the path to PHP folder.

(In addition to setting the [Filter] in Defaults.cfg (Xitami).

All I had to do was install xitami and then I install php then it
configured it for me. If u install PHP in the default directory it makes
life easier for you. ASfter that make sure you have the filter .php or
.php3 and pointing to your executable files which would be c:\php if u
installed it in there

What "tested web infrastructure"?

Which "buttons"?

you should post your article to: activeperl@listserv.ActiveState.com

however, you need to register with the site first before you can post to the
forums.  It sounds like a directory read deleting your .pl files....post me
the code that is causing the deletes.

Hi.

I was wondering if anyone has come across any problems/bugs with this 
version 2.5b4?  Currently i am using 2.4d6, and just want to verify that i 
am not going to encounter any headaches with upgrading.

Thanks for your thoughts and time!

You should use either 2.4d9 or 2.5b5.  2.5b4 may or may not be okay
depending on which version you get, as there were build issues with some
of them.

You can get both 2.4d9 and 2.5b5 from http://www.xitami.com/

you should post your article to: activeperl@listserv.ActiveState.com

however, you need to register with the site first before you can post to the

the code that is causing the deletes.

Thanks all,
it's an application from mercury I installed, MercuryWebTours.  When I click
'server options' and some other buttons, I get 404 and as a bonus all my
scripts are gone.  I already reinstalled on on other machine, NT iso Win98,
but same thing happens.  I think I'll have to start in perl.

It _should_ work with 2.4d9 and 2.5b5, and I'd be interested in reports
if it doesn't.  There are bugs in all the previous 2.4d and 2.5b
versions which will cause issues with return amounts > 16KB (size where
it changed from all-in-memory to spool-to-disk).

FWIW, returning 40MB from a LRWP (or CGI or whatever) isn't all that
efficient; a 40MB temporary file will be written.  It's perhaps better
to issue a redirect to the location of the file.

Ewen,

Thanks for the response.

What im trying to do is post a tar file (40 to 50 MB) to a device that has
a Xitami web server running.  The tar is used to reinitilize the device.
I can post with a regular cgibin but the post data part of the lrwp does not
all come through.

Http may seem awkward for this but it allows an upload to happen through port
port 80 which may be the only port open on some fire walls... (ftps may not be
allowed).

If you can't tell us what it does, you are going to have to tell us
exactly where to find it so someone else can look at the code.
Google doesn't find me anything useful for "MercuryWebTours",
"Mercury Web Tours" brings up hundreds of pages that are clearly not
right.

But I agree with Russel-- this has to be an issue with the script,
not Xitami. Since it is probably Perl, post to the Perl discussion
group Russel cited, and tell them where they can study the script.

only thing you can do is point your DNS entries to a CNAME to a account (say
from dyndns.org) that's dynamic and use thier clients to update.

that won't work for MX entries (mail) tho.

what kind of connection do you have?

I've set this up as follows:

1) open an account with zoneedit.com (or similar service) and copy the
"nameservers" from the site that holds them now (namesecure, or whoever you
bought the domain name from)

2) a service like "DirectUpdate" (directupdate.net) once installed on your
machine will notify zoneedit whenever your IP changes.

Has been working fine for me on my cable modem since I set it up a couple
weeks ago, but my IP address hasn't changed in that time either.

If a user goes to my IP address I want the site to default to a VHost =
configuration.  Where would I alias that at?

I thought it would be in the main "configuration" - i changed the HTML =
and CGI directories to point to the VHost directory structure....not =
working though.

Run two copies of Xitami.

Xitami can't listen on two ports at once in a single instance.

Dynhost.com works well for this. And it WILL work for email - it generates
MX entries.

I have set up a webserver with Xitami some time ago.

Since then (I think) my PC has started to crash aprox 1-2 a week.
Can this be a Xitami problem?

If so What is the fix?

If the _PC_ crashes (eg, Windows blue screen) it's unlikely to be Xitami
-- Xitami doesn't do anything low level enough to be causing crashes
like that.  (Although make sure that your operating system patches are
up to date, because ISTR bugs in Windows 95/98 that would cause certain
types of file requests to crash the operating system, and these can
sometimes come in from a URL.)

Generally I'd suggest making sure you've got the latest patches, making
sure there's nothing else likely to be causing the problem running, and
then perhaps reinstalling if that doesn't work.  (I've also seen PCs
"suddenly" start crashing a lot if, eg, the CPU is overheating, or the
memory has gone bad or something, so don't completely rule out hardware
issues.)

I know absolutely nothing about computers or software...but I downloaded both

everything running fine in about 10 mins.

If you need help, webmonkey.com has a good tutorial on installing both those 
(i used it to guide me) on either windows or unix/linux (<-- the other thing

People running Windows 98, 2000, and XP have been

Hi again, 

I think the deletion happens in the code in attach.  I don't know whether
you would have the time to take a look at this file, but it would be greatly
appreciated.  What is a directory read ?!

you should post your article to: activeperl@listserv.ActiveState.com

however, you need to register with the site first before you can post to the

You can right-click on a link and "save as" or "save target as" then 
your file name appears properly.

There are html tricks to get around this intentional browser feature.  
Ftp is a better option.

Nothing in there "should" delete files. However, this code may work
quite oddly under Windows:


sub createDirectories {
    mkdir ("users", 0777) unless (-d "users");
    chdir("users");
    for ($i = 0; $i < 128; $i++) {
                mkdir($i, 0777) unless (-d $i);
    }

If I read it right, it makes folders with names based on IP numbers,
and chmod style permissions. This would work on unix. It "should"
degrade gracefully on NT and Win9x, but you are in an area that I
think WinPerl isn't 1,000% tested.

I'm also curious how it knows where to find its files.

You haven't told us if you run Windows, or if it has been configured
correctly, or if there is a support website that we might study.

&nbsp;I am trying to set up Xitami v2.5b5 on an AMD 686 200 MHz under WIN95c
and am having trouble with FTP as it won't allow anonymous connect via
Netscape browser. Don't know about other browsers, but it sure won't let
me in ;-) First is said security reasons, now it says the port is bad.
I have done nothing to the original port addresses so I assume all should
be well. My WIN95 FTP server had no problems accessing it, but has no security
at all, so I try Xitami. I have not tried pass worded access yet, as I
feel anonymous access would have even less requirements. HTTP access to
web pages works fine out of the box, but the FTP is turning my hair grey.
Any help?</html>

If you make a directory called "home", then you can use:

www.example.com/home/

instead.  (And at the expense of the webserver having to tell the
browser, "hey that's a directory" you can in practice get away without
the final "/" too; there'll be a redirect to the version with the slash.)

>2. Is there a way to prevent showing the files in a directory? ie when a =
>visitor type www.abc.com/pages when "pages" is a directory?

A.  Create an index.html file, or similar, in the directory
B.  Set [Security] dirlist=0  to disable automatic directory listings

Nope.  The directory listing is something that gets done only if it
can't find a "prepared" directory index file (like index.htm).

For those people that care. This is related to Keep-alives and is a 
xitami / Mozilla specific problem I added the following comment to the 
bug above

More infornmation.

1) I installed an Apache server to check. Apache 1.3.23 does not 
apparently have the same problem. Thus bug does not occur with
Xitami server + IE (5.5) client,
Apache server + IE (5.5) client,
Apache server + Mozilla client

only with Xitami server + Mozilla client,
 
Implication: Something is being handled incorrectly be either Xitami or 
Mozilla (under win2k as this works for win 98/ME)

2) I have occasionally seen the same behaviour on remote Xitami servers. 
But too infrequently to troubleshoot. This led me to think about what 
might be wrong and I looked at the Mozilla Debug preferences. By 
Disabling the keep alive feature in the networking section the problem 
is resolved

i.e. a prefs setting of user_pref("network.http.keep-alive", false);

Note that the related setting user_pref("network.http.pipelining", may 
be set to either true or false with no effect. it all depends on the 
keep-alive preference.

3) There is an equivalent setting in Xitami to diable keep-alives. 
Changing this has no effect. The only working solution is to change the 
preference setting in Mozilla

Summary
The combination of Win 2000 + Xitami + Mozilla (with keep-alive enabled) 
causes the bug. Change ANY of these and the bug goes away. This bug has 
occured in all versions of Mozilla from 0.9.6 up to and including the 
latest 0.9.9

If you look closely you'll see the FAQ's are older than XP, by quite a
margin.  (IIRC they're older than Win2K/WinME as well; ISTR we had this
question come up a lot when they came out.)

WinXP is basically an enhanced version of Win NT/Win2K, and so Xitami
should work fine on WinXP as far as we know.

Message-ID: <3C8FF3D0.CFB97D4F@alum.rpi.edu>

Hey all,

I've been wrestling with trying to get JSP's to
work on my site. I'm using the tomcat engine but
I'd like to integrate the engine into my site.

I was wondering if anyone has tried to use the
isapid xitami plugin to use the IIS Tomcat plugin:
isapi_redirect.dll to work with xitami? Any
solutions? I tried to get it to work but I get the
following error:

Today I have been stress testing Xitami under a very controlled environment
with a distributed attack server (DAS) and client (DAC) set.  The DAS and
DAC are multi-threaded applications capable of handling virtually any load
handed to them.  The problem I'm having seems to lie in Xitami when I
exceed 50 simulated simultaneous users (e.g. 50 users constantly hitting
reload).  Here is a sample of the log files for about 10 simultaneous users:

10.5.225.202 - - [13/Mar/2002:00:04:01 -0500] "GET /distattack/dist3.cfm

These are the correct file sizes for this.  Now, when I attempt to simulate
50 simultaneous users, the log file looks like this:

Xitami is returning with a fairly inconsistent zero or two bytes.  Only
once in a while is the correct webpage returned.  Note that 50 simultaneous
users is putting a steady 75-100% CPU load on my processors (the DAS has
only occupied 3 seconds of CPU time in the past 24 hours and the DAC only
consumes about 5 minutes of CPU time every 24 hours).  Xitami has consumed
1 hour of CPU time in the past 24 hours.

Note that XiFusion is not the problem since if I run another scripting
language not tied to XiFusion, I get the same sort of thing in the logs:

192.195.234.26 - - [13/Mar/2002:20:29:27 -0500] "GET /distattack/dist1.pl
HTTP/1.0" 200 0
192.195.234.26 - - [13/Mar/2002:20:29:59 -0500] "GET /distattack/dist2.pl

192.195.234.26 - - [13/Mar/2002:20:30:26 -0500] "GET /distattack/dist2.nvm

192.195.234.26 - - [13/Mar/2002:20:30:07 -0500] "GET /distattack/dist2.pl
HTTP/1.0" 200 0

My best guess is that Xitami is either killing processes (although I have
disabled that feature due to long-running web-based scripts I've written)
or it has hit an OS limit (total number of CGI processes allowed by a
single process).  Is this a known bug or what exactly is going on?  Any
suggestions?

My objective is to stress test up to 100 simultaneous users over a period
of 24 hours for each scripting language...but it looks like I might have to
trim back that objective unless there is another, more viable option.

Without having run into this before myself, my hunch is that there's
perhaps some race condition in Xitami between when the temporary files
are read in (from the CGIs), and when the size of the file is recorded.
In which case this would be most obvious when the load on the machine
gets fairly high (and 50 simultaneous users all running CGIs at once
would start to do that).

Is it only the log entries affected?  Or are the results that are sent
back wrong as well?

These sorts of problems are very time consuming to track down (often
debugging is a matter of staring at the source code to try to figure out
what might be causing it, changing something "likely" and trying again).

If anyone else has seen anything similar and/or has any hints about what
triggers it, it'd be useful to know.

Hi guys.

I restarted my xitami 2.5b5 server (W2K pro) after adding a new virtual
domain to it.

And now I only get a http403 error. I can't access any of the domains,
or the WBA..

Anyone now how to solve this....?

I've had a different problem which may have a similar cause.


One of my perl cgi programs serves multiple responses against extra path
info in the url.
Responses are all html pages. All output is as expected, I have no
problems.

Except for one response which is multiple-framed:
  One frameset / 3 frames
  Javascript - no errors known to me.
  No html code errors known to me.
  No html code framesetting errors known to me.
  Html output varies - have 15 different frameset content for same
frameset scheme.
  Minimum total frameset content 11 Kb  / maximum total frameset content
73 Kb.


Problem:
--------
- The third frame locks Xitami up - regardless of content served,
- corrupts any files ( db temp lockfiles ) being written by the
  cgi program ( it executes ) during the lockup and
- crashes the computer.
Db is simple text files - no engine - no server.


Logfiles show
-------------
- Three successive requests - one frameset, two frames. Fourth request
not there.
- Request order of frames varies and is identical in requests both from
Netscape and  Explorer.
- Different content has different frame request order.
- Both browsers trigger the crash.


So that
-------
- A different page is being served during each crash,
- a different frame of the set is being served during each crash,
- the html/Js content served is different during each crash,
- the file size being requested is different during each crash,
- and a different browser is making the request at each crash.


The only thing I have found to be in common is the fact that a third
frame is being requested.

It's difficult to reproduce the environment unless I give a few hours of
time, because I changed the third frame to a Js write from the frameset
<head> content and solved the problem for good. However, I am upset not
being able to serve a third frame from a cgi program.

I use Windows 98 on a Pentium II 64 Mb Ram and Xitami 2.4d6 to serve an
introvert website. No workload - mostly testing.

I solved it !! (tried a lot of things)

I removed the "webmask" section from the "default.cfg" file... 

The * sign (exclude all) somehow got on a single line and excluded
everybody including myself.

I had put the * sign at the end of an IP address to exclude a series of
IP's.. but when I restarted the server the line was automatic cut and
the * was placed on the last line alone. Xitami read this as "exclude
all" and effectivly shut the server down....

Is there anyway to make a user re-enter their Username and Password after

Hi,

	I'm running Xitami and a Win 2000 box.  I'm very curious to know how long 
each request to this server takes, as all requests end up causing large DB 
searches. So, I switched the log file format to Xitami Extended LML, where 
there's a 'Duration' field.  This, however, never reports anything...   Is 
there any way for me to see how long each request is taking, from the 
moment the server get's it, to the moment it responds?

Thanks!

Ewen,

We use LRWP and sometimes experience similar problems.  I also noticed that
sometimes Xitami leaves a temporary file behind.
If there might be a bug in the way Xitami handles temporary files, how can
we avoid using them?
Perhaps by explicitly providing Content-Size using a CGI hint?
Instead of using temporary files, can Xitami be configured to store content
in memory?
How can I learn more about the way Xitami uses temporary files and generates
temporary file names?
Thank You,

Dmitry

The results are incorrect as well (that is, the logs reflect what is
returned to the client and vice versa).  Xitami isn't dropping data being
sent back to the client.

I can modify the DAS for localhost use only and send you the DAS and DAC
along with the CFM, PHP, and Perl scripts (Nuclear Vision scripts would be
semi-worthless since the executable hasn't been released yet).  The DAC
isn't 100% bug-free yet (but it is close - I just pinpointed one very
elusive bug that took forever to figure out what was going on), but the DAS
should be able to withstand anything thrown at it.  Ewen, let me know if
you want a localhost version for testing Xitami.

>If anyone else has seen anything similar and/or has any hints about what

My best guess is that there could be an OS limit on the number of processes
Xitami is allowed to start.  If that is the case, it is somewhere around
100 (50 * 2) processes (XiFusion creates a process for the CFML
executable).  I'm wondering if the NT service process limit has anything to
do with this.  I would generally think processes started by services would
be separated from the service, but they could be counted as service
processes (I think 128 service processes is the default limit).  If this is
the case, a DoS/DDoS attack could easily be created to cause about 90% of
connections to Xitami servers to fail.

If a service process limit is the problem, the solution is to track if
starting the process failed, and if it did, wait a bit (.25 seconds -
controllable from the configuration files) and then try again.  If it can't
create the process for 30 seconds, then kill the client connection with a
response that the server is overloaded.

This might have something to do with CGIs, but the issue I am addressing is
the issue with load-testing Xitami (which, at the moment, appears to fail
and might even be a DoS/DDoS issue).

Hi,

I want two web server running on one computer. The first 
one should be xitami on port 80 listening to all IP 
addreses. The second one is a zope server running on port 
8080 only listening to 127.0.0.1 (localhost). If there is 
a request for the zope server (maybe 
http:/my.xitami.server/my-zope-server from the internet 
the xitami server should take this request, should ask the 
zope server for content and should give the content back

Doesn't help me, I just thought some wiser person would know the
limits. You later suggested 128 processes which is in the
ballpark  with your observed 100 process choke-point. I don't
know the limits, but since much NT core comes from OS/2 which is
pushing 2 decades old, but MS has had fingers in it, those
numbers are not implausible. 

Just tossing off dumb ideas....

How many files are open when you choke? Aside from your program
and data files, there may be temporary files. NT seems to handle
large numbers of live files, but I've never known the limits. 

Can you test with Xitami as a non-Service process? I don't know
if that changes anything.

Can you test on a unix platform known to have larger (or at least
very different) limits on processes? Even if your spawn processes
are not available on unix, any non-trivial filter program using
similar resources (processes, file-handles) ought to suggest if
it is the O/S or Xitami.

Can you test under Apache? If it is indeed something in Xitami,
Apache should choke differently.

	I think you need Persistent CGI, or PCGI. Zope ships with one that works with
Apache/UNIX. maybe other platforms too.

All,

OK, I don't know where to begin with this one. I have a web page at
http://lllama.dynhost.com/. I have Xitami v2.5b5 on Win98. It looks fine
when viewed with Netscape (any version) and IE (any version) on my PC and
Mac.

I recently started using Opera 6.01. (Boy, is it great, but that's another
story.) When I view my home page in Opera, there is a problem. The page
usually (90% of the time) stalls when downloading, and only some of the
graphics appear. Some of the graphics display wrong - one graphic file
appears where another should. Hitting Refresh in the browser doesn't improve
things.

I assumed that my HTML was wrong, so I copied the files to my local drive
(in preparation to edit them), and to my surprise, Opera works fine with the
web page/graphics then. So THEN I turned off Xitami and ran SimpleServer,
and then Apache, and guess what: Opera sees the page just fine when I use
these other servers.

So, does ANYONE here know what is going on, and how to fix it?

On one of my machines I'm running Xitami under Windows 2000, and use Opera 
6.00 or 6.01 to mange the machine, from that machine.  I've had no problems.

I can tell you that 6.01 has a serious denial of service problem that was 
not in 6.00.  I filled a bug report over a week ago and have heard nothing 
from the opera people.  I would use 6.00, I would not use 6.01.

It stalls for here on Opera 6.0 build 1010 exactly on or before your 
icq.gif displays.  Opera has some problems with certain java.  Try 
eliminating your counter code or other sections just above the 
icq.gif to see if that suddenly clears things up.

Let's not lose sight of the fact that this EXACT page

It loads so fast locally would a stall be so obvious?

Perhaps it is having a hard time loading a specific image because it 
chokes trying to decode it.  You might have an image format Opera 
struggles with.  Images can contain a multitude of sins.  

Could be java.  Could be loading an offsite image via java.  It sure 
isn't Xitami.

By process of elimination the culprit will quickly emerge.  Start 
clean and re-insert html code until Opera chokes.  Bingo.  

As a truism, all the software I write works great locally.  It's only my 
customers who have problems.

There is NO stall when Apache or SimpleServer is the server instead of
Xitami. Images are NOT switched around when Apache or SimpleServer is the
server instead of Xitami.

I think people keep missing this when I write it.

Hello Warren,

It  is  a  problem of OPERA, not of XITAMI. It arises when the page is
loaded not completely. If the reload does not help, clean the cache.

P.S.Insert <!DOCTYPE > string in page & check your page in W3C.

This isn't "rewriting" so much as "proxying".  Not that it matters too
much in this instance -- Xitami doesn't support doing either at present.
You could probably write a LRWP program to do something like this if you
wanted.  (Webservers like Apache support both URL rewriting and proxying
like you mention.)

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami, PHP and aliases
Message-ID: <a74svh.3vvk2nh.1@hoplaa.oojaa>

Hi!

I've been trying to learn some PHP lately and for that reason I got
myself Xitami (version 2.4d9) and PHP 4. Everything went just fine,
until I discovered the possibility of aliases :-) Instead of putting
everything in the (default) folder called "webpages", I thought it was
a good idea to also make folders called "webpages2" and "webpages3" for
my different PHP learning projects.
I set the aliases according to the manual. In my case it means:

[alias]
cats=E:\xitami\webpages2
dogs=E:\xitami\webpages3

The URL for cats would be:
http://localhost/cats/index.php

Only, it does not work. The browser (Opera/Netscape/IE) acts like it's
connecting, but only shows a blank page. With HTML everything works:
http://localhost/cats/index.html
opens fine. And yes, all those files do exist (I have the same files
both in PHP and HTML). I've read the manual and gone through FAQ.
So, how to get PHP and aliases work together? I have Windows 95, if it
means anything.

TIA,

[alias]
cats=E:\xitami\webpages2
dogs=E:\xitami\webpages3

Aliases are sometimes helpful for simplifying URLs to static pages.

They do NOT work well for anything complicated. In this case, Xitami
knows that cats=webpages2, but PHP does not know that. There are
workarounds for some situations, but that may be too complicated or
just more trouble than is worth for your situation.

For your situation, why not just rename the webpages2 folder to
"cats"?

OS/2 at the time when Microsoft had their dirty fingers in it might have
had such a limitation; since BillyG threw his toys out of the pram, and
IBM continued alone with OS/2 v2 (and later Warp v3 and v4, and nowadays
v4.52; not to mention eComStation) there's been nothing like any such
limitation in OS/2.  I have seen people speak of running THOUSANDS of
threads, in many hundreds of processes, without any problems, in OS/2.

There again, if such a limitation existed in early OS/2 code (when M$
were still on-board), it may well have been carried through into WinNT
and Win2K.

Which is the only OS that supports SMP with up to 64 processors on the
x86 family?  It's not Linux; neither is it Windoze.

Hello,

I have a web-based application that I use for our employees to do their daily work.  
Whenever they make an entry, I use the REMOTE_USER variable to capture which 
employee is doing the work.  Up until March 5, this was working fine.  However, on 
March 5th I created an SSL certificate (private) and issued it to everyone so 
everyone would be logging in via HTTPS.  Now the REMOTE_USER field is always 
coming up as -

Configuration notes - 

I have the directory aliased.

They type in http://www.yourplace.org/db

That takes them to c:\xitami\webpages\db.shtml

which in turn redirects them to https://www.yourplace.org/cgi-bin/db/index.shtml

/cgi-bin/db/ is a protected directory so it prompts them for their user name and 
password

once entered, all of the URL's they access are in the protected directory


So my question, summarized, is, why is the REMOTE_USER information getting lost 
since I switched to SSL and how do I get it back because it's incredibly critical to our 
daily operations?

Still the best way to work around this is to use name based virtual hosts. You may want to take a look into the manual on how to set them up.

The problem is that Xitami doesn't pass PHP the translated ("real") path to the files in the alias-dir but the alias path. Of course this cannot work as PHP doesn't know of the servers alias handling.

    During install it should ask you for the server type, you choose Xitami,
it will enable PHP for you. All you have to do is click the dialogs.

FB> handling.

It not absolutely so.

EXPERIMENT:

1). Lets create two aliases.

defaults.cfg

         [Alias]
             Alias1=%ALIAS_PATH%\page1.php
             Alias2=%ALIAS_PATH%

2). Lets make three files.

 - test.php
 - %ALIAS_PATH%\text.txt
 - %ALIAS_PATH%\page1.php

test.php

         <HTML>
          <HEAD>
           <TITLE> READ FILE FROM ALIAS PATH </TITLE>
          <HEAD>
          <BODY>
           <CENTER>
           <?php
             als_file=fopen("http://myhost/alias/text.txt","r");
             fpassthru(als_file);
             print("\n");
           ?>
           <hr>
           <As you can see a path is converted correctly.>
           </CENTER>
          </BODY>
         </HTML>

%ALIAS_PATH%\text.text

         <B>I am a test file with alias path.<B>

%ALIAS_PATH%\page1.php

         <HTML>
          <HEAD>
           <TITLE>PHP SCRIPT WITH ALIAS PATH</TITLE>
          <HEAD>
          <BODY>
           <?php
             print("<CENTER><B>I am a php script with alias path.</B></CENTER>/n");
           ?>
          </BODY>
         </HTML>

3).     .

RUN http://myhost/test.php

         <HTML>
          <HEAD>
           <TITLE> READ FILE FROM ALIAS PATH </TITLE>
          <HEAD>
          <BODY>
           <CENTER>
         <B>I am a test file with alias path.<B>
         
           <hr>
           <As you can see a path is converted correctly.>
           </CENTER>
          </BODY>
         </HTML>

RUN http://myhost/alias1

         <HTML>
          <HEAD>
           <TITLE>PHP SCRIPT WITH ALIAS PATH</TITLE>
          <HEAD>
          <BODY>
           <?php
             print("<CENTER><B>I am a php script with alias path.</B></CENTER>/n");
           ?>
          </BODY>
         </HTML>

RUN http://myhost/alias2/page1.php !!!!!!!!!!!!!

         <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
         <HTML><HEAD>
         <META content="text/html; charset=windows-1251" http-equiv=Content-Type></HEAD>

on.  I want to get an old system just to host a website, but want to be
sure it will handle it.  I'm thinking about a pentium 233 with 128 MB RAM.
 Let me know what processor, RAM, hard drive, ...etc you have.  Also, how
many hits per day does it handle without slowing down, crashing, etc.

That sounds like plenty of horsepower.  I am planning to move mine to a
Celeron 300A with a spare stick of 256 under win 2000.  

Right now I have it running on my home workstation.

dual PIII 700's @ 1054 each, 512 megs of ram.  win 2000

I don't have a lot of hits per day though.  It's just a couple of personal
sites. 
www.four-banger.net and www.mrhymbaugh.com

I have recently developed a problem where I have to restart xitami every
morning because no one can get to the sites.  The X icon will be down in the
corner and if I move my mouse close to it, it goes away.

If you are planning on hosting mainly static pages the machine you are 
thinking of is sufficiently fast that your bottleneck will be the 
internet not your machine.

If you are planning on more dynamic content (i.e. CGIs perl etc) then 
your mileage will vary based on the efficiency of your dynamic content 
and how many hits are CGI vs static, but if you dedicate the machine to 
being a webserver (no mail,ftp...) then this should be quite OK for a 
site that is connected to the internet by something less than say a 
10Mbps ethernet pipe. Personally I have  run a small website including 
perl CGIs on an ancient 75Mhz pentium with 32MB memory and win95 OSR2. 
As long as it wasn't doing ANYTHING except Xitami/perl that was fine but 
it got a bit bogged down as soon as I tried to run another app.

You're not telling us what type of load you expect, if you want to 
run PHP as a CGI module, etc. This is very important information.

>  Let me know what processor, RAM, hard drive, ...etc you have. 

200MHz MMX, 96 MB RAM, cheap-o Fujitsu IDE drive, Tyan Titan Turbo 
motherboard, running NT 4 Workstation with Xitami webserver and 
Mercury/32 mailserver. Xitami and Mercury/32 takes up VERY little 
RAM. Right now, with an uptime of ten days, the total system uses 38 
MB of physical RAM.
PHP (CGI mode) is kind of slow. Compare my personal site
http://mw.9000.org/
(which uses PHP) with a HTML-only site
http://www.brandkonsulten.se/
Those two are hosted at the same machine. Initial lag for PHP parsing 
is quite noticeable.

> Also, how
> many hits per day does it handle without slowing down, crashing, etc.

This I haven't tested. It never crashes. I have had months/years of 
uptime depending on the mail server and me installing stuff. Then, 
the websites don't see very much use, only the mail server. But I 
don't think Xitami has ever crashed -- if you avoid the beta version, 
that is...

I have it on a P500Mhz with 128 Ram and win2000proSP1.
The same machine has also mail server(merak), firewall(winroute pro),
webmail(merak), ftp(xitami), WAP(merak)
I have less than 300 hits a day on http.
Less than 10/day WAP.
About 60 / week FTP.
28 are sharing the internet connection thru this computer.
About 50 e-mail clients connect every 10-30 minutes(pop/smtp).
(8.00am-7.00pm). Less during the night.
And everithing goes fine, not one single crash since 21/NOV/2001 and it's on
24h/day.
And i do my ouw cgi in delphi and they work fine.
Xitami is one great product. But it should have WAP support.

Thanks for all the input so far.  I guess I left off some information.  I
plan on running W2K pro on this machine.  There will be PHP as CGI and
possibly an FTP server as well (not xitami).  I don't expect a ton of hits
per day (< 20).  I suppose a mail server is always possible down the road.
 I'm also thinking about using this PC as a central server on a home
network at the same time.  The main use will be to store a buttload of
mp3s that will be accessable on any PC in the house.  Thanks for the
feedback.

Pentiums? DUAL Pentiums?

I got into Xitami because it runs WELL (serving static pages) on a
386SX-16 with 4 Megs RAM. Inside the building I could just tell the
difference between that throw-away 386 and a Pentium running PWS.
Outside the building, most users said it was faster than most large
servers.

If you have forgotten how slow a 386SX-16 is... NetScape 3.0 took
over a minute to load a very simple page of HTML. It was an awful
machine for browsing, but a fine server.

Xitami isn't the issue.

CGI/filters can be. Until last September I was running a university
departmental site on a P-133, 32 Megs memory, filtering most pages
through a Visual Basic filter, and speed was not an issue. I don't
have a total hit-count but the top page got 50,000 hits in 3 years,
and typical visitors hit 10 pages with several to many images per
page, or thousands of files delivered per day. And it stood up fine
to the initial onslaught of CodeRed, hundreds of stupid hits per
hour.

How do you do that?
Since webmail (IceWarp i suppose) is also a webserver, does it not 
interfere with the real one?
Can i for instance use port 220 (not used on our LAN) for webmail and use 
address <http://xxx.yyy.com:220>?

My current server is a AMD K6-2 366Mhz (was 333) with 62MB ram and 40GB WD
IDE ATA66 hard drive, before I cannibalized it and rebuilt it, it was a HP
Pavilion 4440. I'm running WinXP Pro with M-Daemon Mail Server, GuildFTPd
and VNC. After two weeks of uptime I didn't notice a bit of slow down with
the system nor did Xitami take up more than 2MB of physical memory (system
floats around 46 - 54).

PHP and MySQL is very fast on the system, pages load almost instantly over
the LAN. Hosts person websites for now. http://dewdude.ath.cx

I had it on a Win98SE machine on Pentium 200 with 32MB RAM (a Compaq
Presario 4504) and it ran decently.

Message-ID: <3C98DEF2.1090505@freesbee.fr>

This *MAY* be related to the CGI problem reported last week.

I can repeatably get a Xitami server to crash when I hit it continuously 
with WGET running at max and hitting an XML page that runs a GSL script. 
If anyone (Ewen?) is interested in the code I can provide it.

The GSL code basically opens a specific second file, parses it and 
returns a specific text block in a webpage, with the exact file and text 
block depending on the query section of the URL. Each page is on average 
a little under 2KB and until it crashes Xitami is serving up a steady 35 
pages a second which isn't bad considering all the work that has ot be done.

After a few minutes of doing this xitami either stops responding or 
actually crashes. In neither case does anything go into the log file. 
Runing Xitami on a Win2k SP2+ pro machine with 256Mb memory and 1.5Ghz P4.

I have a little old P133 with about 96 megs of ram and a pair of 2 gig
drives running Win98. This pathetic pizza-box machine built with cast off
parts has been running non-stop for two years with various Linuxes and
Windows before settling on Win98 now. It runs Xitami, PHP, a mail server, an
FTP server, a remote access server, plus it acts as a shared drive for my
lan and a laser printer server. It also used to be my firewall for my LAN
before I got a Linksys DSL Router. I restart it once every 40 days or so
just because it feels good. It runs no foreground applications.

I get no more than 15 unique web page visitors a day, but it deals with
thousands of emails a week no sweat. SOME complicated PHP applications seem
to take too long, but other complicated PHP applications blast through
rather quickly - I need to figure out why that is.

Hope this helps,
Warr

Xitami is hardly an issue in this case. You will however find W2K a
hair pokey at the console. I just put XP on a K6/2-400 as an
experiment, and it don't stink (after I got more than 64M RAM in it)
but it isn't a machine I'd fly every day after being spoiled by a
Celeron 1Gig. I ran W2K on P-200 for a short time and it didn't stink,
just not as snappy as newer CPUs.

But I've run Xitami on 386SX-16 and 486-33. Installation seemed to
take forever on the 386, and slogging around NT4 on a souped-up 486
demands calm patience, but Xitami flew fine and fast.

The MP3 files should not be an issue unless you use a bloated MP3
server. Audio rates are no problem for modern networks or a P-233.

My mail server runs on PPro-233 and everything is "instant", but the
traffic there is too small to be a real test.

I say just do it. By the time you get enough CGI and other frills
loaded on to make any load worth frettting about, GigaHertz PCs will
be in trashbins looking for good homes.

Hello.
Adding WAP support is that easy, add these lines to [Mime] section of
defaults.cfg:

     Wbmp=image/vnd.wap.wbmp
     Wml=text/vnd.wap.wml
     Wmlc=application/vnd.wap.wmlc
     Wmls=text/vnd.wap.wmlscript
     Wmlsc=application/vnd.wap.wmlscriptc

That should be enough.

That's the case, webmail runs on diferent port.
To simplify things for the user i just added a link on main site, like this
they don't have to type ":port".

I know this is not xitami related, but with webmail you can also run WAP,
for mail, and even build a site on it. Just add /wap/ after the port number.
Ex.: Web site -> www.mysite.com
       Webmail -> www.mysite.com:4096
       WAP      -> www.mysite.com:4096/wap/
I would like to have Wap with xitami. Like this i couls leave my mail server
just for mail.
I hope someone at Xitami is reading this :)

Well it works in SUB-DIRECTORIES of the webpages folder too I believe. 
so you can have
\xitami\webpages\dogs\index.php and \xitami\webpages\cats\index.php 
which are retrived by
http://computer/dogs/index.php and http://computer/cats/index.php

 From your description of what you want that should be OK - no?

'webpages' ... being any folder you declare to be webpages. PHP files will work in any folder under that too.

Anyone know if where a program/browser is available for win to simulate
a slow internet connection so you could see how (without lag or delay) a
page would load up?  I know you can take the file size and calculate it
or use fontpage built in calculator but some things you can't calculate.
Database displaying retrieved information,  flash etc...

Thank you

There is in Xitami a 'bandwidth throttle' that you can set in defaults.cfg.
(Haven't tried it yet)

Also, HomeSite (www.macromedia.com) will calculate for you how
many seconds a page(s) will take to load at various speeds.

Put the files on a floppy disk, and point your browser at it.

That's not an exact measurement. But if it sucks from floppy, it
will suck on modem.

You can still get free dial-up internet access from from netzero
(www.netzero.com) and you can see for yourself that way.  If you do a search
for hayes compatible modem commands, you can learn the terminal commands to
limit the speed of your modem to say . . . 28800 or something. (I forget
what the command is)

Uh thanks... This would also be separate from Xitami at times so I could
send it to customers who are working on their own sites to see how quick
it loads up.

This isn't a bad "first cut" metric.  Floppy drives tend to get
30-50KB/second, which is roughly equivilent to a slow ADSL or cable modem 
link (say, one up to 512Kbps).  

You need to make sure the floppy isn't cached though; so write them to
floppy on one machine, and then test it on another one, to be sure.

As someone else mentioned there is some traffic shaping code in the
Xitami 2.5 beta that you could try.  Some operating systems, such as
FreeBSD (and IIRC recent Linux kernels) also have traffic shaping code.
A friend of mine used the FreeBSD traffic shaping to test one large
website for "modem speed" to good effect.

Don't forget the KISS solution -- grab a PC with a modem, dial out to
the Internet, and then try it :-)  (This is also useful for checking
that you didn't accidentally include any links that only work
internally.)

Message-ID: <C0B72BFE4E6CFF4C97FDB17BED66E84AF644AC@cceexc15.americas.cpqcorp.net>

I'm new to PHP.  I downloaded the PostNuke - PHP based - forum package and put it where the server
can find it.  I tried running the install.php and I get past the first two screens but it can't get to the 3rd
because of a 500 - Internal Server error.  Looking at the logs, nothing PHP related jumps out at me.  I
configured PHP to log errors and still get nothing.

I'm running the beta.  I downloaded the newest beta and retried with the same results.

I checked the Xitami FAQ and there's nothing there about PHP.

It may be something dead-simple, but I'm not seeing it.  Can anyone more experienced give me a 
pointer or two?

ok people... i must really be stupid because i am really having a tough time
figuring this out. the answers i've been given sound really simple. so can
some one give me some specifics...

problem - i have and intranet for the company. currently it is open to the
internet. i want all employees to be able to access it. the problem is that
i want to restrict public access to the site by using passwords. people in
the office should be able to access the site as normal (no password prompt),
but people accessing it from the internet should be prompted before access
is given.i would like to have people access the site using the same
urlregardless of their location.

the webmask command seems to only lock out ip ranges.... i want to set
certain ip ranges to be (or not be) prompted for passwords.

the solution i was given was to use 2 aliases - both point to the same data.
one protected by a webmask the other protected by passwords. i think this
would work - but then people would need to remember 2 urls... one for inside
and one for outside - right? and they would have to know which one to use
and when... (intranet.domain.com/public   intranet.domain.com/private)

the other solution i've come up with is duplicate the intranet webserver.
one inside the network and one out in the DMZ. that way 1 url, and the
correct dns entries... but i would have to make sure i kept both sites
identical and i would need another pc.

any more ideas or help?

set up a vhost to the intranet ip or intranet host name to point to the
intranet site....then go to the xitami directory, you should see .cfg and
.aut files for the stuff you just created...you can then manually edit the
vhost's .aut (usually the name you gave when you configured it, so if you
made it use local.cfg..you'd edit local.aut) and it's really simple..you can
look at aut files....or in the webadmin..change defualts.aut to whatever the
filename is and edit that way.

Russell,

What kind of server are you trying to do this on?
NT, Linux, etc.
Memory?
HD?
etc?

If you are running this on an old and slow Windows machine, then you will
find that it will not work well, if at all.  Let me know what you are
running and we can take it from there.

Configure two virtual hosts.  Configure one accessible from anywhere,
and one accessible only from the Intranet (by IP address ranges).  For
the one accessible from anywhere, configure it to require a password for
access.

Then tell the Intranet people to use the internal host name, and the
others to use the external host name.

yes - but then i have 2 names that people must use. many are sales and
support people that are in the office some times and on the road sometimes.
i would like to not have them need to remember 2 names and which name to use
when....

right now i'm leaning towards the alias thing. the default page
(intranet.domain.com) could remind them of the 2 links and allow them to
select the correct one (intranet.domain.com/private   or
intranet.domain.com/public)

basically my question is - is there a way around this 2-name problem?

Hi,

You could have only one, unique URL which points to a CGI (could be
anything, console application, LRWP-based, etc) which looks at the IP of the
user and then routes the request through the CGI response which is a
dynamically generated temporary page with a refresh of 1 second pointing to
the to the appropriate URL (either public or private).
I hope this helps.

I thought you named two different groups of people?
Do the same individuals move freely between the two groups?
Can they not bookmark the URL's ?

yes - most individuals switch on a day-to-day basis. hence the want for a
single url.

yes they can bookmark it... but you guys know how users are... i'm trying to
make this as simple as possible for them  ;-)

Stefan is on the right track.  Redirecting by ip is easy esp when you 
are willing to use cgi and ssi.   There's no need for any time lapse 
or refresh.

Just create a simple script to redirect based upon ip.  You can 
easily redirect those outside the intranet one direction and those 
inside the intranet another direction.

I've done this a many times over the years.  I keep an example at 
http://alft.net/software/ip2block/  Obviously you create your own to 
do whatever you want.

One of the things I *really* like about (windows) Xitami is the ability 
to use simple win32 binaries with full ssi.   After years of severe 
limitations and abuse by isp's, I have complete freedom.  Xitami 
just fell out of the blue sky and blessed my computer.  Praise be!

You can also do it using Xitami's handy built-in GSL scripting tool. 
Only possible disadvantage is that your HTML docuemtns will probably 
need to have a different extension. But the different extension and the 
addition of a few script lines at the top is all you need.

For example instead of index.htm you have index.dhtm
index.dhtm has the lines like the following tagged onto the front of it

.if defined(REMOTE_USER)
.- do some other validation if you feel like it e.g. check a cookie 
contacined in HTTP_COOKIE
.  define loginOK = 1
.else
.- Assume internal network is 10.1.1.0/24
.  if (substr(REMOTE_IP,,,7) = "10.1.1.")
.    define loginOK = 1
.  endif
.endif
.if (! defined(loginOK))
  Need to Login</TITLE>
  <meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; 
URL=http://$(HTTP_HOST:lower)/cgi-bin/ra/login.pl?referer=$(path_info)$(wasloggedin?:)"></HEAD>
  <BODY></BODY></HTML>
.  abort
.endif
<!-- start of  regular page -->

This is actually a Mercury setup problem not Xitami, but since i'm also 
using mercury:

Goto Configuration, Core Module and change the name of the primary domain 
(tab general, internet name for this system).
Don't forget to enter all other domain names in Local domains, or the 
server will try to mail out messages destined for some local domain names 
and refuse some incoming mails.

Most important: UNCHECK "VALIDATION OF FROM FIELD WHEN PROCESSING MAIL" in 
Config, Core module, General.


You can also change your UA (user agent, that is your mail program) to use 
a different account whith the short domain name.
Normally mercury won't change From fields.
Mail me if you still have problems using Mercury: <marc@verfaillie.com>

Ok, not that I know Jack about anything to do with webservers, or

arent there environment variables in perl or php (an probably other types of) 
code that you could use to detect and set a cgi in motion for different 
connections (intranet / vs internet)?  What those variables are and how to 
use them I havent got a clue!  But I figure if youre running your companies

Big subject.  Depending on your point of view, using cgi, ssi and 
passing variables can be harder than doing a tax return  ;P  or 
more fun than doing a NYTimes crossword puzzle.

If you want simple, all-purpose perl scripts to plug in, searches 
using keywords "redirect ip cgi" came up with a few.  Some scripts 
are free.

I found the Xitami local help and online documentation do an 
excellent job ~ but assumes you understand the basics of cgi.  All 
the standard variables are explained.

    I think you're coming at this from a very difficult point of view.
You're trying to learn how a 'specific' application handles a situation with
out first understanding how 'any' application in general works.  Its great
to start the learning process, and Xiami is as good a place to begin as any,
but you need to learn the basic first before worrying about the specifics.
Get some good books on how Internet servers work, especially HTTP (i.e. Web
servers) and on CGI.  Once you understand these things, then learn how to
use your specific tool to implement them.

Hello all,

Looking for someone who knows the basic steps for setting up PHP with
Xitami.
Thanks.

So far all I've done is add this defaults.cfg
[Filter]
    .php="c:\php\php.exe"       

This is the file I'm using to test:

<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>

        <?php 
        echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"; 
        ?>

    </body>
</html>

	This question comes up again and again, when in fact the PHP "InstallShield"
will automatically configure Xitami for PHP.

	So, I am not even sure why people try to manually configure it. Maybe because
they try to get the PHP zip instead of the "InstallShield" ?

	Frankly, all you need to do is keep clicking the Dialog for the PHP install.
The only gotcha now with the latest PHP is that you must edit php.ini and
re-enable PHP for standard CGI, they disabled that in the pre-configured files
for security reasons.

I am including my default.cfg

Xitami uses two files xitami.cfg for main configuration and any differences
will go into the default.cfg

I think the reason is that you can create multiple configurations without
copying the whole thing.

make sure php is working.  Go to your command line and type 

php -v

that should show you the version.

That should be it.

All you need then is go to your /xitami/webpages directory
and put your test.php file(remember to put .php)

Hello all,

Looking for someone who knows the basic steps for setting up PHP with
Xitami.
Thanks.

So far all I've done is add this defaults.cfg
[Filter]
    .php="c:\php\php.exe"       

This is the file I'm using to test:

<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>

        <?php 
        echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!";

Subject: [Xitami] Newbie question: Xitami and php
Message-ID: <112840722.20020328193416@hetnet.nl>

I have Xitami up and running on Windows 98 SE.
I've installed the latest distribution of php4.
Now, whenever I open a php-file (like phpinfo.php)
in my browser on the localhost-adress I receive the following message:

"Security Alert! PHP CGI cannot be accessed directly.
This PHP CGI binary was compiled with force-cgi-redirect enabled.
This means that a page will only be served up if the REDIRECT_STATUS CGI variable
is set. This variable is set, for example, by Apache's Action directive redirect. 
You may disable this restriction by recompiling the PHP binary with
the --disable-force-cgi-redirect switch. If you do this and you have your
PHP CGI binary accessible somewhere in your web tree, people will be able to
circumvent .htaccess security by loading files through the PHP parser.
A good way around this is to define doc_root in your php.ini file to something other
than your top-level DOCUMENT_ROOT. This way you can separate the part of your web space
which uses PHP from the normal part using .htaccess security. If you do not have
any .htaccess restrictions anywhere on your site you can leave doc_root undefined.
If you are running IIS, you may safely set cgi.force_redirect=0 in
php.ini."

I tried everything, but I can't get it to work, and an internet- and
faq-search didn't make me any wiser.
Can someone explain me in plain and simple English which steps I have
to take to solve this?

Thanks in advance, Edward

	go to php.ini (c:\winnt\php.ini) and add this:

force-cgi-redirect=0


This is from memory, I would have to double-check on my Xitami/PHP machine,
which I can't do right now.

I just got the same error, however, if we add that line to the php.ini file
won't we be opening ourselves up to security risks?  And in fact, I added
that line already but I am still getting the security error.

Ok, i finally got php to work.  However I want to use the doc_root =

installed into a particular directory and can only be run from there.  =
This will remove all PHP files from the /webpages directories hence =
removing potential security risks.

However, I am running virutal domains and I want each domain to have its =
own php directory, similiar to each domain having its own cgi-bin =
directory.  How can I set up the doc_root variable in PHP.INI to reflect =
that.

EX:
/xitami/domain1/htdocs
/xitami/domain1/cgi-bin
/xitami/domain1/php

/xitami/domain2/htdocs
/xtiami/domain2/cgi-bin
/xitami/domain2/php

etc, etc, etc.
The doc_root variable needs to be able to understand different =
paths....is there a universal command I could use such as *./php or =
%path%/php ???

Subject: [Xitami] LRWP
Message-ID: <00de01c1d6f0$ca6a1710$dd31200a@JAZZ>

Hi, I've been developing a LRWP interface in ruby.  Glancing over the protocol
specs, it seems like LRWP is unable to support multiple requests at the same
time.  What I mean is that you must reply back to a request before handling the
next request.  This is different from fastcgi, where you can immediately go to
the next request (even while processing the current request).

Is my assumption correct?  Any suggestions?  Perhaps fastcgi is my only choice?

Thanks,

One request per connection, at a time.  If you need to handle multiple
requests at once just open multiple connections.  If there is more than
one LRWP of the same "name" connected, then they'll be given the
requests in either round-robin or first-free fashion (depending on the
configuration option).

	The steps for what to do is shown in a Dialog in teh PHP install, at the very
end. Install PHP again, read the DIalog carefully and you will know what to do
in the INI and what the implications are.

	You probably just clicked teh Dialog away without reading it carefully. Or
installed PHP from the ZIP instead of the "InstallShield".

	I don't run Xitami/PHP on a public machine, so I don't care. You may want to
read more about the security implications yourself. Good luck ;-)

Hi Marcio, this still doesn't work.
After changing the cgi.force to zero, I still receive the same error.
Next, I've changed the doc_root, but then I get a blank page.
That is of course one step further :)

I use phpinfo.php, containing the script:
    <?php phpinfo();?>
    
The output is a blank html-page.

>From the command line everything works fine, so it must be a matter of
configurating the php.ini or Xitami.

Do you think you can help me further?

TIA, Edward

	A fresh install of the PHP  InstallShield should configure it all right, except
the security problem.

	Then you go to c:\winnt\PHP.ini (your windows dir) and declare this:

cgi.force_redirect = 0

	and that should work. In fact, you must have this value already in the INI,
commented out. In this case it is using the default value of 1, but you want 0.

	From this point on, you're on your own.

Message-ID: <080f01c1d749$23b34460$020aa8c0@Master>

Ed:

I got this to work but there are a few catches:
1.  cgi.force_redirected = 0   ;;; make certain the ";" is removed from the
front of the line..
2.  All php files must go into the *./webpages directories for each of your
domains
3.  Pros/Cons of using the "doc_root" variable:
    CONS:
        1. #2 won't apply if you define it - ALL php files for all domains
must go into that directory, thus your files start to get jumbled together
and files for virtual domain "blah.com" will sit in the same directory for
another virtual domain "blah1.com".  There could possibly be a way around
this if you did something along the following (I haven't tested it though):
            PHP.INI: doc_root = /xitami/php
            Xitami blah1.cfg: [Alias Section] *.php = /xitami/php/blah1/
            Xitami blah2.cfg: [Alias Section] *.php = /xitami/php/blah2/

            You would have to manually created each virtual domain directory
reference in the /xitami/php directory - you would then also have to force
FTP paths so those domain admins could upload php files for their domain,
ONLY to their directory.  I think this might work.  You definently have to
jump through hoops though.

        2. By not defining the doc_root variable you could possibly open
your server to security risks.  The doc_root variable is designed to work
similar to the /cgi-bin URL call in xitami...forcing all CGIs to be in a
certain place outside of the webpages path.

    PROS:
        1. This is a security feature in PHP that allows you to remove the
php files from your accessable webpage tree path.  By default, an undefined
"doc_root" will allow the following paths to work:: /xitami/webpages/*.php,
or /xitami/webpages/php/*.php, OR  /xitami/domain1/webpages/*.php or
/xitami/domain2/webpages/scripts/*.php

A defined "doc_root" variable forces everything to that specific directory
but will prevent users from using PHP properties to scan your entire server,
outside of Xitami.

Hope this helps.
Russel

Thanks, I will try that. The security isn't really an issue, I just
want to test php-files locally.

Hi Russell,

I'll try that. First I'm gonna uninstall all php and sever-software
(I've tried different ones to get it to work). After a fresh
install I guess it must be working.

Hi,

	I don't know how many of you are familiar with mod_backhand for the apache 
server, but it allows you to have a cluster of servers with one master 
server that handles all incoming connections.  Based on how busy each 
machine is in the cluster, backhand decides if the master machine should 
handle the request, or if it should redirect the request to another machine...

	Is there anything like this available for use with Xitami on a windows 
platform??

Thanks,

All im doing is popping a navigation bar into my page using

Of course the thing doesnt want to work.  I looked in the xitami help files 
about ssi & filters and its got a bunch of stuff about ssi and perl...and of 
course, all that is greek to me.

What do I need to do to make this work?  Is it something i need to configure

kenjoy@kenjoy.com has been unsubscribed from the Xitami mailing list
because of this persistent vacation message being submitted to the
mailing list.  At present they can still resubscribe when they return;
but if it happens again they'll be banned from the mailing list.

Please folks, if you're going to configure a vacation message:
- make sure that it doesn't go to the mailing lists you are on (or 
  unsubscribe from the mailing lists when you go away, or just set them
  to "no mail" on the webpage)
- make sure that it only sends one message to each destination in a
  long period of time (eg, once a week or something)
- make very sure it doesn't respond to messages it generated itself,
  however they get back to it.

Subject: [Xitami] Questions configuring Xitami
Message-ID: <3CA5D6B7.30198.163F21E@localhost>

{ SEQ CHAPTER \h \r 1}     I run Xitami for OS/2 ( OS/2 has always run very stability for me in the past and I 
have never wanted to change from something that "worked very well" for me).  Xitami 
runs completely dedicated on it's own machine (Pentium 100 with 32 megs of ram) 
running OS/2 Warp 4.0 .  I recently upgraded my feed to a 768 SDSL net connection to 
host some original artwork.  When up and running I am expecting anywhere from 10-20+ 
simultaneous connections during normal peak usage hours.  

     I have two concerns.  One: some of those connecting will be broadband connections.  
Won't the broadband connections take the lion share of the bandwidth (being able to 
take more faster in shorter time frame) leaving the dialups with the scraps of what they 
can down feed in a bandwidth crunch?  Is there a way under Xitami or OS/2 to make 
sure everyone gets an even amount of bandwidth at peak usage (unless this is done 
normally) or throttle bandwidth per connection to a specific kb (say 8 kb) all the time?  

     My second question is I saw in the faq that EMX was limited to 40 open sockets in 
the faq.  This has been in the faq for a LONG time.  Has the newer versions of EMX 
made improvements on this?  Also is that 40 sockets per EMX application or the entire 
machine?  I'm wondering if this 40 max sockets will hit me.

     I am not opposed to running Xitami under Windows if I have to.  If possible I would 
like to stay with OS/2 as I have left it running for over a year without even so much as 
having to reset the server.  My experience with running Xitami under NT 4 was it would 
run fine for a week to a month then Xitami would suddenly stop taking connections.  But 
everything would look like it was still running fine.  However if it turns out my only option 
is to switch perhaps there are some settings that can improve reliability?

Thanks very much anyone for any information!  Gene Angel

Hi,
    My server is being flooded with cgi requests. When I have about 60
active connections, my computer crashes because Xitami is not able to
completely close all the perl windows. How can I get Xitami to send a 413
(This server cannot handle your request) or a 502 (This server is currently
overloaded - please try again later) when it has more than 5 active
connections? Thanks.

Just one more question. Redirection worked fine after a fresh install.
But if I set the doc_root (just out of curiosity, I only test my
php-files locally, so it's not a security issue), I have to define the
exact name of the php-file, before it works.
So, if I enter the path : ../../php/info.php I can open the file, but
this file alone. If I open another php-file, say test.php, my browser
gives me the output of info.php.
Did I miss a configuration option in Xitami?

Thanks for your help,
Edward

RO>             Xitami blah2.cfg: [Alias Section] *.php = /xitami/php/blah2/

RO>             You would have to manually created each virtual domain directory
