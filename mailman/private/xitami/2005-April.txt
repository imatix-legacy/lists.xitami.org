I use Xitami on a thumb drive.  I don't autorun it or anything, I insert  
the thumb drive, and then run Xitami.

I move it around the office, and use it to demo web sites that I work on  
to the folks I work for.  I don't have to worry about DNS like some others  
would, since everything is http://127.0.0.1, and all of my web pages use  
relative addressing.  Whatsmore, the computers are static IP, so I can hit  
them from somewhere else with the IP in the URL.

Works like mud, i.e. smooooooooth.  Ron, I'd be interested in your  
successes with php!

Ok I have Xitami with PHP and ZEND on my thumb drive. I went through the PHP
files and stripped out everything I didn't think I would need. MySQL is a
different story, I think MySQL will have to run off of the computer you
attach the thumb drive too. Because I never got anyone to tell me what the
minimum install was for it. By the way I told PHP to put the session data on
c:\temp\ which might be a good idea for the Xitami log files as well. Unless
you want to turn off logging. Most Windows PCs have a c:\temp\ directory.

Oh yeah, my Xitami thumb drive with PHP and ZEND totals 15.9mb. It could
probably even be smaller once I tweak it a little more.

Wow, I have put one of my PHP sites on it which is using the MySQL on the PC
and it seems to be working flawlessly with 100mb left over on a 128mb
thumbdrive. Difference in speed opening the main page is .86 sec server vs
1.04 sec thumbdrive.

I'll leave it plugged in for a bit at this address
http://www.miplanet.com:8180/index.php
It will be up until my PC overheats during my antivirus check some time in
the morning which I need to fix. Might get a new processor out of this
overheating problem.

Subject: [Xitami] Using a CGI for a default web page?
Message-ID: <4254C9EF.7050702@whiteshepherd.net>

Hey all.  I need some help setting up my Xitami and I'm hoping a pro out 
there in the field may know the answer to this.   Curently I run Apache. 

My defaults index pages looks like this:
DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var index.htm index.php index.php3 
default.htm index.shtml /cgi-bin/indexer.exe

What this does is if no index.* file is found it loads the indexer.exe 
which galleries the current directory.


Under Xitami I have this:
[Server]
default1=index.html
default2=index.htm
default3=index.php
default4=index.php3
default5=default.htm
default6=index.shtml
default7=/cgi-bin/indexer.exe

However the indexer.exe is ignored.  I really need to get this working 
under Xitami as Apache is nice but to slow. :(  Is there any way I can 
load this gallery program in Xitami if the default index.* files are not 
found?  Thanks for any help!

  Gene

The defaults are webpages, they apply to all directories when the filename 
is not specified.

"If no filename is specified, look for default1 in requested directory, if 
not present look for default2, ..."

I'm not sure Xitami can handle directories.

I'm pretty sure it can't. The solution (if any) to this is probably 
to set up a filter that maps .exe to "cmd.exe /c" or something like 
that. I haven't done it in Xitami, but I vaguely recall that I did it 
in Netscape FastTrack some time back in the dark ages.

You may have to wrap it in a batch file, too (map extension .exe to 
startcmd.bat which contains
@echo off
cmd.exe /c %1
..and that should be it).

Good idea I'll give it a try.  I'll try writing a program called 
"exec.exe" I'll have the filter call.  I'll have exec.exe abort any call 
if the called exe file is not found in cgi-bin dir.  That way users 
arn't running .exe's into their home directories.  Thanks for the info 
I'll let you know how it goes!

Is there a way to restart or remotely start xitami on an XP machine?  If 
xitami crashes when Im away for several days I'd like to be able to 
either remotely start it or have something that catches the crash and 
automatically restarts it.  I have the setting selected to silently 
recover from crashes, but that seems to do nothing for me.

Presuming you run Xitami as a service. Look in the Services
MMC snap-in. For each service there is a Recovery tab,
where you can tell the OS what to do when the service fails
one way or another.
In addition, there is the sc command-line tool that comes
with XP and was part of the resource kits of the earlier
NT-based Windows versions. The name comes from "service
control", I believe. The tool lets you manage services
remotely. However, since it works via Windows networking
(as a general term) and probably RDP as well, it is not
well suited for running it outside a firewall.
And there are multiple remote desktop utilities, starting
with Windows XP built-in remote desktop. There is a free
remote-desktop client for earlier versions of Windows, like
W2K - you'll just have to dig it out of Microsoft's site.
A final not-so-elegant approach. Use pslist from the free
pstools package at www.sysinternals.com. Schedule a job
that runs every now and then and executes "pslist xitami".
If the process is running, this will show information on
it. If it is not running, pslist will say "process xitami
was not found on <computer name>". Just parse the output
and restart Xitami, if needs be.

How do I set up Xitami to run as a service?  When I run MSCONFIG, Xitami 
is checked as a startup item, but it is not listed as a service.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami using over 600 megs of ram??!
Message-ID: <4258090A.9010207@whiteshepherd.net>

Ok I've run into something else.  I did a performance tests and Xitami 
defiantly performs better under a "very heavy" hit load.  Basicly I 
loaded Xitami along side Apache and moved our forums to the IP Xitami 
was using.  The users said they did noticed a big performance boost with 
the forums running under Xitami.  We're a voulenteer non-profit who 
hosts artists for free. So with no funding source except our bleeding 
pocket we need to make do with what we have.  Based on the performance I 
decided to move the bulk of our Apache virtual hosts over to Xitami 
(about 2,000 virtual hosts moved off  of apache).   Now Apache always 
seemed to take up about 90megs of ram (using dynamic virtual hosting).  
Xitami (on our P4 2400 with 1 gig of ram) took like 5 min to load at 
which point it ate about "600megs!!" of ram and then crashed the server. 

My question, is there any way Xitami will handle this kind of setup or 
is it too big or am I doing something wrong?

I am running the Windows console version under Windows 2003 Server.
My defaults.cfg loads virtualhosts like:

www.xxxx.xxx.org=usr/xxxx.cfg  (x2000 of these)

xxxx.cfg has:
[Server]
webpages=c:\webpages\artwork\xxxx
cgi-bin=c:\server\apache2\cgi-bin
log-dir=./usr-logs


I'm also worried Xitami eating that much memory will lose it's 
performance gain that it has when handling just a few vhosts.  Can 
anyone help fill me in better on doing this better (if there is a way)?

  Thanks   Gene

Don't know that, I have just 3  virtual hosts

I left standard like this
www.xxxxxx.org ="xxxxxx.cfg"
Do you really need a separate directory to organize ?

> xxxx.cfg has:
> [Server]

I am not using cgi, so I can't comment on that, but for the rest, I used here the standard 
as well like
 [Server]
    Default1 = "xxxxx.htm"
    Default2 = "xxxxx.htm"
    Dir-script = ""
    Keep-alive = "1"
    Log-dir = "./logs/xxxxxxx"
    Webpages = "./webpages/xxxxxx"

The webpage directory is set to a relative path. I don't know if that will fix it, but 
do you have the chance to try this with say 1000 hosts ?
I know it will be a lot of work, but ....

Use xisrv.exe . The steps:
1. copy xicpl32 to your windows system dir(I run NT  \winnt\system32)
2. open the dos box, go to your xitami dir and enter "xisrv.exe -i" without the quotes. the 
parameter -i installs the service  -r or -u (check with xisrv.exe -?) will deinstall or remove 
the service. That's all and you can set than from the controll panel the start options of 
your new xitami service.

That shouldn't be the case, seeing that Apache can run PHP as a 
module instead of as a CGI (I guess you are using a PHP based forum 
as that's what most forums are made in nowadays). Apache should smoke 
Xitami, as the latter needs to start up one CGI process for every 
page request. Of course, for HTML pages and images, Xitami runs 
circles around Apache.

I have been on this list for a few years, and I have never seen 
anyone even approaching that size of hosting with Xitami. I guess no 
one knows if it's possible beause no one has done it. Anyway, I would 
never consider Xitami for a project of that size because 1) the 
server is pretty much abandoned and has no future upgrade path 2) it 
is really only good at serving static content, meaning no dynamic 
pages (on the other hand it's probably the best server there is for 
that task). I'd consider other servers.

WHOA - Xitami has no future???!!!  Meaning the iMatix group won't be further 
developing the Xitami platform?  I hope that I just read that wrong or that 
that comment is inaccurate.  Someone please tell me otherwise.  I have been 
on Xitami for nearly 6 years, been on this forum the entire time and 
ultimately depend on Xitami for hosting 35 domains - I can't even imagine 
trying, or wanting, to do this on another server.

Man, tell me it ain't so.

Look at Pieter Hintjens post from 2004-10-06. I'll quote the two most 
relevant parts:

** begin quote
"We spoke to the Apache team in 1999 and were happy to see that they 
were heading towards an architecture like ours: a portability layer, 
a bunch of protocol handlers, a fully portable server.  Today Apache 
2 is a fast, portable server and seriously: you should be using 
Apache 2 instead of Xitami unless there are specific things Xitami 
does better for you."

........

"But... Xitami as a living product... it's clearly something who's 
time has come and gone.  The need for a small, fast, portable web 
server was painfully obvious in 1997-2000, and we are proud to have 
achieved what we did.  But today it's a niche product.  

We will continue to provide updates of Xitami, we will continue to 
publish the source code.  Other people may spend the time building 
binaries and nice installers - this is no longer our job."
** end quote

The server itself has hardly been updated in, like what, -- five 
years? Spare some DOS security updates. 2.5 has been in beta for that 
time, too. That's pretty sad, as it's a very, very fine product for 
what it does that would still be viable today if the 2.5 release was 
as stable as 2.4 and ISAPI or (less attractive) NSAPI was running 
like a dream (one would then not be bound to running parsers in CGI 
mode). But Imatix won't update their server, and no one has picked up 
the fallen token -- it is, after all, open source -- which pretty 
much makes the product dead.

I'm using Xitami for many years now, and while the server itself is not updated 
anymore, i still find ways to "upgrade" it myself.
For instance, i'm able to send "Content-Encoding: gzip" files instead of 
uncompressed files. Makes a lot of difference on a slow uplink like mine when 
the filesize exceeds 100k.

At this time i'm experimenting with XMLHttpRequest to provide dynamic content 
without page refresh. That's the way to make webpages behave like normal 
desktop applications. While users are entering data in forms, validation on the 
server is performed real time (fired by an onBlur form event).

"It's not the paintbrush, it's the painter"


Abyss seems to be a fine webserver with a limited memory footprint like Xitami, 
but the pro version (needed for virtual hosts) is not free ...

Hello members,

my question is not directly related to xitami, but I would like to install sqirrell mail on my

Has someone done this in the past ?
And if so, any special hints , advice ?
Something to watch out for ?

Any suggestions welcome.

Absolutely, a ISAPI module is in the binary win32 distribution.

Hello Gene,

try to switch off the "Cache Default Pages" Switch. Maybe this is the
reason for Xitami eating up all your RAM - it puts thousands of default
pages to RAM. 
Turning off makes the server a little bit slower but I think makes more
stable.

Hi there,

I have tried it. Unfortunately I was unsuccesful.
This is wat I did:
My OS is NT4 workstation.
Xitami version v2.4d9
I installed PHP. Not the newest version but an older one: 4.2.3. This
according to information obtained from the Squirrel Mail site.
I made sure this was in the php.ini file:
cgi.force_redirect = 0
cgi.redirect_status_env = CGI_REDIRECT_STATUS;
I added the following lines in the Xitami file defaults.cfg:
[Cgi-environment]
    Cgi_redirect_status=-

The only thing that did not work was the redirection in PHP under Xitami.
I posted this in the Xitami list as well but there was no usefull answer.
If you can make it to work, please inform me how you did this.
The entries in the php.ini and defaults.cfg were the result of email
correspondence about Squirrelmail and PHP under Xitami.

Best regards,

Fokke Nauta

I use 1cis mail server which works pretty good for me and it's easy to use,
It's not free but it's not expensive either. www.1cis.com about $60 per
domain.

For some reason it handles perl pages MUCH faster in Xitami than 
apache.  Becouse of memory usage I am going to stick to apache for just 
our Forums and leave it at that for now.  It's roughly 1 meg size will 
work nicely for that and the speed boost.  Though something I've pointed 
out before.  I can't use any Xitami version greater than 2.4d9 .  The 
reason behind this is any version greater than that causes partial page 
loads to about 6% of my user base (that's a lot of users on my end).  It 
works fine for everyone else, but always fails for these same 
individuals no matter how often thay reload.  I hae no tbeen able to 
track down a common cause as of yet.

No, that was my complaint ;-) There is some ISAPI support in the 2.5 
beta, but I haven't tested said support -- I didn't find 2.5 stable 
enough for my use when I tested it.

Check that the correct mime types are defined in the config files 
(default.cfg).
Normally pdf should be present in xitami.cfg
If the mime types are not present, add them in default.cfg and restart the

Johannes,

I'm curious.  You have Mercury Server running.

Mercury installed with no pain.  I've been playing with it a little and have
been able to get the php mail function work with it.

So what's the advantage to Squirrel Mail?

Near as I can tell all Squirrel Mail is, is Web Mail. Doesn't look like it's
an actual mail server. 1st Class Mail server is just that. An actual email
server, very easy to use. In fact this message is coming from my 1st Class
Mail Server via Outlook on a dynamic IP. I could use Eudora or any email
client. And it has a Web Mail interface if you want to use that too. I have
15 websites and email for each with as many mailboxes as needed. In the
trial version you can send email with a banner at the bottom I think
forever. To get rid of the banner you have to register each site. I even set
up subdomains with their own email. For instance I had a subdomain at
www.swptsa.usaiway.net (no longer active) and their own email at
mailbox@swptsa.usaiway.net


Again if you're interested its www.1cis.com.

Ron

The main advantage is that I can mail the original authors of Squirrel Mail
in the first place and get a same-day response from them (Luke and Nathan
Ehresman).  Granted they aren't the owners of that popular project any
more, but I know them personally.

Squirrel Mail was made to allow PHP to talk to IMAP and POP3 servers
without the need for add-on modules by only using PHP's TCP/IP sockets
implementation.  You simply download it and it works.  At least that was
the idea.  It expanded from there to add multi-lingual support, custom
themes, etc.  You know...the way open source naturally bloats itself
needlessly :)

>From what I gathered, the Squirrl Mail code base used to have a lot of
unnecessary Apache/PHP-specific dependencies.  Maybe the current team has
fixed some of those more recently so IIS and other servers can use it
without nearly as many issues.

Hello members,

first off, I am not involved in any way and I don't want to make "advertisement" for 
sqirrelmail. This is a xitami list, but sometimes one has  a need for a program to work 
with a webserver, and that is the case with sqirrelmail.

The answer is plain and simple:
Sqirrelmail is a webmail interface with which one can connect to his e-mail box from 
anywhere over the internet. The only need is a browser, as long as there is an imap 
mailserver where the mailbox resides on.You don't need a mailprogramm to check your 
mail. 
And it is not a mailserver and for sure not ment to sent mail to the authors of 
squirrelmail.

The reason for the project:
As I have different mailboxes for the business and privatly, I wanted to be able to 
controll my mail from "anywhere". There are several webmail interfaces out, to just 
name a few; Horde, Ilohamail, and more and there is as well the www.mail2web.com 
which I used a lot over the time. But I wanted my own one, especially as I am running 
my own mailserver for over 3 years now, for privat and business. And a small 
challenge.
Everyone was talking Apache, IIS with ISAPI and by searching the sqirrelmail sites I 
found that someone got it running on xitami CGI. And that got me thinking and I just 
asked here on the list if someone had experience with setting up sqirrelmail on xitami.

I got 2 responses, Ron and Fokke Nauta. Fokke tried it and didn't got it to work and I 
thought, lets try it, if its not working, okay I have still the other options. But it worked and 
one reason more to stick with xitami.

As I mentioned yesterday, if there is interest, I will share my experience. If there is more 
then the 2 requests so far, I will sit down and create some simple websites, otherwise I 
just make up a description and sent it by mail off list.

And here the url http://www.squirrelmail.org/  for the program (if its allowed)

with a webserver, and that is the case with sqirrelmail.

The answer is plain and simple:
Sqirrelmail is a webmail interface with which one can connect to his e-mail box from 
anywhere over the internet. The only need is a browser, as long as there is an imap 
mailserver where the mailbox resides on.You don't need a mailprogramm to check your 
mail. 
And it is not a mailserver and for sure not ment to sent mail to the authors of 
squirrelmail.

The reason for the project:
As I have different mailboxes for the business and privatly, I wanted to be able to 
controll my mail from "anywhere". There are several webmail interfaces out, to just 
name a few; Horde, Ilohamail, and more and there is as well the www.mail2web.com 
which I used a lot over the time. But I wanted my own one, especially as I am running 
my own mailserver for over 3 years now, for privat and business. And a small 
challenge.
Everyone was talking Apache, IIS with ISAPI and by searching the sqirrelmail sites I 
found that someone got it running on xitami CGI. And that got me thinking and I just 
asked here on the list if someone had experience with setting up sqirrelmail on xitami.

I got 2 responses, Ron and Fokke Nauta. Fokke tried it and didn't got it to work and I 
thought, lets try it, if its not working, okay I have still the other options. But it worked and 
one reason more to stick with xitami.

As I mentioned yesterday, if there is interest, I will share my experience. If there is more 
then the 2 requests so far, I will sit down and create some simple websites, otherwise I 
just make up a description and sent it by mail off list.

Hello !

A nice utility to check the headers of transmitted files:

http://afr_upd.verfaillie.be:20800/cgi-bin/gap?www.verfaillie.com	
or
http://web.verfaillie.com/cgi-bin/gap?www.verfaillie.com

replace the query string with the domain [:port] [directory] [file]

I wrote it first to check if my home server was responding (using the the 
corporate server as "client"), but it can also be used to show the headers.

Hello Marc,

very handy to control ones own server and to be able to check the server software of a 
site without the need of using Netcraft. What is the reason for the limit of bytes ? 
Otherwise one would be able to check how the full page will look like ( development).

Is there the possibilty to share this ? If so, what would be needed ?

Johannes

I created the application just to check if my home server was responding to 
internet requests, where it doesn't matter that 1500 bytes or more are 
displayed.
1500 bytes seemed a good compromis between speed and size; the data must be 
downloaded before it can be send to the client. Xitami is set to kill 
applications running more than 10 seconds, and in some cases connecting and 
downloading large files could not be done in 10 seconds.
Two connections are open during the whole transaction.


There are two versions available:

http://web.verfaillie.com/cgi-bin/gap?www.verfaillie.com (displaying the 
content as text)

http://afr_upd.verfaillie.be:20800/cgi-bin/gap?www.verfaillie.com (trying 
to display the content as html)

The source and executable are disponible at
http://web.verfaillie.com/cgi/gap.bas
http://web.verfaillie.com/cgi/gap.exe
It just runs as a cgi-bin executable.

Johannes,

Either way you want to do it.  A description of the steps or a webpage that 
goes through the process is fine by me.  I am just glad to know it can be 
done and I am highly interested in knowing how so I can one day, sooner than 
later, deploy it myself.  Thanks for your time into this.

That would make sense.  1500 would be the max size packet anyone would want 
to create.  Most router circuits are set to 1545 MTU (max transmission 
unit).  Anything larger than that requires the router to split the packet 
giving the first 1500 to FRAME 1 and giving the reamainder to a new FRAME.  
That new packet though can't be used by any other data.  so if your server 
packets are 1700, the first 1500 bytes goes to the first frame, then 200 
bytes goes to the second frame, but the second frame is then filled up with 
1300 bytes of nothing simply to fill the frame - it has to happen this way 
because a FRAME can only carry on TCP header.  Larger packets causes the 
router to take a heavier processing load and slightly greater bandwidth 
load.

Apply that logic to smaller server packets, say 850bytes per packet.  Then 
every frame for that TCP transmission will be 850bits of data and 600 bits 
of nothing.  This causes the router to waste nearly 45% of its bandwidth 
(for that particular tcp session).  If your packets match the MTU of the 
router then no framing is wasted, the router doesn't have to parse packets 
which decreases processing/reassembly time, and excess frames do not have to 
be sent.

Hi,

I would be pleased with an example of how you configured Xitami and PHP.
Just an example of alterations to the Xitami and PHP config file. That
should be sufficient to make it work, I think.

With regards,

Thanks.  That tip came from 14 years as a network engineer, which is my 
primary technical expertise.  Web Hosting and web design are side hobbies of 
mine that keeps me somewhat current with servers, windows and other system 
specific trends.  However, server performance is just as inportant as 
network performance.  If you are aware of both you increase your overall 
optimization.  No server is completely independent, nor is any network.

NIC settings, duplex mismatches, L2 switch parameters, L3 switch/router 
protocols - all affect network performance.  You can have the fastest server 
in the world sitting on an improperly configured network (or vise versa) and 
see the worst response times.  It would be like putting 87 octane into an 
Ferrari that requires 103 octane.  She's gonna choke and sputter and 
possible stall out.

If I can think of any other tips, along these lines, I will put them out 
there.  This tip just happened to be related someone elses topic.

Is there a way to do a 404 pages for each virtual site in Xitami?

It is, unfortunately, a bit hard to make custom pages (I /think/ you 
can specify error pages for each virtual domain but I am not sure, if 
you can it's in the online help).

However: You can't use dynamic pages, either. My solution to this 
(which will also solve the virtual domain problem) is to use a 
frameset as error page. It maps to a "normal" php page, which can 
then check the "referrer" field for different sites, do some smart 
mapping/redirecting for "known errors" etc.

Check out (for example) www.9000.org/ewrwerw compared to 
www.9000.org/manual/to_mount_a_lens

then you'll have to set IE not to display its own error messages. The

Hi Ron, nothing easier than that.

I just tried after I saw your messge.
2 steps:

1. create a dir for each of your virtual domains in the error dir
like \xitami-25\app\errors\virtualdomainname

2. open up your admin interface, open your virtual domain, go to errors,
in there change the path to @errors\virtualdomainname\page
save all the way back thtough , restart and you are done.

Ok I'll probably have to turn off the script file usage, and I want to use a
PHP page. Do you think it needs a seperate dir per site or just a different
file per site?

Ok this really worked good and simple once I analyzed what was going on.

In my site.cfg in this case miplanet.com I just added this under [Server]
remove the @error

text-404=test404.php

test404.php looks like this

<?php
$shorturl = 'http://www.miplanet.com/404.php';
header("Location: $shorturl");
?>

But it could be anything I want in this case I can keep my 404.php in my
site dir and redirect the 404 error to that file.

Sweet.

Ron

it would make it easier you have a better overview/controll. Otherwise you have the 
same # of each error page as virtual domains. Think down the road.

Ok now for some reason Xitami can't figure out that it's a PHP file. I think
it thinks its an html so its not running the php.

I am running version 2.4d9 and came across an interesting setting and am I 
not certain what it specifically pertains to.  Through the Admin GUI (not 
the web gui), that shows you "Xitami Web Server Properties" there is a 
setting for "Kb allocated: 617" - what is that number specifically referring 
to?  Is that how much memory Xitami is taking up or is that a 
setting/reference to bandwidth or what?

Thanx,

Ok, love Xitami.  Love my mail server - MailEnable Standard 
(www.mailenable.com). The Strandard version is free but does not come with 
IMAP built into it, which is required for Squirrel Mail to work.  MailEnable 
Professional has IMAP and HTTPMail built into it and costs $220, but if I 
upgrade to MailEnable Professional for the IMAP feature required for 
Squirrel Mail then I won't need Squirrel Mail at all b/c ME Professional has 
HTTPMail built into it.  Total Catch-22.

SSOOOOO - anyone know of another good, free, easy to manage mail server that 
has IMAP built into it so I can get Squirrel Mail to work?

Man, all this trouble isn't worth saving $220.  I might as well just bite 
the bullet on this one, pay the $220 and get a fully enabled MailEnable 
Professional that has WebMail built into it.

arg!

Hi Russel,

get Mercury Mail, its free and a piece of cake to set up.:):)
here the download link  
http://www.pmail.com/downloads_maine_t.htm

get mercury Mail transport system for win32 and install. The instructions are easy to 
understand. just make sure to install only Merc S (smtp) and Merc I (imap), make your 
settings and you are ready to go.

If you need some configuring help, write and I will sit down and give a brief desribtion.

I love the mailserver and have it running over 3 years now.

Hi all,

I am using Mercury now for 1 year and never had any problem.
It is a stable and easy to configure mail server. It runs as a Firedeamon
service on NT4.
I can recommend it as well!

Can Mercury be installed as a real service in Win2000 or do I need 
FireDaemon to get it installed as a service for W2K?

Will look into it tonight.

  Mine is strictly experimental and I've not had time to check it out very 
much, but I wanted to try to set up a simple "free" mail server on my xp, if 
for no other reason than to give my site, and those that help with my site, 
a "site-branded email addresses" so I went with the ArGoSoft mail server, 
and it seems to be right on!  Very simple set up, free version, small but 
powerful, and will work with current email client; ie: outlook ex. etc. You 
will need the Pro version for an IMAP module, but it's not much, and 
ArGoSoft is a fully functional SMTP/POP3/Finger server "for Windows" which 
is a major plus for me!   I hope this might be useful to someone, and 
although I've not had time to work with mine much at all as far as security 
etc; goes, if anyone wants to take a look at the webface or even try it out 
you can check what I've got so far at: http://www.sorcep.com:8010  and you 
can get your own or check it out further if you'd like at: 
http://www.argosoft.com/mailserver/

   thanks guys; take care!   harth

Subject: [Xitami] building open xitami on OS/2
Message-ID: <426F6081.CD6F0BA0@libero.it>

Hi all,

I've been able to build available sources (2.5c2) on OS/2 compiling all .c
files in every subdir and creating a library and then compiling xitami.c and
adding all those libraries to it.

It works ok but cannot send pages bigger than 32KB, smaller pages get sent ok
and even CGIs are called ok but if a cgi creates an output bigger than 32kb
only the first 32kb are sent back to the client.

So, the question is, is there something which should be set/configured? I've
quickly looked at the sources but nothing obvious comes to mind.

Thanks.

PS I'm using GCC with options: COPTS=-DTCPV40HDRS -O2 -Wall -pedantic

There is a 32k buffer defined in the code which does the file transfers 
(smttran), so that's probably involved.  It should transfer the file in 
chunks until it's finished.  Only transferring the first file... I assume 
you're not getting any errors in the console.log?  If you are up to changing 
the code, you can add traces (printf) to smttran.c at various points around 
lines 1102-1122 to see what's going on.

You might also want to try the 2.4 package - it's unlikely to behave 
differently but if it does, we may get a clue as to what's happening.

We don't have any OS/2 systems here (our last working OS/2 box died some years 
ago), so it's going to be rather hard to dig into this.

I've run across this same error on the windows compile.  For some 
users/browsers (about 5%-%6 of my users) my large CGI pages would only 
load part way (send so much) much then stop.  I was eventualy forced to 
fall back to Xitami 2.4d9 which works stable with CGI.  Any ideas as to 
why these errors?

it was defined as 32768L, I changed it to 32767L and this fixed this problem
(don't know exactly why), now I can transfer pages of any size (even calling CGIs
through LRWP), so now I can start testing my build again :)

If you need any help setting up one, I'm here :)

Thanks for your help!

Maurilio.

PS. If I'd want to merge changes to the source, what is the "correct" way? I mean,
send a patch here, to you, or...?

I keep getting an Assertion Failed message.  The complete message is:

I'm running 2.5c2 on Windows 98 in a lightly loaded system.

Any ideas?  It keeps crashing several times a week.

Can't you just add the 'index.cgi' as an include and set the server to pars=
e
html?

  Thanks!  I've always been unable to "include" and don't know why.  I do 
remember that it has become so frustrating to me that I stop trying before I 
figure it out. At least up until now that's been the case.  I'm just not 
seeing it as I should I guess, but no matter what I do I can ONLY get the 
following return:

[xitami SSI: ]

  And that's the BEST I can do so far.  Usually it's nothing at all.. Thanks 
again  but I'm sure someone can explain what I'm overlooking, (I'm sure 
something simple, hopefully)..

Are you doing <!--#include ...

or

<!--#exec ....

The latter is what I use for running CGI scripts for SSI

  Actually I've tried them all, however I understand that <!--#exec 
cgi="path.cgi"--> is the one I'm SUPPOSED to use, correct?  Something is 
just not right, (most likely me), but I'm ending up causing more potentual 
problems than making any progress it seems..   I've tried full path, sys 
path, long and short urls, and everything I can think of. I have even tried 
to make a few of the "fake ssi" scripts I'm aware of etc; work (that have in 
the past), and cannot even get ANY thing at all to create an include on my 
site..  I appreciate any advice or suggestions  STILL!

I can answer the second, Yes Xitami will do quite well with oscommerce. I'm
not sure what you mean by database powered websites. If you mean PHP and
mySQL then the answer is Yes with no problems. All my sites are PHP and
MySQL.
