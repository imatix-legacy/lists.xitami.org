Hi James,

Thanks for that advice - I ended up going with Apache in the end but
Thomas' advice was very handy in setting up the hosts file and I'm
working fine now at home. 

I would like to run a local copy of Apache though at work also now I
have this working at home so everyone can upload and view pages locally
before syncing them with the server. I will have a go using your example
on the peered network. We're out in Russia at the moment and the high
bandwidth costs are making us much more careful than we were previously
in the UK! 

I don't quite understand though how a user on our network here
'switches' between the local intranet and the internet generally. At
home I have now configured virtual hosts so that when I type in
domain.com I arrive at the site as per normal - would the users here
type IP numbers instead? I know this isn't a Xitami question though so I
would quite understand if you don't answer.


Best regards,

Nick

Hi Nick

Thomas gave you good advice for a lone pc. If  you are useing a peer to
peer
network and need the sites to be seen by all network peers. you should
use
the ip for your network interface card not the 127.0.0.1 loopback ip. I
copy
a master host file to all the pc's in our network.

sample..................................................................
....
.......

#IP Address     Name                  Comments

127.0.0.1          localhost              #Loop back IP/Name

192.168.0.0     desk1                    #Default IP & Names
192.168.0.1     desk2                    #Default IP & Names
192.168.0.2     desk3                    #Default IP & Names
192.168.0.3     desk4                    #Default IP & Names
192.168.0.4     desk5                    #Default IP & Names
192.168.0.5     desk6                    #Default IP & Names

192.168.0.0     company.frim       #In house IP & Names
192.168.0.0     company.com       #In house IP & Names
192.168.0.5     company.web       #In house IP & Names
127.0.0.1         testthis.test           #Local test site

Hi Nick

The host file acts as a DNS server in that it assigns names to IP numbers.
When you set up your network each computer was given a name in the sample i
use desk1 thrugh desk6. In the sample both desk1 and desk6 are runnning web
servers. To see the web site on the computer named desk6 type in any of the
following in the address bar of your web browser, the the computer's network
name "desk6", the site name "company.web" or the IP address. Your browser
checks the host file of the computer it is running on befor it gose online.

Well, that last depends upon the operating system hosting the broswer;
for instance, under eComStation <http://www.ecomstation.com> one needs to
tick "Use HOSTS file first" in the TCP/IP properties.  Same goes for most
other proper operating systems.

Hi Jill,

Your sites shouldn't "cancel" each other out at all.  I host a dozen sites  
and folks can visit any of them at any time.

Are you using the virtual host capabilities of Xitami?  i.e. do you have  
separate configuration files for each of your hosts, and these files are  
referenced in your xitami.cfg (or better yet, a default.cfg)?

If you have a VERY slow Internet connection and complicated pages, it's  
possible that you're seeing a white page while Xitami delivers the goods  
to you.  Do you see a progress bar or any other indication that the site  
is still loading while you see that white page?

Michael

Subject: [Xitami] directory listing locationbar
Message-ID: <40C1AB2A.27819.4CB54C@localhost>

Hello Members,

I'm a newbie in webpage creation and it's maybe a stupid question, so forgive me.
Xitami 2.5b6
Is it possible to deny directory listings in the location bar ?
Here is a bit more explanation what I try to accomplish.
Say my site is www.domain.com and I have pictures in a folder called /photos.
I know when the page is showing in the browser you can get the page info which is showing like
http://www.mydomain.com/photos/special.gif

I know this now,and I'm able to put this address into the locationbar of the browser and call the 
file directly into my browser without opening the actual website where the .gif file is embedded 
in. And this action I want to deny; to call the file directly into the browser from the locationbar 
as described in the sentence before. 

Is there any possibility in xitami to do so ? The viewer should ONLY be able to load the websites 
in the "normal" way.

Johannes

There are no stupid questions.
For a web server each request (main page, first gif, first jpg, first 
javascript source, second gif, ... and so on) is a completely new one. The 
browser has no memory of what was loaded before (except if it looks in the 
logs).

To prevent the usage of your gif, you must create it on-the-fly (using a 
script, for instance).
You also need some server scripts.
This is just one example, they are probably more possibilities:

<html>
<script src=cgi-bin/create.js></script>
<script>
function makegif(a)
{
document.write("<img src=' + a + b + '.gif'>");
}
</script>
<body>
<h1>This is my protected gif:</h1>
<script>
makegif("photos/special");
makegif("photos/second");
</script></body></html>

The function "makegif" in your html will create the call to the gif 
on-the-fly, using the parameter that's provided by create.js

Now the special thing resides in create.js.
It's a script that produces a single output line (using a random generator)

var b = 124582134;

and renames the image to
photos/special124582134.gif and the same with the second gif.

For more help (and maybe an easier way to do it), you could ask it on the 
webreference forum:

because of this randomly chosen "extended" file name the viewer actually isn't able to call the

Being the php guy that I am, may I suggest that you write a php script  
that takes the gif that you want to display, copies it to someting else  
(temp.gif, perhaps), displays that, and then deletes the copy.  Since php  
is compiled before the page is delivered, all you see for source code is a  
reference to temp.gif, which won't exist by the time the visitor tries to  
find it.  You won't see any php script in the final web output, and so the  
visitor won't know the real name of the picture he's looking at.

It sounds from your question that you might also be wondering about how to  
supress directory listings in Xitami itself.  That is a setting in  
xitami.cfg.  Set dirlist equal to zero, and directory listings won't be  
displayed for any directory.  Or, put an index.html file in your pictures  
directory containing a blank page.

As I see it, there is no way to protect images from getting captured. If you
have a nice image, it can be plagiarized. So here is the way I would do it
and this by no means is perfect either.

Thumbnails are usually not very good quality, and to make them even less
quality you can save them as low as 35% and they can still be of good enough
quality to see. Now the issue is when they click that thumbnail what do they
see? If I wanted to protect my images but yet make them accessible then I
would require a registration and maybe a small fee to see a quality image,
upon registration I would make sure they they read or at least agree with a
disclaimer that they will not plagiarize the images and the fact that they
registered and paid a fee will usually mean I at least know where they live
and maybe their phone number. That gives you a legal foot to stand on. For
those who choose to remain anonymous they would maybe see an image with some
markings or watermark ("Copyright Material" would be good). Something that
they could not use without destroying the original. Only registered users
would be able to view the image without the copyright. However I still would
embed it in image in case it was downloaded. The one thing about just
breaking up the image or changing the file name is, once it is displayed, it
can be plagiarized with a program like Paint Shop Pro. (Screen Area Capture)
And just doing the simple, disable right click, will stop a lot of people.
And to protect a directory, put in a index.html.

The internet opens up a whole new can of copyright worms and plagiarization
of material is rampant. Laws in one country don't protect you in other
countries. So the best course of action is on the server end.

Hello Ron, Michael,

thank you for your ideas and thoughts.
Ron, your idea is good, but I don't have this kind of important images that I want to mess around 
with "legal" stuff. Have already (C) and company name on the image.

Michael, what you discribed is actually the way I would like to see this happening. Marc mentioned 
something similar as well; a temporary file made by a script which the visitor is not able to find. 
And what I didn't know yet, that a php script is even not visible in the output from the 
webpage.Even better !  -:)  So even with the "view page info" you wan't be able to download the 
file because all what one see is the temporary file name.
regards xitami I have set directory listings = 0 in my default.cfg
What I don't get right now is, put a blank index.htm in the directory what you want to protect.
What should happen if I have a blank index.htm in that particular directory ? Sorry stupid 
question, but I'm still a starter in webpage development.

Johannes

I once made a site for a german photographer, and we agreed to only use a 
login/password combination for access to restricted parts. The free parts 
are on his server, the protected parts and scripts on mine.
It's easy to implement and provides the most secure protection in it's 
kind. Of course we are not talking here of bank transactions protection, 
but basic image protection.

Message-ID: <000701c44fe2$4d7c6e20$0200a8c0@TiltRacLaptop>

Is there a way to get and set cookies in an LRWP program which runs
alongside Xitami? I know how to use cookies from java script, but it would
be more efficient to do it directly from the server side.

Another part of this question: is it possible to set cooke values for ANY
logged in user? Or by nature do cookies only apply to the current logged in
user?

Thanks
Brian

Has anybody managed to install the latest Xitami httpd/ftpd?

I presume it also needs rbase and installed that too but have had no
success with geting Xitami to build 

Thanks in advance if anybody can put me straight.

[ Running slackware-current, 2.4.26 kernel, no gnome or kde but xorg6.7 with
CVS Fluxbox if any of those actually make any difference to the install ]

I had a real bear of a time getting 2.5c1 (or 2.4d10) to build from
source.  Apparently the Windows versions work just great for everybody,
but when I picked up the source tree there were several problems that
prevented it from compiling (at least under linux).


As far as I know, you shouldn't need the rbase stuff to build xitami -
the source tree comes with the stuff that it appears to need (smt, sfl,
etc.) ... though if you do need rbase then that would explain a little.
There's no mention of rbase on xitami.com, but then xitami.com doesn't
really reflect the current state of the product so it's not a good
reference.

First step, do a 'find' in the source tree to see if you have a file
called "c" in each subdirectory ... if you don't, you can get a copy from
http://eep.burdell.org/c which (I think) is edited a bit so that it
actually works.

Then make the build.sh script executable (it also helps on some systems
to add #!/bin/bash to the first line) and give it a run and see where
you get.

Well I want to thank you for your advice.

But it seems that whatever I do I cannot get xitami to compile correctly or
even in fact compile at all.

I had already imported the ``c'' file from the 2.5b5 version and also
imported what libraries I could find although I was unable to find libstu.a
and libaxc.a and additionally made the build.sh file, plus the boomake and
makefiles executable. I also tried the ``c'' file that you recommended with
no better results.

The build script build.sh seems to go through the motions finally abandoning
the attempt with ''can't find xitami'' after hundreds of warnings.

I next tried modifying the build script to remove the openssl and xipro
directory references and which didn't seem to be created upon untarring the
tarball.  That did not correct the situation.

So I tried compiling the various directories without using the build.sh
file.

These are my findings:

In sfl, (standard function library) ./boomake build  produces a file
``-g.lst'' which simply  contains ``gcc: no input files''

Having deleted ``-g.lst'', ``./c *.c'' actually produces the object files
and ``./boomake build install'' appears to work and in fact sets up the
/usr/local/imatix directory and transfers over some files. Whether all the
requisite files are installed I do not know, but I was hopeful at this stage
although there were numerous bitches as follows:
egrep -g.c No such file or directory
compiling -g
cat: invalid option -g

Anyway moving on to GSL, following the same procedure ``./c *.c'' gave a
multitude of errors and I abandoned the project.

I would like to run the latest version. But at least 2.5b5 runs perfectly
and I can always fall back on apache/proftpd if the need should ever arise.

Message-ID: <642.661T1050T8122818rachael@rachael.dyndns.org>

Hello

I working on a small lrwp implementation in php, dont get up of your
chair yet, its done as a php programing which registers it self 
with xitami to handle .php files, when it recives a request
it runs that php file though eval(),while it seems to be working as
it should, I`m having a few problems with GET.

Seems at the infomation containt in a GET is neither in the ENV nor 
the POST part of the LRWP request. Anyone here that have build a lrwp 
application and have had that problem ?

regards Jacob Dahl Pind

proftpd that comes with slackware is pretty nice; I've got FTP turned
off on xitami and use that instead.  *shrug*

Anyway, I went back to some notes I made about the build process and
found a bunch of the changes I made.  Here they are, in a conveniently
patchable (-p1) form:

... in a nutshell, the COPTS variable in the various boomake scripts
doesn't get passed correctly, so you have to use the CCOPTS variable in
the c file for that stuff and remove it from boomake.  That takes care
of the -g.c and -g.lst issues.  Next, you've got to either use -lm or
have included math.h for any file using floor, and I didn't have the
patience to sort through the build system and figure out how to use -lm
just for those files, so I added math.h to ggeval.c and ggstrn.c.
Then in smthttpl.c there's a typo; it shouldn't compile for anyone but
apparently it compiled for the Windows people so whatever.



Assuming the patch applied correctly (it should but I didn't try it ...
just make sure to have a clean source tree), here's what I did next:

cd sfl
CCNAME=gcc \
CCPRODLEVEL=production \
CCOPTS="<stuff whatever you want here; don't use what's in c>" \
sh boomake build install

cd ../gsl
CCNAME=gcc \
CCPRODLEVEL=production \
CCOPTS="<your flags> \
   -I/usr/local/imatix/xitami-25/include \
	-L/usr/local/imatix/xitami-25/lib" \
sh boomake build install


At this point you might see some linker errors during the build process;
just ignore them.


cd ../smt
<repeat gsl's command line>

cd ../studio
<repeat>

cd ../xiadmin
<repeat>

cd ../xiopen
<repeat>

Now, add to the end of the end of the build line (i.e. after CCOPTS):

CCLIBS="/usr/local/imatix/xitami-25/lib/libgsl.a \
   /usr/local/imatix/xitami-25/lib/libsfl.a \
	/usr/local/imatix/xitami-25/lib/libxac.a \
	/usr/local/imatix/xitami-25/lib/libstu.a \
	/usr/local/imatix/xitami-25/lib/libsmt.a"


... and repeat the process (sfl, gsl, etc.).  In these builds you should
definitely not ignore compiler/linker errors.  But with any amount of
luck, you won't get any.



oh oh oh I almost forgot.  If you want to use php, you need to make
another change:

You may want to try first without this patch, since I'm apparently the
only person in the world who had this problem, but I couldn't find any
other way around it.


Anyway, hope all this stuff works.

For Acess and Error Logs the standard configuration is CLFX for the Common 
Log File Format, and could be changed under 'format' in the respective 
sections of the configuration file...
As I use a log analyzer that does a more profound job using the 'Combined 
Log Format' I wonder a) if Xitami supports this and b) what I should enter 
under the 'format' key to obtain this layout ?

Xitami needs to post these articles on their website (or link to them) and 
needs to perform some of these tests themselves (then post the results).  
These results are outstanding.

first off, I received Jason's email about the "unsubscribe" but I didn't 
receive Ewen's email - I was only able to read Ewens response through 
Jason's response.  Which makes me believe I am missing Xitami list emails.  
not good.

seond off, I always thought that last link in the Xitami emails was to 
"unsubscribe" It doesn't really indicate there are more options at that link 
-  so I never bothered to click to it.

Anyone recommend any good WAP resources or freeware stuff to get started 
with.  I never programmed in WAP before but I already have a full 
functioning website and think its a site prefectly suited for wireless 
devices.

one is "blessed" with using=20

Such information has traditionally been included in the headers of most
proper mailing lists for at least the 23 years I've been using them.
Proper MUAs make it easy for the user to see such pertinent information.

YMMV.

   fix (vb.): 1. to paper over, obscure, hide from public view; 2. to
   work around, in a way that produces unintended consequences that are
   worse than the original problem.  Usage: "Windows ME fixes many of the
   shortcomings of Windows 98 SE".

I looked at WAP a while back and then just a month ago. Seems that the
standard is turning toward XHTML. A source for research and tools, including
a phone simulator to test your apps can be found at

Here is my reply from 2002:


The original purpose was as a wml server, however with a little

creativity, the possibilities are limitless. Example: a portal

server:  the ability to access your customized applications through

personal computers and the full range of mobile devices -including

Palm, PocketPC, I-mode, WAP and other internet-enabled phones,

Blackberry, and even traditional voice phones.


One of our current projects applies this to satellite radio. But

then again, you don't have to use Xitami for this. The original

question was about serving wml.


Cheers,

William R. Palaia
