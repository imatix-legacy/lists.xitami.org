Subject: [Xitami] Xitami on OS X
Message-ID: <D52690BC-7B60-11D7-8A87-00039301ACF8@mercury1.astcomm.net>

I've been away from Xitami for awhile in a production environment, but 
I generally keep a copy of it running for testing purposes on at least 
one machine.  We've now converted all our servers from Linux to OS X 
Server on Apple X Serve's.  Has anyone compiled Xitami on OS X yet?  I 
briefly tried it, but xibuild halted with some errors.  Rather than 
spend a bunch of time researching what needs to be changed on my own, I 
thought it might be beneficial to ask first from someone who has done 
it, what changes have to be made to the UNIX build file to get it to 
compile on OS X or the PowerPC version of Darwin.

TIA,

If it will help, I sent the output to a text file which is pasted 
below.  I'm experimenting with the build on a Titanium Powerbook 
running OS X 10.2.5 Jaguar, compiling from a tcsh shell.  I'm running 
xibuild under my user login, but su root makes no difference - I get 
the same output.  As the output notes;

"If the ANSI C compile command is wrong, you will have to modify the
'c' scripts in these directories:
     /Users/chris/desktop/xitami-24d9/src/sfl, 
/Users/chris/desktop/xitami-24d9/src/smt"

however, the gcc C compiler in Darwin/OS X is the same one used in 
Linux or BSD, so I would assume nothing has to be changed in that 
respect.

After trying another program, Squirrel Mail, I've determined that this is a
Windows XP/ PHP / Xitami Problem.  The Squirrel Mail scripts don't seem to
be resolving directories appropriately: i.e. off by one from the current
directory, although not consistently.

I've gone through the .ini files and .cfg files several times now and tried
a lot of different settings, to no avail.  

Has anyone had a similar experience? Does anyone have these things working
well together?  Maybe I can get a copy of your appropriate Xitami cfg (is
there something about cgi-bin I'm overlooking) and php.ini files. I am
calling php.exe via [Filters].

Thanks,
Dennis

Subject: [Xitami] nocc and/or php problem

I'm trying to configure NOCC as a webmail server.  The problem that I'm
having is that NOCC doesn't seem to be able to share variables among its
various parts.  I.e., it can't 'remember' the password from the index.php
script to the action.php script:

Notice: Undefined variable: passwd in
C:\Xitami\webpages\pubhome\nocc\action.php on line 24
  
Another symptom is that I'm getting this notice when I load index.php:
Notice: Undefined variable: HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE in
C:\Xitami\webpages\pubhome\nocc\check_lang.php on line 17

However, 
if I let PHP register variables globally, it works fairly well.
register_globals = On    in php.ini

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Dennis

Can't help you with SquirrelMail but have you tried Blat (SMTP). We've found it
to be very effective and reliable. 

The only problem I ever had was when generating emails too quickly; a slight
pause between each batch solved that.

The problem with sub directories is cleared! I did some changes to the

But the problem persists: Xitami shows ALL possibilities with no real error
( [xitami SSI: ] ) . So I mean it doesn't understand if/elif  cases. On the
real (Apache-) Server all works fine.

I try with SSI to include files: <!--#include virtual="includes/xxx.htm" -->
but Xitami doesn't find these files. testssi.ssi works fine the crux seems
to be the sub directory.

Ana help?

I'm still looking for an answer to this. I want to know how to run a delay

Any ideas?

Let me clarify this, I'm getting someone who continues to post links to porn

that user but rather than blocking them on just one site I would like to
block them from all sites.

Ok so I run a router where I allow access only on specific ports. What is a
firewall going to do for me that I can't do with the router? I will still
have to give access to the email server and the web server.

depends on the router type is it just NAT

it does not protect you from Trojan programs or hacks coming from your computer

Maybe you can manage blocking the ip just to port 80, asumming that this =
is
the port you use tu run xitami on....

just a thought.

As far as I know Xitami it selv can=B4t deny acces from an ip...

Luck to you:

Guys, Guys,

Take a look at this I found in the xitami.cfg, I think this is what I'm
looking for. I have tested it by putting an ! in front of the IP address I
want to block then a comma * to give access to all others. As far as I can
tell it will work. At least it didn't block a friend from connecting. But I
don't know if it will block the IP of the offender yet.

#   Limits the set of clients that can connect to the HTTP server.
#   This provides an easy way of creating an extranet web service -
#   you can put your server on the Internet, but allow access to a
#   fixed set of IP addresses. Use 'webmask=local' to specify just
#   local addresses, or 'webmask=item,item,...' to specify one or more
#   types of access. Each item allows or excludes some IP address(es):
#   '250.12.13.*' allows matching addresses, '!250.12.13.*' excludes
#   matching addresses (but does not allow others). '!250.12.13.*,*'
#   excludes one set of addresses and allows all others.
#   'webmask=@iplist.txt' reads the list of webmasks from a text file.

The problem with sub directories is cleared! I did some changes to the
script and mixed the lines and so the turn.

But the problem persists: Xitami shows ALL possibilities with no real error
( [xitami SSI: ] ) . So I mean it doesn't understand if/elif  cases. On the
real (Apache-) Server all works fine.

Betreff: [Xitami] SSI again

I try with SSI to include files: <!--#include virtual="includes/xxx.htm" -->
but Xitami doesn't find these files. testssi.ssi works fine the crux seems
to be the sub directory.

Ana help?

If anyone would like to see a dynanic sample of LRWP running on a xitami

Our latest incarnation of the page http://www.mystarslive.com/ uses a 
background windows app that feeds star charts (using LRWP) to the page

The page itself is actually a subpage within our main CMS - all running

Are you running it as an App or Service?
I've had these same problems, running as an App. People here convinced me to
run Xitami as a service, and it's been stable ever since.
The only problem I am having with it, is the service starts before my
firewall. Right now I am starting it by hand after boot.

If I'm not mistaken, uninstalling an reinstalling Xitami and your firewall
in different orders can fix this.

In my win98/Start/Programs/Start Up/ folder, I have a shortcut.  The target 
run line in the shortcut properties  here for example,  reads ;
"G:\Cwood\delayer.exe" "H:\Xitami\xidos32.exe" /D55
.....the ending   /D55 above    delays the start of   xidos32    55 seconds.

Hello !

Check if no other server is using port 80 (like MS PWS).

Start/Settings/Control panel/Add-Remove programs
and look there for some web server and remove.

Does 127.0.0.1 show "Welcome to Xitami" or "MS PWS" ? (Microsoft
Personal Web Service)

Windows machines often pick-up PWS, MS's cut-down version of their
flagship IIS web service. It is in the box on several versions of
Windows, can be downloaded free, and some of their web-tools (like I
think Front Page) install it even if you don't ask for it.

If so, the next question is how to kill PWS. It isn't easy. I forget
what I did years ago-- for other reasons I may have been doing a
re-format anyway. I hope someone jumps-in with an easier approach.
Does the Add/Remove programs really yank all trace of PWS?

yes - i think she originally mentioned she was running xp or w2k.... iis or
the personal web server is usually turned on by defualt.

the easiest way to turn it off is to open the computer management mmc
(start - programs - admin tools - computer management). go to SERVICES and
turn off anything related to iis or personal webserver (they are probably
set to automatic right now, change it to disabled).

Well, no, she said " on Windows ME". So MMC doesn't apply.

Hmm. Under Win2k, that doesn't seem to be an option. I can run a command
line of xiwinnt32.exe -i or -u to install or unistall the service, but not
start/pause/stop.
Maybe I'm misunderstanding how a service works in win2k.

Thanks

Xitami is working now. However, after installing php, mysql, and phpMyAdmin,
and having them all work, I've run into a problem. This webserver set up is
meant to be a testing platform before I ftp to my domain. However, I've
found that some php files will not work on locahost, but will work on the
domain. For instance http://www.jesst.com/pfw/dbmember.php?mb_id=1 works,
but when the same file is tested on the localhost, it gives a connection
error. However, http://www.jesst.com/pfw/dblistmembers.php works fine both
on jesst.com and loclhost. Any ideas what could be wrong?

Ok! I got it figured out.
The way to start a service from the command line in win2k is "
net start Servicename
Stopping is:
net stop Servicename

In this case, that is
net start "Xitami Web Server"

Throw the delayer in there and you have
delayer.exe "net start "Xitami Web Server"" /D20

BUT! Double quotes don't work. So I wrote a batch file called xitami.bat
which contains
net start "Xitami Web Server"

So my final shortcut which I placed in Startup reads
delayer.exe "xitami.bat" /D20

Our course with appropriate paths.
Finally got it!

Thanks
Tom

You could also use

  delayer.exe "net start 'Xitami Web Server'" /D20

(with single quotes at second level) instead of double quotes. It usually works.

Hi,

Currently I use the program version of Xitami and another program called
Watchdog-O-Matic to monitor it.  Watchdog-O-Matic restarts Xitami if it runs
into trouble.  I find this combination works very well and I generally don't
worry about any site down time.

I am thinking of migrating to the service version of Xitami.  Once I do
that, the monitoring utility won't work for the service.

Have you people found that the service version runs without issue.  If not,
I will just continue to use the configuration that I have.

  Rob,
Have used the service version on Win2k on two different machines(intranet  & internet) 
without any problems whatsoever. Both machines have been trouble free for over two 
years!!!

  Hey all,

   This may be a bit off topic but I was wondering if anyone knows of any 
good 'free' scripts to use with Xitami for like membership management!.. I 
am too much of a novice to try to use professional scripts! In fact I'm just 
learning to work with any of them and usually mess them up more than get 
them to run correctly! But I DO like working with them, and I would love to 
have one that allowed me to keep individual records and data on members etc; 
maybe have each of them be able to access their own areas via password..... 
Thanks all & have a good day!

Hi - I don't know if this is strictly a Xitami question or not, but here it
is

I installed Xitami at a location for use as a CGI server.
I have a different directory security password for my App directory and a
different password challenge for the cgi-bin dir, so my .AUT file looks
something like this:

[App]
   Reguser=password1

[cgi-bin]
   Advuser=CGIpassword


Everything works as expected for users who access the web server from OTHER
machines.  But the main user (who sits at the machine where Xitami is
installed) gets javascript and XSLT errors despite successfully negotiating
the password challenge dialog boxes for both the main App default web page
and some interactive CGI operations.

So it appears that on the computer where Xitami is running the biggest web
application user can use the default web page without problems but pages
that reference JavaScript files can't seem to load the JavaScript;  likewise
the CGI operations that return and embedded HREF to an XSL stylesheet cannot
load the stylesheet:  the message is  Access Denied

Default web page, Javascript files and XSLT files are all in
%XITAMI%\webpages\App directory

On the other hand, all other users who use my CGI web app seem to experience
no such problems at all?

Does this ring a bell for anyone?

OS is Win2000;  the browser is IE6   Xitami ver 2.4d9

Thanks

- steve

Hi,

	I have been away from the list for a while. Can Sokrates be used for JSP ? If
so, has anybody tried CruiseControl http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/ under
Xitami/Sokrates ?

	I was able to get Sokrates running, but I figured I should ask about JSP before
I spend more time on getting CruiseControl going.

Message-ID: <004101c31b15$07609860$0200a8c0@dsl.gtei.net>

Hi again all.
I upgraded to running Xitami as a service under win2k. I like it, except it
seems to be crashing as much as the app version did. (A few times a week.)
When it crashes, it tries it's best to fill up my hard drive with a file
called memtrace.lst. According to a previous post I read, this is a dump
file when a memory leak is detected.
This would be fine, but it sits there are grows this file until my hard
drive is full. (Last time = 31gb)
At the same time, the service never exits, therefore never gets restarted as
a service.
Version is 2.4d9.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Tom

I have myself have had good luck on my CGI server running Xitami 
on Win2000 using the console version.  I just have a .bat file to 
loop loading in case of a crash which so far seems pretty stable.
This in the bat will work:

:start
xidos32
goto start

I have also heard turning on FTP in Xitami can cause stability 
problems.  I know if I access Xitami FTP over my 100mbit LAN it 
crashes the server (not stable).  So just use WarFTPD or the like to 
keep out fragil Xitami FTP code.

So you are running the dos version? I'm a little confused, as Xiwinnt.exe is
what I am running as a NT service.
Thanks for the idea on the batch file; the problem is that xiwinnt.exe never
quits when it crashes. It just stays running, growing memtrace.lst until my
hard drive is full

Thanks, I'll look into that.

Yeah I'm just running the win/dos console version.  It workes just 
fine for me.  I have heard others say the service version works 
stable for them.  But i had problems for me with the service version 
not restarting.  My little batch file is so dummified I think it is a little 
hard for it to screw up. ;)

You can try to add a depency for the Xitami service to the Firewall 
service.

Use this Tool :
http://www.nttools-online.de/english/srvmgr.htm
(freeware)

Open it, double click on the xitami service, select depencys , select 
service tab und double click on the Firewall service to add a depency.

This should work (AFAIK)

If anyone knows.  I was thinking of getting a second DSL line to 
reverse proxy.  What I would like is for my Xitami server to serve 
both IP's on a single adapter.  Can win2k and OS/2 without 
problem bind more than one IP to one ethernet adapter?  If so 
would Xitami web serve both of those IPs?

Thanks for the info. :)  Gene

I know that OS/2 can do it, but only on the newer 32 bit TCP/IP stacks. 
It is undocumented, but you can use aliases to configure it. With:

ifconfig lan0 192.168.0.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 metric 1 mtu 1500
REM *** assign IP address to same NIC
ifconfig lan0 alias 192.168.0.200

It works. You can tell Xitami to use virtual hosts based on IP address, 
so you can have multiple domains running with it (that's how I've been 
using it) - all on OS/2 though.

Do the IP's have to be on the same subnet or can a alias be on a 
full separate subnet?(64.90.xx.xx and 204.19.xx.xx). I have 2 OS/2 
servers and 1 win2k server which is why I'm curious. :)

I never tried, but possibly it works. The tricky part is that it's 
officially undocumented. So, trying would be your only chance :-)

Certainly it's possible with OS/2 (I'm not sure why Joachim said that
it's only possible on the newer TCP/IP stack, since I once did this long
before v4.1) since I've had a single Ethernet card handling both a
Class-A[1] and a Class-C address.

Cannot say the same for certain about Win2K, although I have had one card
in an NT4 box handling both 192.168.0.0/16 and also 193.163.243.0/22;
since Win2K is essentially NT5, I don't see why that might have changed.
(Under NT4, one adds such aliases through the "Advanced Options" on the
NIC's properties page.)

[1] And yes, I *do* know that these classes haven't existed since the
advent of CIDR a decade ago :-)

Hm. As far as I know the aliasing does not work with pre-32 bit stacks.
If I'm wrong, that could have saved me a lot of trouble in the past...

We have a setup.exe that works perfect on CD-ROM.
We're using Xitami FTP to move the EXE to the Xitami Web Server.

When we download the file from the web site (HTTP) to our machine and run the setup.exe, we sometimes get a CRC error ... Decompression failed.
Not always.

The same exact EXE burned onto CD-ROM works perfect.

I'm looking for clues. Any help is appreciated.

As far as I know HTTP is ok in Xitami.  However it's FTP corrupts 
data the faster the net feed.  On my 100mbit lan if I try and transfer 
a file over 1 meg with the Xitami FTP 90% of the time it is 
corrupted. So use another FTP server if you can. 

Could your file be corrupted on transfer through FTP and then the 
HTTP is just sending you the corrputed file?  But you siad 
sometimes the HTTP transfer comes out ok?  I am not aware of 
Xitami having any HTTP trafic speed problems.  Someone else 
here may know?

Yes. Step 1 ... FTP to Xitami via Xitami FTP.
Step 2 ... http download

most times ok, sometimes not.

I will try burning a CD and installing file to server from CD and see if this fixes.

But in all cases, it works from CD ... the same EXACT setup.exe

Hummmmm ... is this correct ??
The faster the connection (Xitami FTP) the better chance of corruption ??
What about fast HTTP .... with Xitami ?
This needs some investigation ... but I'm live. Is there anything imperical on this?

Yes, Windows 2000 can do this. I suppose Xitami won't even't know that 
it is serving more than one IP address, if it is launched with the 
default setting to listen to all IP addresses (what was that, '*'?).

Hello,

People have mentioned problems with high speed FTP.
We seem to have the same problem with Xitami and HTTP.

Our setup.exe, when downloaded, brings up CRC errors.
I've created a CD-ROM and leave it in the server machine.
We copy the setup.exe every day to the web server.
When we do, and test, it's ok.
The next day, CRC error again.

I'm going to need some kind of reliable response to this as I build out a new machine.

Any ideas are welcome.

Does the FTP of Xitami support SFTP or SSL FTP?

I've been following the posts to the list for the past couple of weeks, 
and it looks like this list is Windows-centric, and possibly I 
subscribed to the wrong list.  Where do I find the people running 
Xitami on UNIX (specifically *BSD) operating systems?  I'm still trying

No you're not. Possibly Windows users have more problems implementing

No, the WORLD is windows-centric, and especially the world of small
free webservers, just because the world is littered with Windows
boxes. (Xitami is one of the few things you can put on a 386SX/16 PC
and make it usable today.)

As for BSD: a lot of BSD people use the Apache that comes in BSD.
Those who don't apparently know enough to install Xitami on BSD,
because I've seen little BSD talk here.

And historically, unix users had to know how to edit configuration
files to get unix up at all; while Windows is all "Click OK". Xitami
often needs no more than a couple clicks to get going, so is great
for that market.

OS/X is interesting and MUCH newer than Xitami. I can install OS/X
without using a trace of my old unix and hardcore-DOS skills. In
fact it took me an hour to find where Apple hid the command line. So
there would be some interest in "Xitami on X" (what a sales point!)
if it could be packed as a point-and-play binary.

The Imatix company isn't likely to do that. Xitami never brought in
enough cash to keep someone employed, but it and other demos brought
them good custom-work business that keeps them very busy.

Xitami is open source and anybody could gather a community around it
for support and development. Somehow that hasn't happened, perhaps
because Xitami "just works".

Anyway.... your OS/X comes with Apache, the most popular webserver
on this planet and very solid and well supported. Unless you have
built some Xitami-specific extension you need to run, or are deathly
afraid to edit Apache's CNF files, I don't see any benefit to
Xitami. I have Xitami running on 5 or 6 boxes, and love it, but have
used Apache-Win to work around a script-bug, and work with an
Apache-on-OSX box for another site, and Apache is good stuff. Why
not use what comes pre-installed? (Assuming it isn't trash like MS's
PWS, IIS; or lightweight like Apple's old personal web sharing.)
There is a hell of a lot more community support around Apache than
Xitami, a lot more Apache-tuned tools, and since OSX comes with
Apache it surely has more Mac community support.

> possibly I subscribed to the wrong list.

There is this list, and there is xitami-dev@lists.xitami.org which
is more for code developers. Possibly you will find someone there
who knows what a compiler is (I do but won't admit it). But traffic
is much lighter than this list, hasn't been a post in a month, and I
don't recall OSX ever being discussed there.

Anyone have any idea why Xitami corrupts an EXE file on Download. HTTP.
File was placed on server by burning a CD and copying to web folder. Not FTP.

Right now, our alternatives are ...

IIS
Reduce speed of connection.

I have to get this fixed, and fast.

Any ideas will help

We are talking bits/sec orBytes/sec here?

I have tested downloading from a local win2000 Xitami server (2.5b5) and 
with speeds of 250KBYTES/sec = 2Mbits/sec I get no corruption on a 
3MByte EXE. Done it repeatedly with no problems.

Thanks for the info Paul.  I've been running UNIX systems on big iron 
since AT&T invented System V, so I'm not afraid to edit files.  
Unfortunately, I have never used Windows any great amount so I don't 
know alot about it, and I would consider running Xitami on Windows 2000 
Server for experimentation (although I really wanted it running on my 
laptop with OS X), except we don't own a Wintel box to run Windows on - 
all our hardware is PowerPC, S/390, or SPARC.  And we do use Apache on 
all our XServe's with OS X Server, and it also comes in the workstation 
version of OS X.  But I've always liked Xitami well enough to run on my 
linux and Solaris boxen, sometimes as a lightweight development server 
running on an alternative port, but mostly for experimenting, and even 
at one time in limited light weight production use.  My C/C++ 
programming skills are horrible, and it appears the biggest problem in 
Xitami's source is prelude.h not including code to properly identify 
Darwin and it's UNIX paths so the build can progress, so it halts.  OS 
X identifies itself as Darwin, not a BSD UNIX, even though they are 
similar under the hood.  I suppose I could muck around in there and 
figure it out, but was hoping to find someone who had already done it 
to save me that "mucking around" in the source code to get it to 
compile.

now that you got me started...
I know that sometimes, faulty network cards can throw garbage data in the LAN.
This sometimes affects not only the computer with the faulty card but also the
other computers in the LAN. Just removing the bad card may change things.

740 k bits /second.
It seems to corrupt large files of any extension.

In the past, I have not had problems with Xitami FTP and have used it successfully.
When the speed of the connection went from 256 kbits /sec. to 740 kbits/ sec.
is when I believe (think) the problem started occuring.
Right when we got the software done and started winding down testing !!!!!!

Anyway ... now I am burning a CD ROM and copying from the CD to the web site.

Since I wasn't using FTP any more, I turned it off in the .CFG and restarted Xitami.
Downloaded the software again, and the Setup.Exe works.

I'll keep my eyes on this, but I believe the problem is now solved. It appears that FTP
just has to be turned on ... not used ... to get the high speed problem.

No doubt you all have discussed this 100 times and I foolishly didn't hear.

I have had Xitami running on a Win2k Pro system
serving both a 392 kbps SDSL internet connection
and a local 10/100 LAN for 2 years. Lots of HTTP
file transfers and no corruptions, ever. FTP is disabled.

Have you tried another server? It could be something
specific to the system exhibiting the problem. I recently
had a RAM module slowly degrade and it was causing
corruptions that really seemed like a network problem.
I replaced all sorts of network gear before finding the
REAL source...

Us too, we've been on Xitami for about 2.5 years too.
If turning FTP off does not solve the problem, I've got
another box to slot in ...

I've had FTP enabled. Just turned it off. Preliminary tests ok.

> why Xitami corrupts an EXE file on Download. HTTP.

Never does that for me. I stash huge self-checking EXE files
(Netscape 4.7, NT4 SP6a) on my server for local convenience. NT4SP6a
is over 30Megs and does a thorough self-check when run.

Xitami on various P133-P350 boxes, mostly NT4, mostly with 10-speed
net-cards to 100-speed switches to a 10-speed switch to a 10-speed
router, optic over to the library and then off into some Gigabyte
Cloud.

Yes, I have FTP enabled, turned-on, and use it. The FTP module is
weak, and a big FTP job will sometimes lock-up Xitami. But HTTP
hardly-ever burps as long as nobody has done a big FTP job today,
and I can't remember ever getting a corrupt HTTP download.

As others have suggested: there are cards with timing bugs, which
may not appear if there is a slower bottleneck along the path but
can corrupt packets if they try to run full-speed.

So far, turning off FTP has fixed the problem.  I have another box ready to go if there are more problems.
Xitami has been very good on my NT 4 Workstation SP6a. This 166mhz machine has been running over 3 -4 years,
with Xitami about the last 2 1/2 years.

Thank you everyone for your responses.

I know it sounds strange but older PCI video cards could also corrupt  
files on a LAN.  We spent 3 months determining that our LAN problems 
were caused by video drivers.  If you happen to be using an old PC 
because it runs Xitami just fine it could be along shot answer.  We 
serve on a T1 and haven't seen a problem with either FTP or HTTP, but we 
have very little traffic.

This describes me.

Hummmm ... The server is using an old Diamond Viper that came from my desktop machine.
But this is a brand new issue. The Viper has been in the box for a long time. 
I'll keep this in mind.

Since the war, we've been doing over 300mb a week. This is a record for us. It's why we up'd the speed,
and when the problem started occuring.

I'll keep that other box handy.

This appended thing is common my experience from all kinds of sites.
Haven't figure out why.  Think it has something to do with how IE stores the
download in the Temporary folders before copying it to where you want it.
Deleting the brackets doesn't seem to hurt anything.  It's not consistent
enough to catch the pattern.  Possibility may be downloading a file with a
duplicate name in the Temp folders.

Just a thought
Charles

I have noticed other servers doing something simular but they put the
[1] befor the extention where Xatimi puts it at the end.  I thought it
might be something with the temp folders also so I cleared out every
temp folder I could find and the downloaded programs folder and then
tried to download a file that I know I have not tried to download befor
and it still puts the [1] on the end.

want it. Deleting the brackets doesn't seem to hurt anything.  It's not
consistent enough to catch the pattern.  Possibility may be downloading
a file with a duplicate name in the Temp folders.

Just a thought

At the risk of being redundant, I was checking out an IE security exploit
(from a security site) and found out some disturbing things.

Since I maintain multiple profiles on this Win98SE machine, I don't
generally look in the "Temporary Internet Files" folder in C:\Windows
directory.  Each profile maintains its own Temp Folders and clearing them
from the IE option only clears that set of folders.  However, the corrupted
download files were found in the Windows/Temporary Internet Files folders.
Logging into the "NONE" account (hitting cancel at logon) didn't gain me
access to these folders.  Turns out, this account looks in "Local
Settings/Temporary Internet Files" folders.  It seems IE can store files in
both your current profiles Temp folder and the main one in c:\windows,
depending on who's scripting the code.

So to recap - you can find the "Temporary Internet Files" folder in:
c:\windows - general downloads
c:\windows\local settings - if you use profiles
c:\windows\profiles\(acctname)    - per each profile
in your sock drawer.

You cannot view any other Temp folder in windows but your own.  You will
need to manually clear some of them in DOS - changing the attrib and going
to each random named folder in Content.IE5 and erasing stuff.  I've found
that killing the appropriate "desktop.ini" file allows you to view that
folder's level in window and deleting it will kill everything under it.

Don't know if this helps you.  It bothers me.

Charles

Hello All:

I'm currently evaluating Xitami/Pro's SSL capabilities
for use with Win XP Home.  I've downloaded and setup
the trial certificate from Thawte, however, I'm still
not able to use the 'https' protocol.  ('Http' works
fine.)  Below is a snapshot of my logfile, and
everything seems OK.  By no means am I an expert in
this area.  Any input would be appreciated.  Thanks.

Thanks.  Tried Opera a long to ago.  It was fine.  Just windows didn't play
well with it.  The newer versions feel a little bloated and slower than the
original and didn't do anything for me.  And my windows still wouldn't play
fair.

I usually avoid nasties by being careful where I stick my disk.

I would not say that.  True that Netscape and Opera does not do it and IE
does but IE does not do it with other web servers.  Now if it is a problem
with IE then we all know how that will go.
"Hello MS.  Your browser has a problem with Xatimi web server".
"Then you should use our web server (IIS)."

Message-ID: <BAY1-F102fWXWzRPTNZ000393d5@hotmail.com>

  Hello all,

  How do you get Xitami to serve more than one site each with their own 
domain name?  If I own abc.com  and cba.com, can I serve them both from one 
instance of Xitami?  I know I've seen something similar to this discussed 
here, but I admit that I am a little slow at understanding some things.  
Thanks for any help with this! Have a good day!

What error do you get from your browser when you
try to connect using HTTPS ?

If you are running behind a firewall of some sort,
one thing to check is that 443 port for HTTPS is not
being blocked.

. . . the window.open() function has been replaced with new Object().

Has anyone seen or solved this problem?

	Xitami likes caching pages. Maybe you had new Object() in teh past, and it is
serving the cached page ? Try stop/start of Xitami, see if it goes away.

	The Java you have installed has nothing to do with Javascript. Their syntaxes
may be somewhat similar, and same goes for the name, but they are separate
things. You don't need to have a Java VM installed to run Javascript.

	You will notice that Microsoft uses the name JScript, or the more "politically
correct" ECMAScript.

	Anyway, Xitami should be simply serving a static HTML without changing its
bytes, so I bet it's a caching problem as indicated in my previous email. If not
Xitami, maybe your browser is caching an old page.

Thanks Marcio. I have stopped and started Xitami. I have quit IE and 
restarted. I have pressed Cntrl-F5 in IE. Still the same problem.

Is this by any chance a problem with me accessing the web-server on the 
same machine? I am using a virtual host and have this name resolving to 
127.0.0.1 in the hosts file.

	The *scripting engine* does make a difference in the way Javacript runs in IE.
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/downloads/list/webdev.asp


	Other packages may upgrade the Javacript scripting engine. Upgrading your
browser from 5.0 to 5.5 for example may do that. Maybe upgrading the Microsoft
Java VM may do that (also upgrade the scripting engine on your back).


	But upgrading the SUN Java VM does not change the way Javascript runs in IE.

	The first thing I would do is to sniff the network packets to see who is not
telling the truth - Xitami or the web browser. One sniffer that I use is
http://www.analogx.com/contents/download/network/pmon.htm , but unfortunately it
does not seem to be able to sniff packets on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1),
only on a real network card. So, you may have to test with Xitami on a separate
machine. Or easier - simply telnet to port 80, and issue a GET command and see
what Xitami answers.

	You can also install PWS (Personal Web Server) or another free web server and
test the same page, just to compare.

	Also, make sure you are not running a pop-up killer. These programs sniff the
HTTP replies and change the HTML on-the-fly to kill pop-ups.

Yes. You need to set up a "virtual host" for each domain name. If you use
the Xitami Web Based Admin functionality, it is pretty easy to set up a
virtual host.

Subject: [Xitami] Persistent CGI, anyone interested ?
Message-ID: <001201c323b8$51a4df20$0203a8c0@celeron2k>

Hi,

	As some of you know, if you want a web app integrated with your web server you
have to either make it into a CGI program that is loaded/unloaded everytime your
URL is hit, or you must have a persistent (always running) server that sits
behind Xitami (or Apache) so that this process is sped up.

	As you know, doing this under Apache is specific to Apache, and doing this for
Xitami is specific to Xitami too (LRWP). If you use Java servlets then you are
fine because both Apache and Xitami can run servlets in a persistent manner (the
Sokrates folks have implemented the LRWP for you).

	Now, if you want to do something in another language (say Python) and want to
have the interpreter pre-loaded and already running, a portable alternative
would be Fast CGI
(http://www.fastcgi.com/devkit/doc/fastcgi-whitepaper/fastcgi.htm), but that
involves supporting their protocol too, which is not super simple.


	What I did was a portable, small executable, that implements a persistent CGI
in the simplest possible way. You use it like this:

	http://localhost/cgi-bin/pcgi


	The executable is launched, and it reads a cfg file that tells what host & port
the actual server is running. Then it forwards all the CGI environment variables
to it, and waits for bytes from it and forwards these to the original requestor.
So, it acts like a middle-man. Like this:


   HTTP          +-------------+
+---------------+
<--------------> | web server  | <---> (pcgi is exec'ed) <----> |  your server
|
                 +-------------+
+---------------+



	The idea is that pcgi is a lot faster to launch for every URL that is
requested, at least faster than your whole web app. That is so because pcgi.exe
is just 58KB. So, this allows it to be loaded fast, and then you can have your
persistent server always running, behind either Apache or Xitami.

	Anyway, if you are interested in using this please contact me. The source code
is Open Source, and compiles under Linux, Windows, etc. In fact it will compiler
under all platforms supported by SmartEiffel
http://smarteiffel.loria.fr/index.html

	Here's an example output of a persistent web app that simply echo's the env
vars back, if you use the URL http://localhost/cgi-bin/pcgi?foo=bar

Message-ID: <02eb01c32425$8243b0d0$6902a8c0@reet>

I had forgotten I was subscribed to this list :)

So I've been having this problem forever, I'm probably doing something
wrong.. I'm hoping someone can help me out.

I generate demographics for my domains using Webalizer, unfortunatley the
demographics server is a windows machine, so webalizer won't do reverse-DNS
(only works in the unix version)

Xitami has a reverse DNS setting in the 'logging' configuration.. but for
the life of me I can't get it to work at all.

I've enabled reverse-DNS, entered my DNS servers, nothing happens, logfiles
are still recording IPs, no hostnames.

This is happening on several machines .


Any help would be much appreciated !

Thanks,
Josh

I'm running a Xitami webserver which works great. Xitami just cranks 10
sites along no problem. I'm now trying to do some Intranet. I have set up a
site on the webserver but when I type in the site it looks out on the
internet for it. I have also put in an IP in the DNS server. However when I
type in that page it looks to the Internet instead of the Intranet. How do I
keep from trying to go out to the web?

I have a site set up on an intranet.  The server name is zeus, so I 
simply type:

http://zeus/name

into the address input of IE or Opera and up it comes.

What operating system are you running?

If it's Windows <something> then you probably need to set up a HOSTS file in
your c:\windows directory  (there should be a sample hosts.sam there
already -- copy to hosts [no extention]).

Create an entry in the file that identifies the name of your server and it's
internal IP address, for example:

192.168.0.100   MyIntranetServer

Reboot your system and try pointing your web browser to
http://MyIntranetServer and see what happens.

Good luck.

Message-ID: <2467401.1054065454734.JavaMail.Administrator@atp>

Xitami's been running perfectly for a couple of years. But now I got a new
laptop, and I cannot get it to work again.

Version is 2.5b5, same as before. Ping 127.0.0.1 works. Perl is up &
running, same as before. 

I can use the URL http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/test.cgi and the script runs &
displays the web page. But if I try
http://www.thunting.com/cgi-bin/test.cgi, it does not work.

I have created a virtual host entry for www.thunting.com, which includes
Webpages = "c:\\thunting" and Cgi-bin="c:\\thunting\\cgi-bin".

This has gotta be OE, and easy to fix. Help!

Thanks,
Carl

I thought you hit on something there but that didn't work either. I'll
double check everything to insure I don't have any typos anywhere. It does
come up when I type the IP it's just not resolving the name.

Ok it worked with www.name but didn't work with just http://name. I'm fine

Hello !

Use the ip address of the server, like
http://123.123.123.123

If this still don't work, then your network is not configured correctly.

Try:

tracert zeus

and

tracert 123.123.123.123

from the cmd prompt (or use ping).

This command works always ... if your network is configured correctly.

If the command works, but your browser is set to use a gateway, it will try 
to connect to the gateway.
In internet explorer, go to Tools, Internet Options, Connections tab, LAN 
settings, select "bypass proxy for local addresses" and in advanced select 
the local range.

That's not enough, you will need to have a dns entry pointing to your laptop.
Contact your isp if he's doing your dns.
Easy way is to change the local ip address to the one of the former server.

Thanks Marcio. I have stopped and started Xitami. I have quit IE and 
restarted. I have pressed Cntrl-F5 in IE. Still the same problem.

Is this by any chance a problem with me accessing the web-server on the 
same machine? I am using a virtual host and have this name resolving to 
127.0.0.1 in the hosts file.

An easier way is to edit the HOSTS file. Add an entry that reads 
127.0.0.1            www.thunting.com
(or local.thunting.com or whatever) and it will work. The HOSTS file 
is located in 
[windows directory]\system32\drivers\etc

This only works for outgoing connections. All external incoming connections
will be routed to his former server.

Hello,

I was just looking at the incoming and outgoing logs on my router, and I 
see lots of weird requests going to and from the webserver system.  For 
example, there are lots of requests from multiple IP addresses in the 
198.81.26.xxx range, and although most of those requests are coming IN 
on port 80, it looks like Xitami is sending OUT replies on some crazy 
port numbers, like 36045 and 47439.

What's going on here?  Is this cause for concern?

Thanks,

Jon

I just want to use Xitami to test web scripts while off-line. When on-line
(this is a laptop) I want to access the real thunting.com. The hosts file
currently has

127.0.0.1 localhost

which I think is all I need for local loopback. Question is, how do I get
Xitami to sub 127.0.0.1 for www.thunting.com, when I'm off-line? This worked
fine before, but I'm missing something now.

Not good.

Apropos of which it's useful to understand just HOW Internet Explorer
handles downloads: despite the appearance of a dialogue box asking the
user to decide whereabouts to put the downloaded file, IE always
downloads the file into whatever is defined (in the Registry[1]) as the
place for "Temporary Internet Files".  Only on completion of the download
is the file copied (or moved, if on the same volume) to the destination
selected by the user.

Supremely stupid behaviour (especially if the user knows that there is
insufficient space on the default TEMP volume and hopes to avoid running
out of space: vainly) but, hey!, that's Microsloth for you.

[1] I can't remember whether the TEMP environment variable can override
this, or whether it's vice versa.

Any other recommendations? I forgot to mention, old system ran Win2000, new
system is XP... any difference here? I desperately need to get this working.

does your domain name registrar point to this domain name?
Static IP.
If dynamic, how do you point the domain name to an IP?

I'm trying to get this working for off-line script debugging, so the domain
name registration should not be relevant. When I'm on-line, and not using
Xitami, http://www.thunting.com/cgi-bin/test.cgi works fine (sorry, had to
re-upload it). When off-line, http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/test.cgi works, but
http://www.thunting.com/cgi-bin/test.cgi does not. I do have a virtual host
entry for www.thunting.com.

One suggestion was to add "127.0.0.1 www.thunting.com" to my hosts file.
This does make the off-line debugging work, but it also forces the browser
to use my local scripts even when on-line, which is what I expected. In
other words, it hard-wires www.thunting.com to 127.0.0.1. I do not want
this, and did not have it on the old system.

BTW, I am trying a fresh install os a Win2000 PC, getting the same results,
which convinces me it is simple OE. Just don't know what to try.

Regards,
Carl

P.S. -- here are my cfg files:

defaults.cfg:

Hello !

I don't think you could make Windows that intelligent.
When resolving a name, windows first looks in the hosts file for hard coded 
addresses, then try a dns and/or wins query (depending on how your system 
is configured). I don't think you could reverse the search order, that is 
look in the host file when there is no network present. (even if windows is 
able to "sense" the presence of a network connection).

Subject: [Xitami] New to Xitami & running xbase++ CGI's
Message-ID: <000001c32716$5fbecf10$817ba8c0@brent>

Hi all:

 I've migrated my OS from W2K Pro where I used IIS to XP home which
unfortunately doesn't ship with IIS [ good old Bill ].

 I've heard and seen a lot of good news and hi commendations for Xitami
..so here I am.

 I can get Xitami to run my HTML..no problem.

 I use Alaska xBase++ code compiled to produce a 32 bit CGI exe. It has
worked great under IIS, but now under Xitami, I can't get them to light
up.
 Yes I 've read the help files and they where fine..to a point and I've
done a quick scan of the archives of this group, but nothing expressly
addresses my issues.

 FIRST: The config on the Xitami install doesn't create a CGI-BIN
directory as advertised in the admin and help files. There's a CGI-SRC
though. No big deal I created one. An oversight I thought ?.
 SECOND:
    I loaded my dll's and exe's into this directory [ c:\xitami\cgi-bin
] = 500 error
 so I loaded ........................................[
c:\xitami\webpages\cgi-bin ] = 500 error
 and a few other perms and combs' all with the same result. = 500 error.
  Even tried adding a 'MZ' prefix to the dll's and exe's.. No luck there
either.

 I think someone has to "lead me by the throat" .

 From the default installation..where do I place my code so it will run
?? And any other issue I should know about when running a Windows 32 bit
app as a CGI ?

 Many thanks for the help..
