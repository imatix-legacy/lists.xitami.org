Hi guys,

Encountered the following issues after installing the 2.4d9 release on a PC
running W2K server:

1.    cgi-bin folder was not installed.
2.    SSI does not work.
3.    Retart function under 127.0.0.1/admin does work.  After clicking
restart, the page responded with restarting but server will not restart.

Help!

Thanks
Peter

Ok...first newbie issue for me..

ver. 2.5b4
Win98 environment
DSL, dynaminc IP with DNS update, lyksys router, ports to server forward =
and working

Xitami established fine out of the box, web-admin no problem and served =
a site by just dropping the folder into the "webpages" directory.  FTP =
came on fine referring to the standard dirctories and cgi's run fine =
with no issues.  All seems well, let's try the vhost wizzard and see if =
we can offer a user to ftp into the vhost. =20

Check the docs, faq on xitami site, 42 says...=20

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------

42: I want each user to have FTP access to their personal web pages =20

You do not need aliases. Simply assign each user a subdirectory of the =
webpages directory, then specify this directory as their FTP home =
directory (using a full path).=20



-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------


I crank up the vhost wizzard and set the FTP root to point absolute to =
the subdirectory "web5", which in turn has been pointed to generate =
under "webpages".  I hit the "create" button and bingo, it's all there.  =
I call up the vhost administrator and can see the references and the =
permissions appear as I would expect.

                            web5 - FTP User Profiles=20

      User name: Password: Login directory: Permissions: Space used =
(Mb): Number of files:=20
      admin admin c:\program files\xitami\webpages\web5/ * 0 0=20
      anonymous  * c:\program files\xitami\webpages\web5/pub/ G 0 0=20
      ftp  * c:\program files\xitami\webpages\web5/pub/ G 0 0=20
      guest    c:\program files\xitami\webpages\web5/guest/ G 0 0=20
      upload  upload c:\program files\xitami\webpages\web5/upload/ P 0 0 =





So I fire up the FTPclient and point to www.XXX.XXX/web5, logging =
admin/admin and I end up at  the FTP root whith Pub, Guest and Upload.

So I try reauthenticating into upload, using upload/upload, send a file, =
hoping it routes to web5, but it lands in upload.

Have I missunderstood what FAQ 42 is trying to tell me?  Can someone =
please embarass me?

You haven't created a pipedef.xml file :-)

It's optional.  See the documentation if you want to know what you can
do with it.

When did this change? When I first got Xitami (latest beta,) it had it in
there.  After I trashed my hard drive and downloaded Xitami, it did not have
it in there.

Subject: [Xitami] More Pipedef stuff
Message-ID: <000901c1ab2a$c4185670$7200a8c0@DOCS4A>

I just took a look at the 2.5b5 docs and it states that if you want to
define your own, to rename pipedef.xml.  I checked my download, and this
file
is not in the current download at all.  With me not being a programmer, I am
quite hesitant to create something that I haven't got a clue.

In reference to my earlier post, I believe I had downloaded 2.5b4 which had
the pipedef file.


Thanks

Les

Hi Ewen,

Thanks for helping, what is the function of this pipedef.xml and which
documentation are you refering to?

Thanks

After installing xitami server and activeperl I can run scripts ok but I
can't use perl in a dos box to check syntax (perl -c scriptname). I get
a "This Program cannot be run in DOS mode" message. All I really want to
be able to do on my home WIN98 system is check script syntax before
sending to the unix server and testing against real files and data. Can
anyone help me with this please?.

Isn't Win9x fun?

-How- are you opening a "DOS box"? Usually: Start, Run, "command", OK will
open a proper 32-bit command window. "Command Prompt" may (should) also work. 
Shelling out of a 16-bit editor is sure to give you a 16-bit DOS environment
that lacks many functions.

Also- since you have a web server and Perl on the Win98 machine, you could
stash your Perl script in the cgi-bin folder, open a browser, open
"http://localhost/cgi-bin/doodah.pl", and check functionality. That isn't much
use if you've made a big syntax error though. 

Use this on top of your scripts. If you make a not too big syntax error, this
will try to tell you about it.

Hello to everyone.

I have had Xitami 2.5b5 running for over a year now and first I must say it
has been a joy to use. Actually all I had to do was install it, made some
html and after that, just forget about it. No need to check every day if my
pages were alive. They truly have been. Including FTP.

I have registered two domain names at mydomain.com. They are ???.net and the
other one is ???andwhatnot.com. I have ADSL connection with static IP. So my
both domains point to same IP-address. Is it possible to make Xitami to
separate these domain names and guide the visitors to sites (in this case
two different folders on same HD) they are looking for or do I have to set
up a DNS-server or something else? I've tried to use virtual hosts but I
just couldn't make it work. Maybe I haven't just got it right...

 So, in short. Two domain names pointing to same IP and in Xitami I have two
different folders for two different domains. How can I make this work?


Best regards

Open the /admin screens, use the Virtual Host Wizard. Associate
the DNS names with a config file which will point to the
directory you want served for that hostname.

Subject: [Xitami] vhost frustrations
Message-ID: <011801c1ac99$85d3ab60$6501a8c0@ameritech.net>

Gentlemen,

I have gone through the configs pages, the vhost pages, the faq, xitami
archives and global net searches, as well as debug reporting, trying to get
the limited /setup vhwba to access a test vhost and have failed with every
attempt now for days.  Does this function even  work?

I'm running 2.5b4, DSL pppoe, through a lynksys router through IE5.5 with
http/1.1 enabled.
This is a dynamic IP.  DNS is functioning and I update the dns reflection
through a ddns client.  The translation to the server for typical HTTP and
FTP access has worked fine, with ftp directed explicitly to the site sub
directory, below webpages.

For this mail, I refer to a fictitious address being
http://www.hysted.mine.nu as my host url.

During vhost wizard creation, I have allowed the default dns to be acquired
for the "Or, enter DNS host name" field with the profile hostname as
"vhost1" .cfg

Webpage root directory was explicit from drive root, using forward slash
method to /vhost1
FTP was set explicit from drive root, using forward slash method to /vhost1

VH WBA is checked to indicate use of the limited WBA

And user id as "vh1user" and password as "vh1pass"

The "create" was confirmed and the server restarted, just to be sure.

In the resultant profile under vhost, security, passwords, I select the
/setup protected uri and instead of "vh1user" and "vh1pass", I have "admin"
and "-".  So I figure this is to avoid "defaults" in administration
profiles.


I convert the user from "admin" to "vh1user" and the password from "-" to
"vh1pass"
I exit through consecutive "saves", restart the server, and check the cfg
and aut files next, they follow here:


vhost1.cfg
-----------------------
#*END

[Accesslog]
    Filename = "vhost1.log"

[Ftp]
    Root = "c:/program files/xitami/webpages/vhost1"

[Security]
    Filename = "vhost1.aut"

[Server]
    Webpages = "c:/program files/xitami/webpages/vhost1"

[Wsx]
    Admin = ""
____________________________


vhost1.aut
----------
#*END

[/admin]
    Admin = "-"

[/setup]
    Vh1user = "vh1pass"
______________________________

As far as I can see, I should be able to hit this vhost from the browser in
the /setup realm using

http://www.vh1user@vhost1.hysted.mine.nu/setup

I expect to see an authentication show up under "/setup" realm where
"vh1user" and "vh1pass" will enable the limited VH WBA.

I get back IE5's 404 page cannot be found

I try to hit http://www.hysted.mine.nu./vhost1/ and I get the /vhost1/
directory...no problem

I try http://www.hysted.mine.nu./vhost1/setup and I get the IE5 404 cannot
be found again.

I setup the server to log debug files, empty the log files and repeat the
call to http://www.vh1user@vhost1.hysted.mine.nu/setup
I cycle the logs immediately and check the debug files:

Oddly, when I hit the same url with http://www.hysted.mine.nu./vhost1/admin,
It hits the "admin" realm and awaits authentication, which is disabled of
course.

Can anybody help with this?  I've been trying for over a week with other
various configurations and I'm getting exasperated.

Thank you in advance.

I am running 2.4d6 under Windows NT4 SP5 and notice that a reset of the
system is necessary to make a new vhost actually work. Stopping and
starting Xitami doesn't activate the new vhost.

It must be the Xitami version I am running.  Anyone else notice this quirk
with 2.4d6 or any other version ?

Also, there is no way to delete the vhosts using http admin with that
version.

This may be a dumb question, but here goes...

If the second domain is on another computer (comp. 2) and addressed that way
in the configs (on comp. 1), will the script(s)(in this case php/MySQL) use
the processor, MySQL, php compiler, etc. in the first computer (comp. 1)
with Xitami on it or the second computer (comp. 2)) that does not have
Xitami on it.

I have been running Xitami since last year and had NO problems at all, but
my needs are now growing to the point that I need a faster drive, faster
processor, more memory, etc.  I feel the need for speed.

Logic tells me that all of the processing would still be done on the
computer 1.  And if I want more speed I will have to switch everything over

Subject: [Xitami] Two domain names.

Hello to everyone.

I have had Xitami 2.5b5 running for over a year now and first I must say it
has been a joy to use. Actually all I had to do was install it, made some
html and after that, just forget about it. No need to check every day if my
pages were alive. They truly have been. Including FTP.

I have to agree.  I have, been running Xitami Powered for over 4 years, on a
M$ Operating to say the least! ;-0   I have found over the final OS switch
to a flavor of UNIX, LINUX, xBSD.

I have ADSL connection with static IP. So my
both domains point to same IP-address. Is it possible to make Xitami to
separate these domain names and guide the visitors to sites (in this case
two different folders on same HD) they are looking for or do I have to set
up a DNS-server or something else? I've tried to use virtual hosts but I
just 

Ok here is how I do it and it works, and one thing I have to say before I
tell you is that, it is here at the Xitami Support Forum from great people I
have learned to achieve this.  Another STRONG feature from Imatix! 
-----remember this is just one way to set it up, there are many solutions
and alternatives, I am just telling you the way I have it setup and it works
 

1st:  You have the DSL connection and the Static IP, (The best start you
could ask for), even if you had a block of addresses, it is still better to
bind & multi-home all your Virtual Hosts to one IP, I mean the IP system as
Area codes and phone numbers are running their course.

2nd-Solution-A: Set up a box with FreeBSD (again, there are many available
solutions, I do not want to start a OS war here).  This will be for your
name server.  You will also need 2 more IP's Static for the Name Server. 
Just ask your uplink to provide you with some.  There is rarely a cost
associated with getting more IP's, you just need a valid reason for usage, a
name server is a very valid reason.
!!-This is the most effective solution-!!

2nd-Solution-B:  Have someone do your name server (DNS).  Point of the
matter is, the more control you have of your OWN name server the better. 
There are people that will do it for you, the question is, are they
available to update a name server when ever YOU want, and then at what cost?
If you are interested in this solution, we www.thecomputerdojo.com can
provide this service for you for 9.99 per month.  It is cheaper than buying
another machine and dealing with your uplink trying to get IP's, (some
uplinks charge for extra IP's).

3rd:  Setup a box for Xitami using whatever operating system.  I myself
still run my Xitami Web Server on the M$ Platform.  I am sure some people
will think this is a mistake and would suggest running under some flavor of
UNIX/LINUX.
Bind this machine to the static IP you choose.

4th:  Setup name server with A-Name and C-name, you can do MX resolutions
too, Deerfield 
has a great Mail Daemon   www.mdaemon.com

5th: Now that you have all that setup, the easy part is dealing with Vhosts.
 Here is how you do it.  Go into Xitami Setup, click on Virtual Hosts, click
on NEW:


Create virtual host profile:   .cfg extension is assumed 
stick to the actual domain name, for example: cybercoalition

Overwrite existing?   
ALWAYS!



Select IP address:   All addresses (recommended)209.5.45.142127.0.0.1 
do not change

Or, enter DNS host name:   
here you would put  www.cybercoalition.com




Web page root directory:  
Here you put the path eg: webpages/cybercoalition 
CGI-bin directory:  
best to make separate cgi-bin directories eg:
webpages/cybercoalition/cgi-bin

FTP root directory:  
I use WAR_FTP, was not happy with Xitami's FTP server for what I run.  For a
stand alone webserver FTP it's alright.

Create directories if necessary?  
Absolutely

Superuser password:  
anything you want

Uses shared logfiles?  
Up to you, I make separate, do not want everyone sharing log files.

Can use Browser-Based Admin?  
again, up to you.....

If so, user id:  
anything

and password:  
anything


Now restart the server and exit....




So, in short. Two domain names pointing to same IP and in Xitami I have two
different folders for two different domains. How can I make this work?


see above......  ;-)

Hope this helps you out....

Best regards

Hogan

Thanks for the advice. I can get it to work running perl from the Start Menu as
you suggest. Can't get a DOS box to do the same yet even though the shortcut runs
the same "c:\windows\command.com" program. Think I'll take a look at the PIF
parameters for this...but I can now check out my scripts using the perl syntax
checker...
Thanks again.

On my server machine, I had to set my TCP/IP address, host name, domain, dns
primary, secondary and DHCP manually. ( the linksys acquire will usually be
dynamic however) (ADSL)

For one cable client using linksys, we had to follow the linksys help file
for mac address ghosting, which requires a trip to the dos prompt, (assuming
windows), and generate the mac ghost overlay, then input it to linksys.
(motorola cable-modem).  Using the labled mac address from the modem did no
good here. (we could ping but not surf.) This fixed it.

I also forwarded all the noted addresses in the linksys forward page, then
closed up those not needed, as I could disprove them. (make sure your
pointing to the manually configured server ip address for forwarding).  DMZ
was not neccessary nor is it advisable.

If you force a network browser to a full www url, pointing to your page, do
you get out and back in from your own request generation, (that is
www.mypage.whatever as opposed to using the network nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn address?

Maybe do some port scanning from a third party on the net and see what
status is showing up on various ports.

Good luck.
Mike

Most cable ISPs are now blocking port 80 incoming, but not FTP (21). So
you'll need to change your port base for HTTP.

BTW, if you've set the computer running Xitami as DMZ it is wide open, and
you don't need to, and shouldn't, forward any ports to it. DMZ means all
incoming requests are directed to DMZ IP address.

As the other responder mentioned, a DMZ setup is inadvisable. Better to not
use DMZ and just forward the necessary incoming ports to the Xitami
machine's IP address.

I did setup the machine containing the web server for manual TCP/IP (static)
192.168.1.2 and included the cable DNS's, and domain name. No help there.

I see in the router the area for mac address ghosting, and with a
ipconfig/all in cmd window the mac address or the cable modem is revealed.
Is this what I put into the router and is that called mac ghost overlay?

I'll promptly stop DMZ as you suggest and continue to forward 21, 80 and 81
to 192.168.1.2. Is this correct?

If I browse the www.myurl.com from my network, it works fine, but not from
the internet. So perhaps the mac address ghosting is the critical element
here.

Mike,

In looking at RR terms, I found this: "You are prohibited from excessive
consumption of resources, including CPU time, memory, disk space and session
time. You may not use resource-intensive programs, which negatively impact
other customers or the performance of Road Runner systems or networks. Road
Runner reserves the right to terminate or limit such activities."

They don't specifically say they block port 80, but..
The commercial accounts that they talk about not allowing are on the user's
personal page that is on their servers.

Jim
 -----Original Message-----

  I just contacted RoadRunner and they said, no they don't block port 80,
but residential accounts don't permit web servers. So, don't know if I'm
getting the straight answer or not. Can't tell if I should beleive them or
not.

Mike,

You can go to the Linksys website http://www.linksys.com "services and
support", "knowledge base" and search for "mac address clone"

Basically, you run "winipcfg" from the start/run menu (on the server) and
you will see you your ip config data.  Select the dropdown to point to the
card your accessing by, and you should see the "adapter address" listed
first.  Write that 12 digit number down. (if your running NT, you'll need to
go dos prompt and type "winipcfg /all"

Now, call up the Linksys and go to the "setup" area  see where it says WAN
IP address?  Write that down in case you have to revert.  Now select the
"advanced" tab then the "mac addr clone" tab.  Type in the 12 digit from the
winipcfg session and confirm it.  When you call up the setup tab again, you
should see the hardware address of the netcard as the wan ip address.  You
may have to do a reset on the router, I'm not sure.

Root around on linksys' web sight and be patient.  Work through logically
and use "ping" to tell you if your getting through at all.

Mike

    I have an internal Mandrake/Apache behind a Linksys. No DMZ, just port
forwarding (port 80).

    I also use www.dhs.org to have a symbolic name that I can give to
people, which points to my Linksys IP. So, when they use http://.... it will
go to my internal Linux.

    Of course the symbolic name does not work internally (intranet) because
it will point to teh Linksys, and I end up in teh Linksys admin. So, it will
only work from teh outside. Internally I use teh IP http://192.168.3.200

    I never cfg'ed DNS etc.

On Xitami 2.4xx it is /admin, not /setup.

If 2.5 is different, sorry for the interruption.

Seems very odd to me, to the point that I'd wonder about one of those viruses
that hijacks the run commands. But maybe it is normal for Win98. I'm afraid I
am no help on what is or isn't normal for Win9x.

Thanks Paul,

"/Admin" and "/Setup" are both created as protected uri's in 2.5 vhost
wizard and the docs seem to suggest that /setup will provide a "limited" vh
wba, whereby vhosted clients can make "limited" setup changes to their own
accounts remotely, using the xitami interface.  This is obviously an
attractive feature to be able to offer to vhost clients, as well as a
marketing tool for those of us who would wish to propel clients into a
commercial relationship with Xitami, where we would demo the product and
move them to purchase from Xitami and assist them under our deployment.

Every time I try to reference the url, either internally or externally, even
by way of  "host@" under http/1.1, I end up at the Xitami default page, as
if I need to have a local DNS "host" record for the vhost url to access, to
get to the vhost "/setup" realm.  When I try to access the vhost via the
"/admin", I end up in the admin realm, but the only authorization it
recognizes is my own Xitami master host permission.

Are there no users utilizing this convention or am I simply misunderstanding
the application of it, or is it not implemented yet?

You are the first to even try to respond to the many references I've left in
the archive, regarding this endeavor.  Thank you for responding Paul.



Is this perhaps a new convention to xitami which is not yet full
implemented?

I have been using xitami for about 2 weeks.  All of a sudden I have started
receiving the tcp_error message.  My network has not changed.  Not all
computers are receiving the message.  I can change the web server's IP and
it will work; however I need to keep the orignal IP.  This error is not
affecting all computers.
Thanks for your help.

They do not specifically block port 80. They will not provide support and if
they find out (by means of a complaint) they will require you to get a
business account.

A friend of mine was running a mail server and forgot to block relaying and
got busted by RR and they required him to get the upgraded account.

I am having a similiar problem except I can get some traffic through and
some cannot get through. Certain people can get on anytime they want and
certain people cannot ever get on. At the same time.

At first I thought it was Earthlink DSL but they do not block port 80. They
do not prohibit running a website but do not support it in any fashion
except for the original hookup.

I setup a laptop and tested it from home. The certain people could not get
on. I took the laptop over to a friends house with RR and it worked like a
charm.

Still can't figure out what is the problem at home.

Mike,

In looking at RR terms, I found this: "You are prohibited from excessive
consumption of resources, including CPU time, memory, disk space and session
time. You may not use resource-intensive programs, which negatively impact
other customers or the performance of Road Runner systems or networks. Road
Runner reserves the right to terminate or limit such activities."

They don't specifically say they block port 80, but..
The commercial accounts that they talk about not allowing are on the user's
personal page that is on their servers.

Jim
 -----Original Message-----

  I just contacted RoadRunner and they said, no they don't block port 80,
but residential accounts don't permit web servers. So, don't know if I'm
getting the straight answer or not. Can't tell if I should beleive them or
not.

Also found out that with certain RR modems, you must use the MAC address

    Anyone can check connectivity online. You just need a Java-enabled
browser.

1) Go to http://www.visualware.com/visualroute/index.html

2) Click on Live Demo

3) Select a server (USA, Virginia works for me)

4) Enter the target URL or host name or IP.


    You can also click on SNAP on teh applet to open a TXT window with the
results, which I pasted below.

      Give me your URL and I can run VisualRoute and see who is blocking
port 80.

    I just contacted RoadRunner and they said, no they don't block port 80,
but residential accounts don't permit web servers. So, don't know if I'm
getting the straight answer or not. Can't tell if I should beleive them or
not.

      Is port 80 being blocked by your isp?

      Anybody have this sort of trouble before? After going to cable from
dialup, using a Linksys router, folks coming in on the internet can get to
my FTP, but not my HTTP.  I can get to my HTTP on the local network. Must be
the router. Have set the IP the Xitami server is on to DMZ, as well as added
forwarding for this IP for ports 21, 80 and 81. No go.

It didn't come up for me, but then again I don't have the software.
Could you take a look at http://12.224.45.151/  and see if the server is
working properly? I am on a cable modem too from ATT. Wife says at the
hospital that it won't come up. Weird.
 
Thanks

      Anybody have this sort of trouble before? After going to cable from
dialup, using a Linksys router, folks coming in on the internet can get to
my FTP, but not my HTTP.  I can get to my HTTP on the local network. Must be
the router. Have set the IP the Xitami server is on to DMZ, as well as added
forwarding for this IP for ports 21, 80 and 81. No go.

Thanks for everyone's support.  Many good thinks came out of this =
thread, and I must give credit to Jeff Hamplin for the final winning =
moves. He said to resolve the situation where an ISP is blocking port 80 =
(and they are at some RR locations, not all) the thing that's needed is =
to first set the base port for Xitami's HTTP to 9000. This will in =
effect make the port for HTTP be 9080 as Xitami adds 80 to your entry in =
that field. Notice it is by default a 0. Then add a forward to the =
router for 9080. Lastly, FTP always worked right from the start as RR =
was not blocking that. However when you tell Xitami to use 9000, you are =
also without knowing it telling Xitami the FTP port is 9021. You can =
enter an FTP port of -8979 to put your FTP port back to 21 and keep web =
at 9080. This is done by manually editing the Xitami default.cfg file =
and adding an entry:

[FTP]
   Port=3D-8979

That should be -8979  -- a negative number. 9000-8979=3D21


Thus users will still be able to access FTP the usual way, however for =
HTTP there is the requirement now to add the port to the URL

http://mikemcdaniel.dynu.com:9080

ftp://mikemcdaniel.dynu.com

Again, thanks for everyone's help.=20

I assume that the  gateway on your cable modem is 12.244.84.3.  It looks =
like ATT is blocking inbound traffic to your address.

        Anybody have this sort of trouble before? After going to cable =
from dialup, using a Linksys router, folks coming in on the internet can =
get to my FTP, but not my HTTP.  I can get to my HTTP on the local =
network. Must be the router. Have set the IP the Xitami server is on to =
DMZ, as well as added forwarding for this IP for ports 21, 80 and 81. No =
go.

Subject: RE: [Xitami] Linksys Router and Xitami


It didn't come up for me, but then again I don't have the software.  Could
you take a look at http://12.224.45.151/  and see if the server is working
properly? I am on a cable modem too from ATT. Wife says at the hospital that
it won't come up. Weird.

Thanks

It would be nice to see what the user actually sees though.  Relaying
the html and it loads as if it was not local.  then you would exactly
know.  Otherwise I guess you just e-mail a buddy and ask them to do a
quick check.

    Anyone can check connectivity online. You just need a Java-enabled
browser.
 
1) Go to http://www.visualware.com/visualroute/index.html
 
2) Click on Live Demo
 
3) Select a server (USA, Virginia works for me)
 
4) Enter the target URL or host name or IP.
 
 
    You can also click on SNAP on teh applet to open a TXT window with
the results, which I pasted below.

    Give me your URL and I can run VisualRoute and see who is blocking
port 80.

I just contacted RoadRunner and they said, no they don't block port 80,
but residential accounts don't permit web servers. So, don't know if I'm
getting the straight answer or not. Can't tell if I should beleive them
or not.

Is port 80 being blocked by your isp?

Anybody have this sort of trouble before? After going to cable from
dialup, using a Linksys router, folks coming in on the internet can get
to my FTP, but not my HTTP.  I can get to my HTTP on the local network.
Must be the router. Have set the IP the Xitami server is on to DMZ, as
well as added forwarding for this IP for ports 21, 80 and 81. No go.

Thanks. I went to the website and ran it from a different location. I picked
the one in Canada. These results show a perfect example of what I am up
against.

Yours made it through fine. Mine got stopped along the way which is exactly
what seems to happen to the ones that cannot get the pages to pull up.

    Anyone can check connectivity online. You just need a Java-enabled
browser.

1) Go to http://www.visualware.com/visualroute/index.html

2) Click on Live Demo

3) Select a server (USA, Virginia works for me)

4) Enter the target URL or host name or IP.


    You can also click on SNAP on teh applet to open a TXT window with the
results, which I pasted below.

http://12.224.45.151/ that it came through the east coast when the text
says the west coast... just wondering...

    Anyone can check connectivity online. You just need a Java-enabled
browser.
 
1) Go to http://www.visualware.com/visualroute/index.html
 
2) Click on Live Demo
 
3) Select a server (USA, Virginia works for me)
 
4) Enter the target URL or host name or IP.
 
 
    You can also click on SNAP on teh applet to open a TXT window with
the results, which I pasted below.

    Give me your URL and I can run VisualRoute and see who is blocking
port 80.

I just contacted RoadRunner and they said, no they don't block port 80,
but residential accounts don't permit web servers. So, don't know if I'm
getting the straight answer or not. Can't tell if I should beleive them
or not.

Is port 80 being blocked by your isp?

Anybody have this sort of trouble before? After going to cable from
dialup, using a Linksys router, folks coming in on the internet can get
to my FTP, but not my HTTP.  I can get to my HTTP on the local network.
Must be the router. Have set the IP the Xitami server is on to DMZ, as
well as added forwarding for this IP for ports 21, 80 and 81. No go.

I have a question on that program. If you go to the server in Hong Kong
to trace a server in the us.  It shows in the picture on mine
http://12.224.45.151/ that it came through the east coast when the text
says the west coast... just wondering...

    Anyone can check connectivity online. You just need a Java-enabled
browser.
 
1) Go to http://www.visualware.com/visualroute/index.html
 
2) Click on Live Demo
 
3) Select a server (USA, Virginia works for me)
 
4) Enter the target URL or host name or IP.
 
 
    You can also click on SNAP on teh applet to open a TXT window with
the results, which I pasted below.

I just contacted RoadRunner and they said, no they don't block port 80,
but residential accounts don't permit web servers. So, don't know if I'm
getting the straight answer or not. Can't tell if I should beleive them
or not.

Anybody have this sort of trouble before? After going to cable from
dialup, using a Linksys router, folks coming in on the internet can get
to my FTP, but not my HTTP.  I can get to my HTTP on the local network.
Must be the router. Have set the IP the Xitami server is on to DMZ, as
well as added forwarding for this IP for ports 21, 80 and 81. No go.

Could folks please adjust their posting habits?  This particular post was
over 27kB in length, and yet actually had much less than 1kB of new
content.  The rest was needlessly-repeated, many-times-previously-quoted
stuff, and then the whole bloody caboodle all over again in HTML (which
made that traceroute table "interesting", since each line of it resulted
in hundreds of bytes of &nbsp; sequences etc.).

<http://www.geocities.com/nnqweb/nquote.html>, whilst written with

The mailing list currently rejects posts bigger than 30KB in size.  In
view of the excessive quoting that is going on, I'm tempted to reduce
this even further.  Can anyone think of a good reason for allowing posts
bigger than 10KB?  (The 30KB was set to allow people to include
configuration examples; but generally they're best done as smaller
snippets anyway.)

Anyone who is actually seeking an answer should note that I pretty much
ignore anything with more than one or two levels of quoting out of hand;
the rest goes into my "to be answered when I get time" pile, and stays
there until either (a) someone else answers it or (b) I get time.

Trimming quotes to only the most appropriate portions is
_strongly_encouraged_.

I belong to many other lists too. It seems people just give up on
editing the headers and hit the delete key.  Create a filter for
incoming mail, then get a faster connection to the net. Worked for me.

I think restricting size down to 10kb is somewhat anal. Perhaps just
like you have it now and no attachments.  If anyone has attachments they
send them directly.

How do you know what port 80 is blocked when is says Analysis: IP
packets are being lost past network "AT&T ITS" at hop 13. There is
insufficient cached 
information to determine the next network at hop 14.

According to http://visualroute.visualware.com/ you port 80 is blocked
at hop 13. An ATT site. It did work for me either this time.

It didn't come up for me, but then again I don't have the software.
Could you take a look at http://12.224.45.151/  and see if the server is
working properly? I am on a cable modem too from ATT. Wife says at the
hospital that it won't come up. Weird.

I just contacted RoadRunner and they said, no they don't block port 80,
but residential accounts don't permit web servers. So, don't know if I'm
getting the straight answer or not. Can't tell if I should beleive them
or not.

Anybody have this sort of trouble before? After going to cable from
dialup, using a Linksys router, folks coming in on the internet can get
to my FTP, but not my HTTP.  I can get to my HTTP on the local network.
Must be the router. Have set the IP the Xitami server is on to DMZ, as
well as added forwarding for this IP for ports 21, 80 and 81. No go.

Port 80 has simply been blocked on your cable network.  I've had the same
problem.  I pulled my hair out trying to figure it out until I finally
forced tech support to admit the blockage.  Blocking port 80 have become
common since the introduction of the code red type virus's that cripple ISP
bandwidth's.  Try using port 8080......

How do you know what port 80 is blocked when is says Analysis: IP packets
are being lost past network "AT&T ITS" at hop 13. There is insufficient
cached
information to determine the next network at hop 14.

According to http://visualroute.visualware.com/ you port 80 is blocked at
hop 13. An ATT site. It did work for me either this time.

It didn't come up for me, but then again I don't have the software.  Could
you take a look at http://12.224.45.151/  and see if the server is working
properly? I am on a cable modem too from ATT. Wife says at the hospital that
it won't come up. Weird.

I just contacted RoadRunner and they said, no they don't block port 80, but
residential accounts don't permit web servers. So, don't know if I'm getting
the straight answer or not. Can't tell if I should beleive them or not.

Anybody have this sort of trouble before? After going to cable from dialup,
using a Linksys router, folks coming in on the internet can get to my FTP,
but not my HTTP.  I can get to my HTTP on the local network. Must be the
router. Have set the IP the Xitami server is on to DMZ, as well as added
forwarding for this IP for ports 21, 80 and 81. No go.

Most of us would appreciate it if you (and others) stopped posting in HTML
and trimmed quotes to a minimum -- regardless of our connection speeds. It
is just the right thing to do; other's apathy is a poor excuse.

More importantly, the people who provide this list service free of charge
have repeatedly requested the same.

Restricting the size is not being anal, it is being prudent when people so
regularly ignore sensible guidelines.

I just noticed this post. I went through this myself recently. Road
Runner as a company doesn't block port 80 but in some areas the local
cable connector company might. As far as web servers being prohibited on
RR, I have heard them say it is not allowed but have been unsuccessful
in locating any place in their agreement that says so. 
 
I have Cox Cable in Fairfax County, Northern Virginia just outside
Washington DC. In some areas of the county (including mine) port 80 is
blocked because they were having system overloads from that Code Red
problem last summer. Other parts of the county it is not blocked. I have
several Xitami servers running in friends homes around the county. I
have given up on using port 80 and use 443. My  DNS forwarding service (
http://www.dns2go.com ) gives you the ability to change the port of a
domain preceded with the www. I think that the Xitami service also
allows this but am not sure. Hope this gives some more info.

	An HTML MIME message comes in an alternate envelope which also includes the TXT
piece. One possible workaround is to extract the first TXT piece and throw away
HTML's. This way HTML e-mail is automatically discarded, and just the txt part
survives.

	Maybe listservers have this option already ?

	The problem is when e-mail starts in HTML, then replies will probably come in
HTML too. And in these cases it can be hard to clip pieces, depending on your
e-mail program.

	Plain TXT e-mail should be fine for this list.

Ya know, watching the threads that are running here, leaves me shaking my
head.

List operators have the ability to obtain an agreement from those who would
join and take a responsible direction toward educating their users, in
support of the product base their working to expand.  This, as opposed to
open or direct dialog which serves to show their public flames, brow beating
and criticizm, from those who moderate the service and supposedly are there
to propel the product's growth and help the users.

A service can easily automate moderation criteria and react with warnings,
education and even soft or hard ban's on users who fail to comply, without
ever taxing the moderation group, other than to establish it initially.
Even teenagers have been able to handle the concept in ICQ and other public
forums.

If the list group were to sponser a venue for users to have online
interaction, they could provide a forum for off-topic dialog which could
work to Xitami's benefit, strengthening their shareware base and evolving
into commercial sales.  As well, the technology could be an implementation
to Xitami, further touting it's already robust package.

I've been tempted to introduce the product into my customer base, because of
the ease of use and bredth of capability, however the exposure I continue to
see here, tells me those opportunities will have to wait awhile.  I'm sure
someone would gladly tell me "If you spend the money for a registration,
you'll get quality support."  I'm not conviced by what I'm seeing here and
those of us in sales understand it reflects on the corporate mentality as a
whole.  As well, we in shareware work hard, are patient and at times take
risks to help others develop a good product.  Consider these things
gentlemen, even if mid-scale integration is your bread and butter, this
server product has a strong potential, worth the professionalism of you who
develop it and those who apply it.  Your competition is probably having a
field day showing this list to customers.

If I'm over quota, would someone dig this out of the technical consultant's
bit bucket? {:-(

I'll get off my soap box now, thank you for your time.

Now now don't get your panties in a bunch. I merely mentioned that
putting a limit to 5 or 10 k was anal. Not the idea to limit the size.
As far as HTML e-mails, I don't send them and when I reply to them I
change the format. Must be an error on your computer.  Terrible buggers
esp when it comes to filtering spam.

Most of us would appreciate it if you (and others) stopped posting in
HTML and trimmed quotes to a minimum -- regardless of our connection
speeds. It is just the right thing to do; other's apathy is a poor
excuse.

More importantly, the people who provide this list service free of
charge have repeatedly requested the same.

Restricting the size is not being anal, it is being prudent when people
so regularly ignore sensible guidelines.

Whilst being a strong opponent of over-quoting, I don't believe there
should be any automatic restriction based on size (although obviously the
list doesn't want to be propagating the binary photograph of the poster's
dog that someone thoughtlessly attaches to their post).

What IS needed is some PERSONAL discipline on the part of some of the
posters: perhaps it is just that they've only ever used e-mail in the
context of an intra-office memo (at Ethernet speeds) --- they just "hit
reply", and then do nothing about trimming the quoted material, but leave
it in one congealing lump after their (sometimes few) words of wisdom.  

There really is NO need to quote the entirety of all the previous
messages in the thread. There is even less necessity to quote them all
underneath, totally out of context, especially when no one can see,
without a lot of guesswork and scrolling back and forth, just what "you
need to change the oojimaflip" implies.

Quote JUST enough to establish a context for your reply; if the reply is
just a single point, then cut out EVERYTHING apart from that point, and
put the quote UNDERNEATH it.  If replying to multiple points, do so one
at a time.  Configure your mailer so that it quotes previous messages in
this sort of style, with a "> " at the beginning of each line and an
attribution ("On such-and-such a date, so-and-so said:") above the quoted
text.

Oh, and DO quote SOMETHING; posts on a mailing list can arrive seriously
out of order, and often without the "clues" to thread them into context
automatically.

> Anyone who is actually seeking an answer should note that I pretty much
> ignore anything with more than one or two levels of quoting out of hand;

Sometimes it is necessary to retain some more levels (say where one
poster is refuting the answer given by one or two others to some original
question) but in general that is correct: one doesn't need the WHOLE
provenance of the question and the arguments.

When cutting out older material, ensure that the attribution is correct:
people get somewhat miffed if it's written that they said something that
they never had any hand in.

> the rest goes into my "to be answered when I get time" pile, and stays
> there until either (a) someone else answers it or (b) I get time.

Over-quoters please note the above: you are less likely to get a reply
from the very person with the greatest knowledge.  This will tend to
apply to other knowledgable people as well: they might not have time to
reconstruct the poster's thoughts out of the mess that is the stream-of-
consciousness in a big thread.

> Trimming quotes to only the most appropriate portions is
> _strongly_encouraged_.

Hear, hear.

The page <http://www.geocities.com/nnqweb/nquote.html> provides plenty
of justification for that point, and for the other matters I've raised.

The only other point is this nonsense of people writing in HTML.
Unfortunately, they often are blissfully unaware that it's happening.
Outlook Express and all the other "mailers" include a setting to
suppress this infelicity: sadly in some issues of the programs, the
default is to post in both ASCII and HTML.  That format can sometimes be
triggered when replying to such a message, under the control of another
setting.

If you can reject posts based on size, could you not do the same where
there's a "Content: multipart/alternative" in the MIME headers?

Anybody who has ever visited Microsoft server lists will find much 
more intense negative feedback and roaming discussions for their 
bug filled and insecure servers.  We are all in awe that Microsoft 
marketing can often overcome reality but if your clients are wise 
then they will naturally select Xitami over Microsoft and other 
servers.

If this Xitami list does anything it shows that there is an alternative 
to pain and suffering some people accept as necessary to operate 
a server.

To the list operators: maybe it will be a better alternative to use some 
sort of bulletin board (ultiboard is a good one) for postings. (example: 
http://www.powerbasic.com/support/forums/Ultimate.cgi). I once created such 
a bulletin board and it's easy to maintain.

Your mailbox is not flooded with mails you probably won't read, the threads 
are separated by subject.
When i first used a bulletin board, i didn't like the idea (impossible to 
attach documents, difficult to quote and edit text, ...) but after a while 
i began to appreciate the board.
You can get a notification whenever somebody respond to your posting and 
you can check the board whenever you want, not when you check your mail.
And you can create different forums for those who only work with 
windows/unix/mac/...

Message-ID: <20020206162314.23629.qmail@web14910.mail.yahoo.com>

This may have been discussed here before, but I'll ask anyway.  There
seems to be a problem with xitami and the $php_self variable.  It does not
correctly return the script name as it should.  I've read much about this
and I'm not the only one this happens to.  I'm wondering if anyone has
found a work-around for this or maybe even a solution?

thanks,
SHANE

I am also on Road Runner (Central Florida).  They told me they block =
port 80 nationwide.  I was never able to get port 80 to work.  =
Fortunately the tech I spoke with also runs a server from his home, and =
told me it could be done which made me persistant enough to find =
available ports.

I use dns2go ( www.dns2go.com - its free) handle my dynamic ip adress.  =
In the dns2go client, under the Service Settings tab, I checked =
"Redirect web requests (with a www prefix)" and picked "To my current IP =
address ont port:" and set it to 6080.

Then I edited my defaults.cfg file in my xitami directory to say:

#  Created at installation time
#
!  Loading defaults.cfg file...
[Server]
priority=3D1
portbase=3D6000
background=3D1
[FTP]
port=3D-5979
dataport=3D5800
user-file=3Dftpusers.aut
directory-file=3Dftpdirs.aut
[Security]
filename=3Ddefaults.aut

[Filter]
-php=3Dc:\PHP\php.exe

The stuff that matters is:

[Server]
portbase=3D6000  This sets the web server port to 6080 which is where =
dns2go directs it.

[FTP]
port=3D-5979    This brings the FTP server port back down to 21 (make =
sure to use -5979) as portbase is an offset (+80) for all ports
data-port=3D5800  this is actually a mistake, but it works for now.  I =
shoulda used -5800 cause my intent was to bring the FTP data port down =
to 200.  I have issues where some people have trouble connecting with =
FTP client software, but everyone can connect and log-in with IE, so I =
leave it alone out of laziness.  I found out later that xitami being set =
to data-port 200 was actually a type-o in the xitami.cfg file in my =
particular release.  It should start at 20.  So this should actually be =
set to -5980, then it should work with all FTP clients.

What this does:
dns2go forwards all www prefixed web requests to port 6080 so my url is =
still www.mydomain.com but, since www.prefixes are forwarded to that =
port my FTP address is just ftp://mydomin.com=20

I really don't think you are ever gonna get port 80 to work on Road =
Runner. =20

I also set up www.mydomain.dns2go.com (which is free too) to get =
everything working until all the dns servers pointed to dns2go so that =
www.mydomain.com would work.

Good Luck,

Jay Aldrich

Hello Melle,

My Outlook has always been and always will be set up to send in plain text.
Unfortunately, Outlook automatically responds to a html message with html.
I do not think there is a way to change it, other than to change the format
of each reply itself before you send it, as outlooks assumes that by
replying to an html-formatted email, it is replying to an html
preferred/capable email client.  Outlook also does not let you know if an
email is formatted in plain text or html unless you check the emails
properties or specifically check the email make sure that > symbols are in
front of the senders original post or it has bars in front of it.

I apologize in advance, but I will surely find it difficult to remember to
check each email's format before I reply to it.  I can however promise that
no html formatted emails will originate from me.

I checked the format of this response before I sent it, and according to
Outlook it is plain text before it left me.

Shane,

No, I've seen it too. For those PHP packages that I really wanted to work
that uses $php_self, someone else figured out what the package wanted for
this variable, and then I set it manually as a non-system variable in the
packages configuration file, such as:

$php_self = action.php;

How about a list option of digest mode? It works in other places.  I
filter my e-mail in outlook into folders and use a separate e-mail just
for lists rather than use my personal e-mail so when I check my mail
remotely through a web interface I am not flooded with stuff I don't
need to reply to.

My opinion. I hate web based forums.  I was on one for awhile at Winamp
trying to get a streaming audio server online, but sometimes you like to
have more information rather than when you just post.  In the e-mail if
you don't like the 
Thread you just delete the whole thread.

Internet.com isp lists are very active and they are not web based.  The
searchable archives are..

To the list operators: maybe it will be a better alternative to use some

sort of bulletin board (ultiboard is a good one) for postings. (example:

http://www.powerbasic.com/support/forums/Ultimate.cgi). I once created
such 
a bulletin board and it's easy to maintain.

Your mailbox is not flooded with mails you probably won't read, the
threads 
are separated by subject.
When i first used a bulletin board, i didn't like the idea (impossible
to 
attach documents, difficult to quote and edit text, ...) but after a
while 
i began to appreciate the board.
You can get a notification whenever somebody respond to your posting and

you can check the board whenever you want, not when you check your mail.
And you can create different forums for those who only work with 
windows/unix/mac/...

FYI, after doing a lot of research and reading numerous posts from the PHP-DEV
list.

This is not a problem that is specific to Xitami. It occurs when PHP is run as
a CGI process, which is how we use PHP with Xitami.

The solution is, as Warren pointed out, to explicity set $PHP_SELF. If the PHP
scripts are written in a modular fashion this is easy, but if they aren't it
can be a pain.

When you reply to a message in Outlook you can change the response to
plain test by going to the format menu. Also when you open a message it
does tell you whether or not it is in HTML.    Well anyway he said the
same thing to me but I can check sent messages and all of them are test.

	Or a Newsgroup. People can use their NNTP clients (I use XNews
http://xnews.3dnews.net/), and there's even some web interfaces for NNTP
newsgroups available, for those who love a pure web browser solution.

	You can see Threading properly, etc.

	Most good News readers actually warn you if you try to reply including the
entire original message.

	XNews can also color included paragraphs differently, so it's easy to make
sense out of the ">", ">>", ">>>"and so on. All while keeping messages in pure
TXT, no HTML.

	Just an idea...

Considering the ISAPI/SAPI version of PHP is still not considered stable, no.

The alternative is to use PHP as a module with (dare I say it) Apache, but
that defeats the purpose of using our lean, clean and mean Xitami setups.

There is already a digest mode available.  About 10% of the subscribers
to the list use it.

If you want to change to digest mode, then go to the list details page
(the URL in the signature below), and enter your email address/password
in the box at the bottom to change details -- then there's a tickbox for
turning digest mode on/off.

FWIW, I'm not very fond of web-based forums either.  Particularly the

Indeed; and this post of yours was correctly in that format.

Amazed though I am to hear this, I've just looked at my partner's machine
(she uses Outlook 2000 as a mail client, fetching her mail from this OS/2
machine using POP3, and sending her outgoing mail to the SMTP server
hereon), and indeed I cannot find anything that deals with what to do in
that event.

Netscape has an option "always send in plain ASCII, even when the
original is in HTML (or multipart/alternative)".  Whilst astounded by
MICROS~1 non-provision of an option to suppress HTML altogether, I am not
completely surprised.

All the same, it might be worth asking if there might be a setting after
all on the <news:microsoft.public.outlook.configuration> froup.

In the meantime, I'll try to remember to be less scathing of those using
Outlook [Express] (although, of course, one has to question the wisdom of
using a piece of software that has been demonstrated to commit over 200
violations of Internet standards (as enshrined in various RFCs).

Yep: it's fine.

Hmm, I've never used a mailer that has the capability of deleting traffic
on a "thread" that has not yet arrived.  How do you ensure that mail is
threaded anyway, given that the use of In-Reply-To is only sketchily
followed by some MUAs, and that others use References instead, which is
something that actually belongs to Usenet?  (RFC-2822, which is still
only a "proposed standard", mentions References for the first time; it
was not part of THE standard RFC-822.  Moreover, the latter never
mandated the use of I-R-T, and even the new one only places both at the
level of a SHOULD, and not a MUST.)

Perhaps the amount of traffic on this list could justify a proper Usenet
newsgroup.  Perhaps a case could be made for restructuring the
comp.infosystems.www.servers.* hierarchy, which (foolishly, IMHO)
contains the groups:
    comp.infosystems.www.servers.mac
    comp.infosystems.www.servers.misc
    comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows
    comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix

Obviously no one envisaged the concept of a cross-platform server; all
the same comp.infosystems.www.servers.xitami might not be beyond the
realms of possibility.

Would anyone care to try raising an RFD?

(OTOH, Imatix could run an NNTP server on their systems, that handles
only a xitami newsgroup, or hierarchy of them.  I'm generally against the
concept of special-to-one-server-only newsgroups, since I consider that
the advantage of a newsgroup is that one reads it from the most local
server, wherever one happens to be.  But Borland use one, as do Serenity
Systems (for the ecomstation.* hierarchy).)

Errm, Outlook (as opposed to Outlook Express) hasn't got such a selection
available :-(

[It damned well should have, of course.]

This is probably true.  (And I like newsgroups much more than I like web
"message boards", and to some extent more than I like mailing lists.)

If anyone wants to follow this through (start the RFD process for a new
newsgroup), then I'm happy to provide some support (eg, statistics on
number of users of the mailing list, etc).  However I don't have time to
do it myself.

Anyone keen to see about establishing a newsgroup?  (Possibly even an
alt.* newsgroup would do.)

>(OTOH, Imatix could run an NNTP server on their systems, that handles

This is generally the worst-of-all-worlds.  The major advantage of
newsgroups is that they're well distributed.  And if there's just one
newsserver carrying the newsgroup, then everyone has to adjust their
newsservers to read from that one.  It's basically a web "message board"
with different software.

Hello...

http://test.modernwonder.com  & www.modernwonder.com are two different
servers one in in Oregon and the other in in Kansas. The company I
register my domain offers free dns so I donts need to us dnstogo  but I
may try it. The company I have my domain name registered through
operates the DNS server, so any changes I make as in the addition of an
alias or the location of the main web are reflected instantly. In the
case of modernwonder.com I have that set for url forwarding to another
domain. This is for my father in law.  Test is my server for devlopement
purposes. I host everything of mine on a cold fusion server. I really
want ot get into Cold fusion so I rent space out of a server in Kasas> I
host a few sites on there already. I have about 4-6 Gb worth of
transfers per month.  This seemed to be the most ecconomical way to do
it right now.

Again when I changed the portbase it was reflected in the control panel
and I was only able to connect using the port number I specified so I
know the cfg is correct.

Www is not needed on any domain.  Most ISP set up the dns or the
webserver to default to www. This is called a domain alias.

Talked to ATT today.  I am also having troubles sending files via icq
too. They claim to only filter ports: 137, 138, 139, 520 and 1080.
Wonder why... I have tried other port numbers like 6080 and higher ones
as well. Still no effect.

As for my posts that I get back form the list, all say Plain Text at the
top.  I will send the e-mail to you with a screenshot.  I hope that this
will end that discussion.

Thanks

I was not able to connect to http://test.modernwonder.com  but, I was
able to connect to www.modernwonder.com .

Personally, I have never tried to use subdomains in this setup yet,
although I will soon.  But, there are a few points to look at here
regardless.  So . . .

A) if you are using dns2go to port forward for you, notice that it only
forwards web requests with the www prefix.  So the URL
http://test.modernwonder.com will not port forward.  Dns2go will instead
try to send it to your ip on port 80 regardles of what you have it set
to in the client.

B) when someone tries to connect to you from near within the Road Runner
network, dns2go forwards them directly to your IP, so actually they end
up contacting you from within the Road Runner network and may not
encounter a port 80 block on their way.  We are probably far enough
apart that I still encounter a port 80 block on my way to you - so i do
not see your site.

C) when you use vhosting on xitami, you get a separate defaults.cfg file
for each one.  If this one is set to a portbase of 0, it is listening on
port 80 anyway.  If it has a higher portbase, you probably wouldn't be
able to connect to it because dns2go is not forwarding since there is no
www prefix.

Here's what I would try:
1) Change your vhost to www.test.modernwonder.com
2) Check the defaults.cfg in the folder that xitami creates.  Make sure
to set the portbase to 6000 or 8000 or whatever it is that works for
www.modernwonder.com .
3) go ahead and register www.test.modernwonder.com at dns2go in the
multi-domain manager section of the site, and make sure it is "grouped"
with www.modernwonder.com .  I'm not sure if the www is required, but
you should at least register test.modernwonder.com.
4) wait about a day for things to sort themselves out . . .

Hopefully that helps, if not, let me know and I will play around some
here.

P.S. Thanks for the global outlook reply setting, Jeff Hamblin.  And

Trust me this is not a lot of posts for an e-mail discussion group!   I
get over 300+ a day in www.isp-wireless.com along! As for newsgroups it
seems for the most part that us techies are the only ones that use them.
Less ISP's (from what I read on the isp lists) are supporting them due
to the fact that people don't use them much like the free webspace they
get.  The following was a post on the list.

"I run a small ISP here in Oklahoma, we offer it because with our Linux
server once we place them on our server they automatically get a home
page. I have only had 3 people use it out of 400 users..."

So ISP's are either outsourcing because not as many people request them
or use them along with shell accounts, webpage space and newsgroups.
Form the Isp standpoint Newsgroups take a lot of resources. Money,
hundreds of gigs worth of space...

toodles

Yes I have been playing around with the ports.   All changes are
performed instantly. So there might be a bunch of different people
getting a bunch of different port numbers as I mess around with it
today...
 
Thanks

Just an FYI: I tried to hit your site and was redirect to an IP#
12.224.45.151 port 8383

Hello...

http://test.modernwonder.com  <http://test.modernwonder.com /> &
www.modernwonder.com <http://www.modernwonder.com/>  are two different
servers one in in Oregon and the other in in Kansas. The company I
register my domain offers free dns so I donts need to us dnstogo  but I
may try it. The company I have my domain name registered through
operates the DNS server, so any changes I make as in the addition of an
alias or the location of the main web are reflected instantly. In the
case of modernwonder.com I have that set for url forwarding to another
domain. This is for my father in law.  Test is my server for devlopement
purposes. I host everything of mine on a cold fusion server. I really
want ot get into Cold fusion so I rent space out of a server in Kasas> I
host a few sites on there already. I have about 4-6 Gb worth of
transfers per month.  This seemed to be the most ecconomical way to do
it right now.

Again when I changed the portbase it was reflected in the control panel
and I was only able to connect using the port number I specified so I
know the cfg is correct.

Www is not needed on any domain.  Most ISP set up the dns or the
webserver to default to www. This is called a domain alias.

Talked to ATT today.  I am also having troubles sending files via icq
too. They claim to only filter ports: 137, 138, 139, 520 and 1080.
Wonder why... I have tried other port numbers like 6080 and higher ones
as well. Still no effect.

As for my posts that I get back form the list, all say Plain Text at the
top.  I will send the e-mail to you with a screenshot.  I hope that this
will end that discussion.

Thanks

MessageHello Many Lists,

If I type the name in it comes up for
me,
> but it does not for my wife at work. Could you please check it?

I was not able to connect to http://test.modernwonder.com
<http://test.modernwonder.com /> but, I was
able to connect to www.modernwonder.com <http://www.modernwonder.com/>
.

Personally, I have never tried to use subdomains in this setup yet,
although I will soon.  But, there are a few points to look at here
regardless.  So . . .

A) if you are using dns2go to port forward for you, notice that it only
forwards web requests with the www prefix.  So the URL
http://test.modernwonder.com <http://test.modernwonder.com/>  will not
port forward.  Dns2go will instead
try to send it to your ip on port 80 regardles of what you have it set
to in the client.

B) when someone tries to connect to you from near within the Road Runner
network, dns2go forwards them directly to your IP, so actually they end
up contacting you from within the Road Runner network and may not
encounter a port 80 block on their way.  We are probably far enough
apart that I still encounter a port 80 block on my way to you - so i do
not see your site.

C) when you use vhosting on xitami, you get a separate defaults.cfg file
for each one.  If this one is set to a portbase of 0, it is listening on
port 80 anyway.  If it has a higher portbase, you probably wouldn't be
able to connect to it because dns2go is not forwarding since there is no
www prefix.

Here's what I would try:
1) Change your vhost to www.test.modernwonder.com
<http://www.test.modernwonder.com/> 
2) Check the defaults.cfg in the folder that xitami creates.  Make sure
to set the portbase to 6000 or 8000 or whatever it is that works for
www.modernwonder.com <http://www.modernwonder.com/>  .
3) go ahead and register www.test.modernwonder.com
<http://www.test.modernwonder.com/>  at dns2go in the
multi-domain manager section of the site, and make sure it is "grouped"
with www.modernwonder.com <http://www.modernwonder.com/>  .  I'm not
sure if the www is required, but
you should at least register test.modernwonder.com.
4) wait about a day for things to sort themselves out . . .

Hopefully that helps, if not, let me know and I will play around some
here.

Jay Steven Aldrich

P.S. Thanks for the global outlook reply setting, Jeff Hamblin.  And
sorry Many Lists, but it seems you are still sending in html.

	Yes. I actually use the newsgroups by VMware news.vmware.com , by Creative Labs
news.creative.com, the Eclipse one news.eclipse.org and the HTML-Kit one
chamisplace.com.

	No need to adjust newsservers. You just adjust your newsclient to have an extra
profile/account, to use that specific server instead of teh one in your ISP.

	No need to vote or anything. You can just install your own NNTP server with
your own groups. Lots of people operate that way. Including, as I said, Creative
Labs, IBM, VMware, Microsoft, etc.

Hello Many Lists,

I'm sorry, but I thought you said:

> > > I have the exact same setup as you but it wont work for me.

1) You are not using Road Runner - you are using AT&T
2) You are not using dns2go, you are using some other name server
3) You are using a subdomain of a domain that is hosted in another state - I
have a single domain
4) Doesn't sound like your ip is dynamic, although it is not clear at this
point
5) You are using the xitami html interface,  while I am editing the config
files directly

The suggestions I gave in my last post was specific to my setup.  And, yes,
www is required in order to use port forwarding in dns2go.  I know it is not
required in general, but it is what the dns2go sever program specifically
looks for in order to know what to port forward and not port forward.  In
other words dns2go will not port forward http://mydomain.com  , but it will
port forward http://www.mydomain.com .  It all ends up at the same ip, but
only the one with the www prefix gets port forwarded by dns2go (in other
words its specific to dns2go).

I'm sorry but your setup is very different than mine.  From your responses,
it seems that your provider may well be at fault.  My guess is Xitami is
working fine - as it is serving out web pages to those who can get to it.
Hopefully with enough experimentation, you'll find a port that everyone can
get through on.

And, I'm not trying to get on your case, cause I don't even care cause I'm
on high-speed and got drive space for weeks, but your original response to
my post that I received at 3:48 PM was in html - not the one you sent the
screen shot of.

After playing with it some today, I was able to get the same result with
$SCRIPT_NAME.  I've read that it is an Apache variable, but xitami must
use it in a similar fashion.  Anyone else have any luck with this?  See
any problems with it?

I meant I was running the same cfg file.  I did edit directly.  What
made you believe I didn't?  My ip is dynamic but the DHCP server never
gives you an IP address so I suppose it is based off the mac address I
gave them. Then again I never gave them the mac for my laptop which I
connect directly to the net sometimes. At Home/Att/Comcast is just plain
Nuts...

type winipcfg ... then disconnect and reconnect and do it again ... if the
ip remains the same a few days running then you have fixed ip if not its
dynamic.

If they were routing using mac addresses your laptop wouldn't work at all so
its tcp/ip.

That's eactly what I did.  I think they plan to bind thw ip address to
the mac address on the DHCP server. I know you can do it in windows Nt
but am unsure how the do it in unix.  DHCP is neatfor setup of small
business and home networks. However I can't imagine why they just can't
just do away with the DHCP . Anyhow pray and watch to ipv6.

What part of the phrase "trim quoted material to provide JUST ENOUGH
context" do you not understand?

You DO realize that you can highlight gobbets of text in the message
composition window, and then press DEL to get rid of them, don't you?

I meant that it seems to be a good subsitute for $php_self.  I seem to get
the same results that $php_self SHOULD give me.  Sorry for the confusion.

Could you take a look at http://12.224.45.151/  and see if the server is
working properly? I am on a cable modem too from ATT. Wife says at the
hospital that it won't come up. Weird.


In some states, AT&T blocks all incoming connections on all ports (except
I've noticed that SMTP (port 25) gets past the firewall through to only
AT&T's internal network servers, but it doesn't get through to the
destination machine).

Hope this helps.

I'm not quite sure what header feature you are trying to use but what 
you seem to be doing is concatentating 2 complete HTML pages in one 
request. The second page get has the Content-type etc messages at the 
top of it but just before them there is a </body></html> statement which 
is certainly not necessary

The Bat is a good program but it is still just a rip of PMMail.  PMMail is
far superior to The Bat.

Hello,

I hav Xitami running on a Windows 2000 machine.

I can browse my pages, but cannot execute a cgi-bin
program.  I get an internal server error (500).

Xitami is stated like this

	xitami -r \www -c \www

I can run the cgi-bin program from a dos prompt and get ascii
output...

Any help would be appreciated!!

thx in advance,
-Joe

If you are talking about running cgi/perl scripts then yes.

I may have missed something here (or just be plain ignorant) but I can't see
anything in the original post to
indicate that the 'cgi-bin program' is a perl script ???

No, you just have to make sure your CGI-BIN directory is configured correctly
so that Xitami can find it.

What's the URL you are using to access your CGI?

Absolutely not, you just have to ensure that

     1. the webuser has execute privileges in the cgi-bin directory
     2. points to the cgi executable
     3. Your cgi executable is reading it's stdin etc correctly

You may have to resort to pop up messages or text log files produced by your cgi
program to let you know if xitami is actually calling your executable.

I have not seen anything run in the cgi-bin directory that wasn't a cgi or
perl script, of course I haven't seen a lot. I guess you could run about any
exe file there. I haven't played around enough with vb scripts or some of
the other scripts to know if that is what they use but I think they call it
CGI-bin for a reason. So if someone knows what other things you can run in
there let me know, I might like to experiment a bit.

A lot of cgi scripts will run by changing them from .cgi to .pl, and Xitami
seems to run them with less tweaking then MS IIS.

Paul - You must know something that I don't. I had to install perl 5 to get
any of my cgi or perl scripts to run. And I believe it stated so in the
Xitami instructions. So what am I missing?

Anyway we need to ask "what are you trying to do".

cgi-bin is a acronym for "Common GateWay Binary" directory. You can place any
executable in the directory and run it as long as the executable takes it's
input from stdin and environment variables and sends it's output to stdout. That
is you can write your own cgi exe's as long as you adhere to the published CGI
protocol.

Deplhi and C++Builder are good examples of development environments that are
delivered with the necessary components to create CGI binaries, many people use
third party libraries to write vb programs for cgi.

Perl and php are most commonly used because they transparently handle the CGI
protocol for you. However, if perl or php are used then the perl binary (it's
large) or php.exe have to be launched in order to interpret / compile the
script. Sometimes a small stand alone exe can perform far better under load.
It's a matter of trading convenience / performance.

For REALLY GOOD performance an LRWP is the answer with Xitami.

Ron,

I have written many programs in Clipper - a database x-base program. They are
working very nicely. I do believe you can run almost any EXE program as long as
you have a way of getting the input / output you need from it.

Why do you have "cgi-bin/" in there twice?

> I have not seen anything run in the cgi-bin directory that wasn't a cgi or perl script, 

As Mr Shortis says, "CGI" is an interface between a web server
program and any other program. I don't think "a cgi" has much
meaning, except that it is probably -something- that can work
with the CGI protocol. 

>  I guess you could run about any exe file there. 

Yes. On a Windows machine, put Sol.exe in your cgi-bin folder. Go
to a browser on another machine and call
http://othermachine/cgi-bin/sol.exe. Nothing will happen in the
browser, it will time-out waiting for a reply; sol.exe is not
meant to read and write data according to the CGI protocol. But
when you go back to the server you will find Solitaire started
and ready to play. 

Which is a reason to be VERY careful what you put in the CGI
folder. Solitaire is pointless but safe (unless someone opens a
hundred copies of it and chokes the server RAM); but other
programs, especially ones that read and write to standard input
and output, can send back all sorts of information.

The testcgi.exe program that used to come with Xitami-Win is an
example. It shows anybody several bits of information about the
server machine's configuration, like PATH and where the HTTP
files are actually stored. In itself it isn't a lot of exposure,
but in conjunction with other info it could aid a hacker. 

BTW: in DOS/Win a BAT file can be a useful CGI program. It gets
awkward in a hurry (DOS BAT files eat "<" signs and aren't too
smart anyway) but I use a BAT file to call a filter and an
emailer  and a logger in sequence. In unix, shell-scripts can be
very useful CGI programs. (Also very dangerous because of the
power of the unix shell.)

Sorry I've taken so long Joseph, been busy. I see someone has already beaten me
to it - if your email is correct you had two /cgi-bin's in the path

checked it myself

http://localhost/cgi-bin/testcgi.exe

should reward you with a page listing the environment variables passed to
testcgi.exe by Xitami

The cgi is the testcgi.exe in the xitami cgi-bin directory.

Ive tried getting that working to display its output via xitami.
I can execute it and get output, but cannot get it to execute from
the browser.

the file are thus

c:\usr\src\xitami\cgi-bin\testcgi.exe

I now run xitami like this:

xitami -r  \usr\src\xitami\webpages -c \usr\src\xitami\cgi-bin

(Ive tried xitami -r  \usr\src\xitami -c \usr\src\xitami)

Theres nothing in the cgierr.log.

Hi people,

It would be nice to know what the cgi is written in, but assuming its
perl
and it works in dos that would indicate that perl was installed.

I have just downloaded and installed the xitami web server (windows 98).  I 
cant seem to find my cgi-bin!  Its supposed to be at c:\xitami\cgi-bin but 
its not there.  There are other folders such as cgi-src, but no cgi-bin.  In 
addition, in the help files, the 'test cgi' thingie doesnt work..it returns a 
message saying "the address you specified cannot be found"  I have 
uninstalled everything, re-downloaded the program and reinstalled it.  Same 
problem both times. What gives?
  
Can I create my own cgi-bin folder?

The demo CGI files that used to come with Xitami were not real
useful and might compromise security. The CGI files were removed
from the latest release; the package builder saw that the CGI-BIN
folder was empty so didn't include it at all.
  
> Can I create my own cgi-bin folder?

Absolutely.

If you have no handy CGI program to try, put this text in a file and
save it as .\cgi-bin\test.bat :

@echo Hello!

Then open http://localhost/cgi-bin/test.bat and it should say
"Hello!" at you.

Yes, please do.

The testcgi was left out of the base install over concerns that it was a
security risk (it does tell various details about your computer by
default); the cgi-bin directory was accidentally left out because there
was nothing in the directory (and the installer we use generally omits
empty directories).

I know that I cannot; however, I'd be surprised if ANYONE can, since the
way you've posted your question leaves huge ambiguities about what,
exactly, your problem might be.

The main ambiguity, as I see it, is that there are a number of posts
there: some with sensible trimming out of original material, and salient
follow-up questions being asked, and atop of all this, various comments
by "top-posters" who have made no apparent attempt to make it clear just
to which point (if any) they are responding.  Therefore one is left to
guess as to exactly what it was that they were attempting to amplify:
there's lots of untrimmed quote below, and one would need to be a
mind-reader to understand just which bit it was that they had read and to
which they had responded.

Ditto with your post: just which bit (if any) of that farrago was "your
problem"?

What is so difficult in <http://www.geocities.com/nnqweb/nquote.html>
that people persist in TOFU-posting, to the detriment of clarity?

OK I start over...

In the 'Xitami' folder there is an other folder called 'headers' 
and if you put a file called 'header.html' Xitami will place 
that file at the top of every page called '****.html' .

Now my problem is that when I do this, it puts some text 
between the header and the site witch I do not want. Is 
there a way to get rid of it.

Unfortunately, Xitami doesn't allow this as far as I can tell.  You could
try modifying the source.  Also, if you have firewall, you can just put the
HTTP server on a different port and block it at the firewall level and then
forward FTP to the proper port.

Hope this helps!

You can't.  Xitami is a webserver, which happens to have a small FTP add
on.  If you just want FTP you'd be better off using a different FTP
server.

While I like Xitami's FTP module, it is hardly a full-featured
FTP server. And as Thomas said, it isn't meant to be run apart
from the HTTP server. 

There are LOTs of decent stand-alone FTP servers out there. Most
are more complete FTP machines than the Xitami module. 

See http://serverwatch.internet.com/ftpservers.html for a fairly
good listing.

Subject: [Xitami] port 80 in use error
Message-ID: <853CE5E8344DD41198B900508BD6BC90671E7A@DMNTEXCH>

Quick question.  I have had xitami running off and on for about 2 years now.
It's always worked great and I have never really done much with it besides
download, and then put my simple WebPages into the webpage folder.  Couldn't
have been more simple.  Friday I downloaded the latest version, but no the
beta.  After rebooting an error pops up saying port 80 is already in use.
Though I can surf to my pages from an outside machine.  Is it trying to
start xitami twice maybe?  I didn't get a chance to look at it this weekend
and now that I am back to work it's bugging me. 

It's running on a win2k machine. 

thanks

mike

Subject: [Xitami] Building LRWP example with VisualC++
Message-ID: <v01530500b88df65d7271@[193.190.195.125]>

Hi everyone,


I am a new user of Xitami and I am very happy of it, but I have a problem
using LRWP, could anyone help me ??? Any assistance would be greatly
appreciated ! The problem is the following one :

I try to build the simple LRWP example with VisualC++ but the
compiler/linker is never happy, always mentioning more problems and asking
for other files, headers... I am lost now and I can't figure out what
exactly should be in the project and what should not. Help please !!!

By advance, thank you.

Greetings from Belgium,

The best IRC server that I've been able to find on the Win32 platform is
UnrealIRCd.

http://www.unrealircd.com

The newer versions use a config file that's unlike anything else, though, so
if you decide to try it, read up on it first.

Sure, but you don't specify which platform you intend to run it on. We 
are happily running all kind of daemons on OS/2 but something tells me 
you don't mean to run it on OS/2...

Message-ID: <200202130012.BAA09267@sxpublic.nxrda.imatix.net>

Good Day,

My FTP client says the following ...

    Socket connected waiting for login sequence.
    220-220 Xitami FTP 2.5b1 (c) 1991-99 iMatix <http://www.imatix.com>


But it goes no further. I've upgraded from 2.4x, where FTP worked.

NT Service with user account set to 'see' the EXE folder and the data folder to FTP.

I have succeeded in setting up virtual hosts, which works. I'm modifying the defaults.cfg, not a virtual_host.cfg

Any ideas ?



Thanks for any help.

Don't use 2.5b1.  It's broken.

Download 2.5b5 if you want to try the beta version: http://www.xitami.com/

 Good Day,

 Assume I run an uninstall on a service (which was shut down).
 The uninstall does not remove the service from the Control Panel.
 How can I remove this service. The EXE has gone away.
 I'm ending up with two services, one of which I disable (the old one I want to go away)

 Any ideas ?

Subject: [Xitami] SSI won't get data from another page?
Message-ID: <NFBBLAJNNACAPEPIMNLMMEMFCBAA.Fontaine@Purdue.edu>

Hello -
	I am trying to use SSI to get data from a text file that is not local.  I
used the syntax <!--#include
virtual="http://OtherServerHere/~MyUserName/updates.txt" -->

This does not seem to work, however I know the server is parsing the page
because if I use a reference to a file inside my DocRoot Folder, it shows up
correctly.

I have tried changing the perlssi script in the program root to force
$DOCPATH = 'http://OtherServerHere/~MyUserName/'; and using simply
"/updates.txt" in the Include line of the shtml page, but it is almost as
though perlssi is not even used, it still will open local files if a file
exists.  There is no error if it does not exist.  I even set up a filter for
.shtml to use perlssi


How can I make this work?

Also - I do have access to the update.txt file via a H: Drive Mapping, but
can't seem to get it to work with Include File either.
 Any Suggestions?

Thanks!

 Yeah it was I guess.  I got a chance to mess with it last night.  I decided
to completely uninstall xitami.  I reinstalled it and had new problems.  It
wouldn't run.  I would start the server and after a few seconds it would
stop.  I think I had probably "ran" 2 different exe files, as in one for win
2000, and one for win95 or something like that.  Which caused some really
weird things with the server console.

 It runs fine now.  Thanks list.

Have you got the old version running as a service or whatnot?

This is noted in the docs.

Look for the *.CPL file. On NT4 it is in c:/WinNT/system32 . Delete
the extra one. (If not sure, rename it and see if things break.)

That didn't work - How can I specify to pull the text file from another web
server?  It's not stored on this machine.  AFter I modify perlssi to do what
I think needs to be done, do I have to complie it or re-start the server or
anything like that to get it to be read?  I am very sure that it is not
being used right now, even though I have made changes to it.

Hi there:

I am hoping someone on the list can shed some light on a problem I'm having
accessing my server from the Internet.

I have a network running at home (Win98SE, ICS, and Xitami), and am able to
get an HTTP response from Xitami on Port 9080 from within the network but
not from outside , i.e. the Internet. Here's the setup:

- Cable Internet connection. The cable provider has confirmed that it's
blocking Port 80.  Hence my server is running on Port 9080.

- The cable modem is connected to a Compaq 200 (w/164 MB RAM) running Win
98(SE), Microsoft ICS, and Xitami Ver. 2.4d9.

- This Compaq is connected to an 8-port hub which in turn provides Internet
access via ICS to 5 other machines on the home network.  This is also the
machine on which Xitami (Ver. 2.4d9) is installed (http on Port 9080).

All machines including the server can access the Internet and each other.
All machines including the server can successfully access Port 9080 from
within the network using all methods (Cable provided IP address,
192.168.0.1, 127.0.0.1, and computer name).  But I can't get Xitami to
respond from outside the network.  I assumed ZoneAlarm was causing this.  I
uninstalled it, but it didn't make a differnce.

Xitami is installed with the defaults, except that http is on port 9080, and
FTP on port 9121.  No other changes.

Can anyone offer any suggestions, please?

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Regards,

Viraf

Thanks for posting this.  It's one of the few "serious" attempts to get
performance data out of Xitami, and I'm quite pleased with the results
that they've found.

It currently does, yes, to avoid issues with people with multiple email
addresses. 

I haven't, yet, noticed any spam arriving through the list -- but if it
has (or when it does), the list will be changed to "subscriber posts
only".

Thanks.   It has turned up here now.

I've changed the list to be "members posting only".  

Anyone who has been posting from an address other than the one that they
are subscribed from should either (a) use the address they're subscribed
from for posting or, (b) subscribe the other address as well in a
"nomail" mode.  (What this means is that you'll be able to send mail
from both subscribed addresses, but the list will only send out copies
of the messages to one of the addresses.  This can be done from the
webpages.)

Um, perhaps I am misinterpreting the meaning of "spam", but I got an email 
from the xitami list titled "Credit Card Debt Solutions" that was definitely 
spam.  Unless of course credit card debt has something to do with the xtami 
server? ;-) 

Cracked me up acutally because right at the end of the ad it says "we

Oh well, just add it to all the other junk in my email box!

I'm planning on using Xitami to run some Python cgi scripts that are to be =

Xitami at comp.lang.python).  I'd like to make things as secure as =
possible.  Can anyone give me an overview of configuration tips for Xitami =
to help avoid any breaches?  I'll set up a user/password he'll have to =
enter, but other than that, what configuration options would be helpful?

I'm running Windows XP, connected to the Internet via cable modem.

Any pointers appreciated!

Message-ID: <b9.1b99a2d9.299c3cc3@aol.com>

Hi there.  Not sure if this is an xtami problem or a me problem, but perhaps 
someone out there will know how to fix it.

I am trying to run perl cgi scripts.  I can get simple print statements to 
work.  However when i send a script input from a form, it executes the script 
and then returns a blank page.  
I know this is not a problem with my script, because I have cut and pasted 
several different cgi's from other sources, same problem every time.
Any ideas?

It should be changed to subscriber mode only.  Most lists are set this
way  & Yes there was spam on the list.

For people with multiple addresses,  in outlook anyway  (groans in the
background)   When I reply to this post,  it automatically uses the same
e-mail account for which the e-mail was addressed to.

bob@bob.com subscribes to list. When he replies his computer
automatically picks bob@bob.com and not bobswife@bob.com
Which is another account in outlook.

What's the issue?

Thanks

It currently does, yes, to avoid issues with people with multiple email
addresses. 

I haven't, yet, noticed any spam arriving through the list -- but if it
has (or when it does), the list will be changed to "subscriber posts
only".

This is off subject, but I reported the spam to the provider of the IP
address that the "click here" pointed to, and apparently the server has
been closed down just since this morning. 

I am working on a set of pages that show how to report spam to the
managing provider of the place the spam actually originated from. The
pages will also cover how to report to the provider if the spam came
through an open SMTP server or through a mailing list like this one did.
I have had very good results using this method.

The pages are still under development and probably won't be complete for
another couple of weeks, but some of the data is available now if anyone
is interested.

Man, what great press for Xitami.  I talked to the VP of a collocation
company in LA about Xitami (because he was curious as to what web server I
was running on my machine at his facility).  He wanted to learn more - but
now I have some actual statistics to pass on to him.  I am confident he is
going to be switching over to Xitami within the next six months.  His
facility has over 1200 Linux/Unix based servers and they host over 32,000
domains.

The best feeling is that I have been using Xitami for over 3 years now.
Even then, it was simply to robust and to simple to use to pass on.

Keep up the awesome work.

So apparently running xitami in turbo mode will damage your hardware.

Message-ID: <mVRXm+AhBva8EwNy@alan-lam.co.uk>

Hi,

I'm very new to this so here goes.

I'm running Win98SE with Xitami v2.4d9
I've managed to run aliases
http://localhost/alan-lam
correctly loads c:\my documents\alan\html\alan-lam

I've installed Perl and that all gets interpreted correctly.

I've installed php 4 into f:\internet\php using the windows installer.

The filter in xitami .php points to f:\internet\php

But when I load a test page in c:\my documents\alan\html\alan-
lam\phptest.html

<html><head><title>PHP Test</title></head> 
<body> 
<?php echo "Hello World<P>"; ?> 
</body></html> 

I just get a blank page without the php being interpreted.

Where do I go from here.

If you call your document ".html" and tell Xitami only to pass ".php"
documents to PHP, then your document won't be passed to PHP :-)

Try renaming it to have a ".php" extension.

The ".php" filter only applies to files with a ".php" extension, but
your test file is called ".html".

The server returns the un-processed file. Because your example has
no visible elements, it looks blank.

Change that file's name to phptest.php and see what you get.

No, that's not what the article says.  The only way your hardware will be
damaged is if it runs in an uncirculated environment and the CPU overheats
or has electrical problems.  In either of those cases you have a more
fundamental problem than just Xitami.

There is nothing wrong with running Xitami in turbo mode.  However, as a
result of running it in turbo mode, it *will* skew benchmarking statistics
as it gets higher thread priority than both IIS and Apache.

Start a Command Prompt (Start->Run, type 'cmd', press enter).
Go to the Xitami directory:

C:\>_
C:\>cd progra~1\xitami

C:\PROGRA~1\Xitami>_

Now, launch Xitami and tell it to remove itself as a service:

C:\PROGRA~1\Xitami>xiwinnt -uninstall

Xitami is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

xiwinnt: stopping service 'Xitami'... Ok

That's it!

User Name and Passwords will be send unencrypted, unless you are willing to buy a SSL certificate.
Xitami on it's own should be secure with the previous exception.
But ... Win9x is not secure. Therefore, I would suggest Linux or NT.
NT out of the box is wide open. Permissions must be set on NT to secure it.
Firewall : Try www.TinySoftware.Com. Works great.

If Xitami is the only service on this box, I don't see a problem. 
If other services, mySQL or a mail server are on the same box, then
Turbo mode will 'crowd out' the other services.

Please adjust your mailer's settings so that it sends ONLY in pure ASCII
(except to those with whom you have previously arranged to exchange HTML
mails).  Mail written in HTML should be for consenting adults only.

Which is very astute of Outlook; finally something I can commend.

However, I'd like to see it do that trick when I post mail from my
account at work, on an entirely different computer in an entirely
different domain.  (With the only commonality being the .uk on the ends
of both addresses.)

One of the biggest problems these days are computers running open SOCKS
proxies (often on ADSL or cable modems).  The owners of these machines
install such a proxy service to facilitate sharing a connection between
multiple computers in a home/SoHo, and take no steps to secure it against
being exploited by outsiders.

The latter come along and send their UCE ["spam" is the wrong
nomenclature] via the ISP's smart host, which is not an open SMTP relay,
but doesn effectively act as one, because it's been duped into believing
that the traffic has originated from an authorized user.

AIUI, the worst example of this for the Windoze world is something called
AnalogX, which comes with the SOCKS proxies completely open by default.
The manual does say how to close it down and make it secure, but...
how many people ever bother to RTFM, hey?

> I have had very good results using this method.

UCE/UBE is always worth fighting (if you just sweep it under the carpet
by filtering it, nothing will ever be done by ISPs to eradicate it at
source), but with the existence of things like AnalogX it becomes VERY
much harder to identify the real source.

I read the article Andreaz and as a systems programmer for many years I have
written many task schedulers.

It is a common misnomer that bad processes use more CPU time and that they can
damage a system. Let me set this straight...
this is total rubbish ! Any process that performs a lot of work is capable of
using 100% cpu time (even a simple calculation loop). The
real measure of an operating is how fairly is shares time amongst two CPU
intensive tasks (windows is not very good (read terrible)
in this regard.

In any case the only time the CPU time used by Xiami in turbo mode would be a
problem would be if you were using the same PC to
perform other tasks other than serving web pages. If it is a dedicated web
server run it in turbo mode and get the best performance
BECAUSE it will use as much available CPU time as it can.

Use a webmail interface to access your e-mail remotely. If your ISP
doesn't have it tell them to get it.  If they don't then use
mail.yahoo.com to check your other pop accounts through yahoo. The
downside is in order for you to check your pop e-mail through yahoo you
have to actually agree to get some spam from them on your yahoo account.
Personally I let all the list e-mail wait till I get back to the office.
I just check my personal e-mail remotely.

I have to say that I agree.  The wasted download and read time for someone
slamming someone else for unintentionally offending anyone by sending a file
in HTML or both text and HTML bothers me far more than the original act.
Either way, its just text.  And, its a losing battle. There will always be
new members on the list who will post this way.

In that case server-side-includes will not do what you want; it can
handle only files that are actually on your machine.

You'll need something to download the file from the remote machine
(fairly easy in Perl, Python, etc), and then either do that regularly
(eg, with a time-triggered program) or on demand (by using PHP or Perl
or something like that to process your pages).

You're welcome to try to change PerlSSI to do something like this,
but note that the Xitami 2.5 beta includes SSI support internally.

You can't call a page from an other server using ssi but yo can use an
iframe or java script.

if you want to use these contact me and I'll walk you through it and show
you how.

Subject: [Xitami] Multiple cgi directories--confusion
Message-ID: <sc6b6f28.031@tlfa.com>

I'm confused by the two config items

[Server]
cgi-bin=path (docs say "Specifies the directory where CGI programs are located")

and

[CGI-Alias]
demos=G:\site\demos (docs say "This section lets you define multiple CGI program roots")

How do these two directives interact?  They seem to sort of overlap.

I would like to set up multiple cgi directories.  I have done this using the CGI-Alias setting, like so:

[CGI-Alias]
abc=c:\web\abc\cgi-bin                 
xyz=c:\web\xyz\cgi-bin      

Now, this seems to work when I point my browser to http://localhost/abc/script.py and http://localhost/xyz/script.py, except that relative paths in the generated html are not resolved correctly: references to images at "../images/x.jpg" fail to find the file, and a style sheet link of "../file.css" fails to find the style sheet.  If I move the style sheet into the cgi-bin directory with the scripts and change the link to "file.css" in the html, it works fine.   Where is the server looking for the files that it can't find?  How can I get these relative paths to work?

Many thanks!

Chris

Subject: [Xitami] Turbo setting
Message-ID: <3C6BD86E.4D6603BB@shawcable.com>

Hello;
    I have installed Xitami v25b5 Beta on a test server running NT 4.0.
I set it up to run in Turbo mode. After reading the posts about Turbo
mode, I decided to check out these settings. 

In Xitami/admin I went into Configuration/advanced Server Properties/ I
changed the Turbo setting to Normal and saved the setting and restarted
Xitami. However, when I rechecked it, I discovered that Xitami had
switched back to Turbo mode. 

No matter what I do, Xitami will not stay in Normal mode, but reverts
back to Turbo mode. Is this a bug in Xitami? or is the Administrator
screwing up (good possibility)? Any suggestions will be appreciated.
            Thanks in advance. Selmer Ausland

PS: I have been running Xitami on two other NT 4.0 webservers for over
two years and no problems whatsoever. Xitami is great!!!

Thanks for your suggestion

I renamed the document to phptest.php

It came up blank. (using IE5.5)

The source which was



<html><head><title>PHP Test</title></head> 
<body> 
<?php echo "Hello World<P>"; ?> 
</body></html> 



when viewed had become



<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<META http-equiv=Content-Type content="text/html; charset=windows-
1252"></HEAD>
<BODY></BODY></HTML>




Any ideas on what to do next.

Thanks

Subject: [Xitami] FTP problems
Message-ID: <NCBBLHNNKNPMOBPMIBDHIELEOMAA.robert.muench@robertmuench.de>

Hi, I'm having some problems with the FTP service of Xitami. The setup I use is
mostly the standard one. I added two virtual hosts, that use the same settings
for FTP as the default server. If I try to login with CuteFTP I get the
following:

STATUS:>  	Login successful.
COMMAND:>	PWD
		257 "/" is the current directory
STATUS:>  	Home directory: /
COMMAND:>	FEAT
		500 'FEAT' is not a valid command
STATUS:>  	This site doesn't support the 'features' command.
COMMAND:>	REST 100
		350 Restarting from 100
STATUS:>  	This site can resume broken downloads.
COMMAND:>	TYPE A
		200 Command okay
COMMAND:>	REST 0
		350 Restarting from 0
COMMAND:>	PASV
ERROR:>   	Control connection closed.
ERROR:>   	Failed to establish data socket.

Further I can connect through a browser with ftp://... Any idea what's the
problem?

    .phtml = "C:\\php\\php.exe"

A proxy server can do this; Xitami doesn't currently have this
functionality (although you could add something like it with a CGI,
PHP/Perl, or a LRWP program.

When I set the filter to 
.php=f:\\internet\\php\\php.exe
or to
.php="f:\\internet\\php\\php.exe"

The page c:\my documents\alan\html\alan-lam\phptest.php
comes up with a 500 error.

When I set the filter back to
.php=f:\internet\php\php.exe
it comes back with a blank page.

What do I do next. I'm so looking forward to testing out some php code
on my own PC rather than having to upload it to my web site over an
expensive dialup line to test it!

Hello all,

In my website I have a link to a page:
http://hace.dyndns.org/games.php

When I click on it, in the browser it is shown as:
http://hace.dyndns.org/games%2Ephp

What should I do to make sure it is showed as:
http://hace.dyndns.org/games.php

in the browser? I thought I had to change something in the templates,
or not??

I don't think that anyone has ever claimed that the FTP server daemon in
Xitami is a fully=fledged piece of software: merely a convenience for
those who perhaps otherwise might never bother to install any form of
ftpd.

I have to agree.  Ok, so you don't "like" headers and HTML.  Neither do most
of us, but that is NO excuse for going off half cocked.  Cool down or get
off the list.   There are more Windows (notice the PROPER spelling) users on

check your error.log file, cgierr.log also your phperror.log

if you eneabled it and gave it a name in the php.ini file

in your AUTOEXEC.BAT add this

SET PATH=f:\internet;%PATH%

NOTE the use of My documents has been known to give Xitami fits it don't
like spaces :)

hope this helps

Dude, (not that it will take a layer of skin off if you leave the list) but
don't let some drivel from a pin-headed, pencil neck geek be the reason to
leave an otherwise informative list. I have learned a lot from this list.

A proxy server can do this; Xitami doesn't currently have this
functionality (although you could add something like it with a CGI,
PHP/Perl, or a LRWP program.

There is _supposed_ to be a civil tone on the Xitami mailing list. 

I'm not at all impressed with the tone that Brian {Hamilton Kelly}
adopted in that message, and have already told him so off list.  (I'm
also not all that impressed with the various bounces I've got from
various mailing systems for "objectionable content"... :-) )

While we'd obviously prefer that posts were in plain text, with a minimum
of quoting and other extraneous material, we'll tolerate posts that
don't quite meet those criteria providing it doesn't get too out of
hand.  And if there's any "getting too far out of hand" then those of us
running the list will be the ones to make the call.

Dan, I hope you'll reconsider your unsubscription.

No.  Because Xitami is not a proxy server (it doesn't have the necessary
functionality).  I've used both Apache and Squid (web caching software)
as proxy servers in the past; there may be others.

No. If you need a proxy install squid. A linux box can quite successfuly 
be both a Xitami web server and a Squid proxy server. It can even (if 
you so desire) transparently proxy and run Xitami at the same time.

Although they get rather stroppy with people modifying the config 
because its really a firewall, smoothwall (www.smoothwall.org) is 
everything you need except the Xitami webserver.

To take out spaces
I've set up alias
temp=c:\temp


In autoexec.bat I've added
set path=f:\internet\php;%path%

I didn't know about the phperror.log. I downloaded the 'big' version of
php to have a look at the php.ini file. (I initially had the windows
installer version). I found out I can set display error!


The php.ini in the windows directory is now

; php.ini for PEAR tests
include_path=..

[mail function]
SMTP= localhost ; for Win32 only
sendmail_from= me@localhost.com ; for Win32 only

[Session]
session.save_path= F:\Internet\PHP\sessiondata    ; argument passed to
save_handler

[PHP]
error_reporting= E_ALL; display all errors, warnings and notices
display_errors = On
display_startup_errors = On
log_errors = On



With a test page
http://localhost/temp/Test Page.html
=>
http://localhost/temp/Test%20Page.html
and pops up fine.

With the php page

<html><head><title>PHP Test</title></head> 
<body> 
<?php echo "Hello World<P>"; ?> 
</body></html> 


http://localhost/temp/phptest.php

I see now see (with the help of display_error = on) :-)

Fatal error: Unable to open F:/Internet/Xitami/webpages/temp/phptest2.ph
p in Unknown on line 0


So ... where and what do I set to get php & xitami talking to each other
about the right directory?

Thanks

create a file in one of your published web directories with an extension
of .php (I usually call it info.php) then place the following in it.

<?php
     phpinfo();
?>

Make sure you have set php.exe up as the filter to process files files with a
.php extension. Then point a browser at the url of the published file & you
should be rewarded with about 4 pages of html describing your php
configuration.

Good luck, Paul

Leave the filter at the setting that gives a blank page (single spashes) then
add the path to
php.exe/php4ts.dll to you PATH variable, the blank page usually means that
Xitami was able to
launch php.exe but for some reason php.exe was unable to load it's dll.

Intel Cache Appliance racks on ebay go for about $300.00 nowadays.

Is a cache appliance the same thing as a proxy server???

Do they all have the capability of serving ASP (or other dynamic pages) that
are sitting behind them?

Q:Intel Cache Appliance racks on ebay go for about $300.00 nowadays.

Response: I didn't know that Intel made internet Caches. Could you send
me a link offline? Thanks

Q: "Is a cache appliance the same thing as a proxy server???"

A: As the name would suggest they are both different functions which are
often combined into the same device.
Internet Cache, Cache Appliance, Squid basically refer to a box which
sits at a connection before the internet.   If the WebPages are used
often the computer stores it on the hard drive, next time someone makes
a request to the internet it will check the box to see if a cached
version is there.   If it is, it saves time for the user and bandwidth
for the business & Isp. Which contrary to belief is not free. 

 A Proxy Server is essentially a gateway in which can perform specified
network functions. Most of the time when people refer to a proxy they
either want to a)use NAT Network Address Translation b)Restrict what
websites you can access or c)restrict or control bandwidth. (How much a
particular IP can download etc.)

http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/c/cache.html

http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/p/proxy_server.html

If you are a whiz at linux you could make a little box do your e-mail,
web server, nat and caching  very inexpensively.

Q:"Do they all have the capability of serving ASP (or other dynamic
pages) that are sitting behind them?"

A:  If you wish to know how a device would "serve" ASP pages then it
would also depend on the "web server" software that you choose.

Do they all have the capability of serving ASP (or other dynamic pages)
that are sitting behind them?

That would depend on the list server software being used and the policy
set forth by the TOS.
Many list software packages give you the option to do this, but most
don't take advantage of it. With my lists you can ban user, domain, IP
etc. (From my experience)  If there is an abuse then the user is kicked
by the list dad after someone taddles. Not usually before a warning. :-)
What would happen if I posted "Shittaki Mushroom" ? Auto kick and ban?
Bahh Usually it's not a problem. If it is adjust you own e-mail
settings. I.e. delete all posts from manylists@attbi.com  oh wait that's
me! Anyhow most of us are adults here. :-)

Go to ebay and make a search for: INTEL NETSTRUCTURE 1520 RACKMOUNT 1U
SERVER.  There is one of these server cache appliances there right now.

I like the idea of a proxy server or a cache server translating the dynamic
ASP content from Microsoft IIS.  Hey, sometimes you cant get around using
the Microsoft products!!!

Xitami is rock solid and no one has ever hacked into one of my Xitami
installations.  As for IIS.....I have trouble keeping it running for more
than a month.  If your business is using Microsoft databases then the
ASP+IIS is a very convinient application server.  The problem is keeping it
running and secure.

That is why I am asking.

I have always known proxy servers to be the definition you give below.  I
knew them to manage user access out to the Internet, but not Internet
browser access to your web pages.

I found it curious that you used a cache server and a proxy server
interchangably as if they were the same thing.

I take it a cache appliance can serve dynamic pages, since by definition
dynamic content cant be stored and re-served without a new query taking
place.

Q:Intel Cache Appliance racks on ebay go for about $300.00 nowadays.

Response: I didn't know that Intel made internet Caches. Could you send
me a link offline? Thanks

Q: "Is a cache appliance the same thing as a proxy server???"

A: As the name would suggest they are both different functions which are
often combined into the same device.
Internet Cache, Cache Appliance, Squid basically refer to a box which
sits at a connection before the internet.   If the WebPages are used
often the computer stores it on the hard drive, next time someone makes
a request to the internet it will check the box to see if a cached
version is there.   If it is, it saves time for the user and bandwidth
for the business & Isp. Which contrary to belief is not free.

 A Proxy Server is essentially a gateway in which can perform specified
network functions. Most of the time when people refer to a proxy they
either want to a)use NAT Network Address Translation b)Restrict what
websites you can access or c)restrict or control bandwidth. (How much a
particular IP can download etc.)

http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/c/cache.html

http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/p/proxy_server.html

If you are a whiz at linux you could make a little box do your e-mail,
web server, nat and caching  very inexpensively.

Q:"Do they all have the capability of serving ASP (or other dynamic
pages) that are sitting behind them?"

A:  If you wish to know how a device would "serve" ASP pages then it
would also depend on the "web server" software that you choose.

Well, its really not the language that bothers me, its the attitude.  Its
just friggin text - whether its HTML or plain text.  I admit some take it
too far by adding backgrounds and graphics, but it is generally not the case
here.  I really don't understand the big deal about it.  A deleted HTML
message takes up no more space than a deleted Plain Text message.

And the whole Linux Supremacy bit is very irritating as well.  I would
prefer a religious freak any day.  At least religious fanatics think the

world are just lowly idiots that are nothing more than herded cattle being

Xitami is a web server that works on both Linux and Windows OSes, so like it
or not, there are gonna be quite a few Windows users on this list.  And even
though it isn't necessarily a good thing, Windows is still the most
popular/common OS on the planet.  And most of these Windows users who are
starting a Xitami-based web server for the first time, and are requesting
assistance, have not yet encountered the likes of a Linux thumper.  They
probably didn't even know that Outlook defaults to HTML messages.  And, they
surely had no idea that it was gonna piss someone off to no end if they did
unknowingly post in HTML.  Face it, HTML is gonna keep coming . . . .

If those guys really have that much of a problem with it, then they should
go start their own list and call it
PlainTextXitamiLinuxFanaticism@yahoogroups.com .  Its free, and it can be
setup to work just like this.  We'll stay here and direct the newcomer Plain

  There was talk of using Zope as an Application Server, which is called via a small CGI.

  Is there anyone who can example this CGI script ?  ( I'm a seasoned programmer)
  What should I be aware of with integrating Zope, mySQL and Xitami ; any pitfalls or shortuts would be helpful.
  
  After reading the docs and installing Zope, I am excited about using it with Xitami.

Yes, that would be my intent.  But from what I am understanding, the cache
server is not the animal for the job.  Sounds like a proxy server from the
post responses.

I never knew a proxy server to perform this function, but if it does it is
worth looking into.

The database manager at work is asking for ASP pages.  However, everyone is
concearned about the amount of resources we would have to put into securing
an IIS server.

risks?

About this whole Linux superiority complex:

1.) The internet is a visual medium, like it or not.  Most of these over
zealous Linux fans brush the reality of this off by saying that you can
create web pages with a simple text editor.  However true that may be, that
assumes that your web graphics are already made, and only need to be called
up.

Until you can run the full suite of Adobe products on Linux, then Linux is
useless as a web graphics platform.  No text editor replaces Adobe Photoshop
or Illustrator.  And if your answer to web graphics is colored text and font
manipulation........well, you just don't get what the Internet is doing.

The ideal environment for graphics is an Apple (considering that Silicon
Graphics machines are out of the reach of everyone who is not Lucasfilm and
Pixar).  Considering that Apple does not even have a server, much less a
database server or web server, they are quickly becoming uncomfortably
unconnected to the new breed of web designers.

This leaves Windows (Winblows to you Linux zealots) as a very attractive
option.  You don't need to know three operating systems, and you can even
stretch your machine to host both a Xitami server and have that same machine
create the graphics, create the web page, manage the web page.....and even
host a database.  Crazy, but if budget is an issue, you cant beat having a
minimum of software titles and a minimum of operating systems to learn and
deploy.

2.) I wont even get into the sound editing issue, since Linux does not even
exist in that field.  However, I will point out that sound IS PART OF the
multimedia realm.

3.) I guess you could pay a graphic designer $90.00 per hour if you want
your web pages to have more than just colored text and pasty
backgrounds........but, hey, that would defeat the whole "self-sufficiency"
of the Linux religion.

4.) Reading nasty messages is definitely much more distracting than simply
erasing a post that was sent using HTML mail.

So lay off the newbies....or simply go create the user group that someone
suggested below.  In order to keep the email list name shorter I suggest you
simply call it LINUX.  Everyone understands this term to be the synonym for
ONE DIMENSIONAL anyways.

P.S. --- Hey look ma!! I wrote this without using HTML!!!

Hello All,
I am having a problem with getting xitami to customize my error pages.  I
got it to work on one of my domains but I can't get it to work on the other
domain.  I have tried everything I can think of.  I copy and pasted the code
into [Server] Section of the .cfg file of the virtual domain.  If I use the
same code as the first domain and paste it into the server code for the
second domain I can get xitami to serve up the error page.  But when I
change the directory of the error pages so that I can have different pages
for the second domain it won't serve the pages up.  Any ideas?
Thank you
Josh

Oops, that should be phptest.php for the above example. I had two test

Message-ID: <20020219101409.38593.qmail@web9601.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello all,

To get rid of all the log-entries created by
http-viruses, I have created a little windows-program
that processes logfiles and removes those 'dirty'
log-entries that clogup the xitami-logfile.

You can view all removed lines and kept lines in the
program because all lines are copied in the listboxes.

You can download the program 'logfilter' at:
http://hace.dyndns.org/files/files.html

Please first read the logfilter.TXT file for further
comments.

If you have questions or suggestions for the program
please sent those to my email address.

Hope this helps people who where searching for this
kind of software and couldn't find it (like myself
;-),

Thanks,
Hace

I am trying to install servlets on xitami and i wrote down every step,
but at this moment a lot of things are unclear to me, and it's not working.
I am testing it on my Windows 2000 laptop, nut want to install it also on a
windows95 pc.

I need some help now, so who wants to help me with making a step-to-step
manual installing servlets ?

_FROM_ a specific address, or TO ?

By default, a web server will serve any request that comes to it. If
you have many DNS names all pointed to the same physical
machine/server (same IP or a milti-IP machine), and leave Vhost
alone, all requests to any name of the machine will get the
specified folder.

If you want requests to certain names to get different folders, then
you use Vhosts.

If you want a request FROM "joe.q.public.com to see
"/wwwfiles/public", but a request from "adrian.insider.com" to see
"/wwwfiles/insiders"....  Xitami won't do that, make decisions based
on the viewer's hostname. You could do something with PHP, or a
fancy firewall.

Hi, I have a strang thing happening with Xitami. To test a new web-site we have
done, I uploaded this site to a subdirectory under a different domain. Than I
accessed the new site by:

www.domain.com/subdir/index.html

And now there is a root-document that performs a check for frames and loads the
given URL inside a frame. Why this? Where does this document come from?

IMO Xitami must be issuing it automatically?

I'm having trouble accessing an internal IP address (192.168.0.50) on my
network.  I can get to my server (24.190.xxx.xxx:9080) properly.  I have a
link on my web page pointing to 192.168.0.50 (a separate machine) which I'm
unable to get to.  It works from WITHIN the network, but not if I try this
from outside.

I use ICS for NAT and have opened up a port on it and have directed it to
192.168.0.50, but it hasn't helped.

I'm not sure of there is something within Xitami which hasn't been correctly
set, or if it is something within ICS.

Please help.

Thanks.

It's not Xitami issuing it automatically; Xitami doesn't know anything
about frames, and the only HTML that it includes/generates automatically
is _very_ basic for directory lists and error messages.

I'd say it's going to be something in the website files that you put in.

Internal IP numbers SHOULDN'T work from "the outside".

Does the other machine have an external IP number or name? If not
(and typically small networks won't), then nobody outside will ever
see it.

I dont't think you will be able to "get to" 192.168.0.50 
from the internet as this is a private non-routable ip 
address. I also don't think this is a Xitami problem. My 
guess is that you would have to define a directory alias 
for your external path or just use another port from your 
24.190.xxx.xxx address forwarded to the 192.168.0.50 
machine. For example use 24.190.xx.xxx:9090 forwarded to 
192.168.0.50. HTH

two questions:

1. where are the list archives? no doubt my questions have been asked
before.

2. i'm running the latest stable version on w2k- ever since i installed it a
week ago my console log is filled with this:

2002/02/18 14:35:30: gslgen E: Can't open schema file schemas/errors.sch

2002/02/18 14:35:31: gslgen E: Can't open schema file schemas/errors.sch

there is no schemas directory in the installation, and i have checked my
config files for references to it and found none.

any ideas?

thanks,

Hello All,

What is the use of ftplogin.txt if that text is never displayed and
always the text from ftpmesg.gsl is displayed?

Is there a way to enter a line in ftpmesg.gsl that makes it so that
the text from ftplogin.txt is sent to the ftp-client upon connecting?

Thanks,

(Address in list signature)

And then click on the link "List Archives".

Those are the archives since it moved to Mailman (middle of last year).

(a) you're _not_ running the stable version, you're running the beta
version, and (b) you're not running the latest beta version either.

Please download the latest version from:

http://www.xitami.com/

And try again.

I have seen those before from the Nimda.

I have a Linksys router and these are showing up in that log.

Any ideas what they are trying to do? I have noticed them on and off for
several weeks now. All trying to hit port 8888

All these today are from .jp but usually it is from various countries all at
the same time.

  As a newbie, I've noticed these lines in the log files.  Is this anything
to worry about?

  Eg:

  GET /default.ida?NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN.....
  GET /_vti_bin/..%255c../..%255c../..%255c../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?.....
  GET /scripts/..%c1%1c../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/.....
  GET /c/winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c

  etc.


  Thanks,

  Hello all,

  To get rid of all the log-entries created by
  http-viruses, I have created a little windows-program
  that processes logfiles and removes those 'dirty'
  log-entries that clogup the xitami-logfile.

  You can view all removed lines and kept lines in the
  program because all lines are copied in the listboxes.

  You can download the program 'logfilter' at:
  http://hace.dyndns.org/files/files.html

  Please first read the logfilter.TXT file for further
  comments.

  If you have questions or suggestions for the program
  please sent those to my email address.

  Hope this helps people who where searching for this
  kind of software and couldn't find it (like myself
  ;-),

  Thanks,
  Hace

Hi, that's really strange. None of the files has some tags for FRAMESET or
something like this... I really have no idea why this happens. The strange
things is further, after I moved the files to a test domain where you access the
site without using a direcotry ULR, it works ??? Robert

CodeRed and Nimda have been flogging the internet for months.

The very-very long request causes an overflow in some web servers.
The intended target is unpatched MS IIS. On that server, the
overflow writes on program space. The little bit of goblygook at the
end is CPU code that "is" the virus.

They also make some other servers unhappy, but because they don't
have the same program code in the same spot they don't get infected.
Just maybe crash.

Xitami is quite immune to the CodeRed exploit. Its writers assumed
that requests might have garbage in them and don't let requests
overflow into program space.

>All trying to hit port 8888

Very odd, it is usually port 80. Maybe a new variant hoping to hit
all you guys behind ISPs that block 80.

user to the internal server hosted on 192.168.0.50.  The main web page is
hosted on a server which has the external 24.190.xxx.xx address.

These are seperate from the ones that are indicated by Nidma from the
previous email.

These logs are from something different. (At least I think so)

There is nothing in the website logs at the present time.

But the others keep pouring in. I have a 2.5 mb log right now for today's
entries.

Ok thanks by the way.  I believe I want req's to certian names to get
different folders.  can  you give me an example of what scheme one would use
for doing this.  the faq ( i think) covered this but I am just too thick
headed at the moments to get what it was saying.  So, if I have two names
set up at say dyndns.  one named frusterated.dyndns.com, and
need-school.dyndns.com can I set up xitami to use a different vhost for each
site?  you may have already answered this but I am not sure.  Consequently,
thanks a million, and sorry for the continued ignorance.

The way I have set it currently is such that a port on the external IP
address 24.190.xxx.xxx (port 10080) maps to the internal server on IP
192.168.0.50:10080.  The internal 'server' is actually a network camera with
a built in Linux server, capable of DHCP.  Perhaps the following will help.

Here's the setup:

** EXTERNAL
Xitami, Win98SE, ICS -  (IP address 24.190.xxx.xxx)
HTTP port - 9080
Port 10080 mapped to the 'internal' (below)

The above responds well from the Internet.


** INTERNAL
Network Camera, Linux Server - (IP address 192.168.0.50)
HTTP port - 10080

When I try to get to http://24.190.xxx.xxx:10080, I expect that I will be
taken to the internal network camera.  It doesn't take me there. I get an
error.

The 192.168.0.50 address is not routable to an outside address. You would
need to do an internal routing through an external port to get there. For
instance port 9080.

Yes.

Open myserver.org/admin, click Vhost Wizard.

Click NEW in top left.

"Create virtual host profile:" [frusterated ].cfg

" enter DNS host name:" [frusterated.dyndns.com ]

"Web page root directory:" [ /frusterated  ]

"Create directories if necessary?" [X]

Click CREATE at bottom.

Do again for "need-school.dyndns.com".

Wait a few minutes. Or restart Xitami. Or restart Windows. Sometimes
Xitami seems reluctant to pick up new Vhosts, so don't panic too
fast.

I assume you already have frusterated.dyndns.com registered at a DNS
server such as dyndns.com . Won't work until that happens.

BTW: "frusterated" is not spelled the way I find in a dictionary.
They like "frustrated". Does not matter in URLs, and I know you are
just throwing out an example.

Subject: [Xitami] Multiple cgi directories--confusion still
In-Reply-To: <sc6b6f28.031@tlfa.com>
Message-ID: <000001c1b9a7$5564a220$d09fef0c@megabytegifqj7>

I'm confused by the two config items

[Server]
cgi-bin=path (docs say "Specifies the directory where CGI programs are
located")

and

[CGI-Alias]
demos=G:\site\demos (docs say "This section lets you define multiple CGI
program roots")

How do these two directives interact?  They seem to sort of overlap.

I would like to set up multiple cgi directories.  Is this possible?  I
have tried this using the CGI-Alias setting, like so:

[CGI-Alias]
abc=c:\web\abc\cgi-bin                 
xyz=c:\web\xyz\cgi-bin      

Now, this seems to work when I point my browser to
http://localhost/abc/script.py and http://localhost/xyz/script.py,
except that relative paths in the generated html are not resolved
correctly: references to images at "../images/x.jpg" fail to find the
file, and a style sheet link of "../file.css" fails to find the style
sheet.  If I move the style sheet into the cgi-bin directory with the
scripts and change the link to "file.css" in the html, it works fine.
Where is the server looking for the files that it can't find?  How can I
get these relative paths to work?

Many thanks!

Chris

Hah!
Hey thanks a million man.  I think that the problem I had before was that
xitami did not pick up the virtual host quickly and I panicked.  I tried the
to set up the vhost and before and thought it didn't work.  guess I should
check the setting again and see if it works.  I do think that I got the hand
of it now.  Sort of a small learning curve on this thing.  thanks.

Adrian.

No you don't have to worry about those lines in your
log-files. That is, they can't harm you but to glog-up
your diskspace or make it more difficult for
analog-analyzers like analog (www.analog.cx).

I just wanted to have my log-files cleared from all
the rubbish so created the logfilter.

Good luck,

Yes.

There's the skeleton of code to start it as another process in SFL (the
library that Xitami uses), but it hasn't been enabled for Xitami.

That should be "user" or "account".  :-)  (I hit "send" before I'd
noticed the typo!)

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami bug with relative redirects
Message-ID: <3C73883A.1050406@freesbee.fr>

Using the standard CGI.pm you can (theoretically) redirect people to a 
URl doing something like
print $query->redirect("destination.url"). This prints two lines to STDOUT

Status: 302 Moved
location: destination.url

And normally you get a redirect from there.

It works is my destination.url is a fully defined 
http://host/path/file.html or similar

But I have found 2 bugs in this with Xitami when one uses a non absolute URL

with a file only relative url (just file.html) it chops of the leading 
character to produce a redirect to ile.html in the ROOT of the webserver 
. i.e. the absolute URL is http://host/ile.html
with a path and file relative url (/path/file.html) the redirect never 
completes and xitami just sits there serving up nothing until you hit 
cancel - conceivably there is a timeout after 120 seconds or whatever 
but I didn't wait that long.

This does not appear to occur with Apache which handles both relative 
URLs just fine. Arguably this is a bug with the redirect generator as  
RFC 2616 (http 1.1) section 14.30 states that only absolute URIs are 
allowed for the location field, but it would be nice to see it 
documented if not fixed.

14.30 Location

   The Location response-header field is used to redirect the recipient
   to a location other than the Request-URI for completion of the
   request or identification of a new resource. For 201 (Created)
   responses, the Location is that of the new resource which was created
   by the request. For 3xx responses, the location SHOULD indicate the
   server's preferred URI for automatic redirection to the resource. The
   field value consists of a single absolute URI.

All the configuration is in text files (*.cfg, *.aut).  Just copy them
over to the other server and then start up Xitami.

Error 2140 When Starting Service With Parameters (Q136711)

 From the The following message appears when you attempt

selecting the service and specifying values in the Startup

Are you sure that IIS is not already running on port 80

just a thought..

Hi Russel,

I seem to recall having a similar problem some time ago when I was evaluating
Apache and Xitami on a server that also had IIS installed. You must ensure that
both IIS and the IIS Admin service are stopped.

My problem turned out to be that another process was already using one of the
ports required by my Xitami configuration. Try using "netstat -a -n" and
'netstat -a' to see if something else is already using port 80 etc.

Paul




Well, I completely uninstalled Xitami, removed it as a service, reboot the
Server and then reinstalled Xitami as a service again.  Still no luck - getting
the same "Error 2140".

Does Xitami use any files from the IIS Admin service? or from the FTP publishing
or the WWW Publishing (all parts of the IIS) - I currently don't have it
running.  An odd thing did occur: when Xitami didn't start (the first time all
these problems began), the IIS webserver did start.  Thats never happened before
- I do know those services were on manual so I am baffled as to how they
started.

I have done all the basic things and yet I can't get my Xitami service started.

HELP HELP HELP.  Don't know what to do here.

  Hi Russell,

  Check the xitami logs and see if there is an error in there.

  Remember that a lot of changes don't take effect till you reboot ...this means
on a machine that runs for long periods, that changes made last week don't occur
till this week when you reboot.

  The vitamin log should tell you if there is an xitami start problem and what
it is.

No it doesn't.  

But if you have IIS installed and Xitami installed, both with their
default configuration they won't both run at once.  (Both try to be the
"default webserver" and there can be only one.)  Try ensuring that IIS
is _not_ running and then start Xitami.

Yeah, I have tried it 6 ways to sunday and keep getting the same error.
And, I have no values defined in the services Startup Parameters for the
Xitami service.  Does Xitami use specific NT system files to run - or is it
self contained.  I am wondering if another NT system file Xitami needs is
corrupted.

Could a corrupt defaults.cfg or defaults.aut file be causing this?  My cfg
and aut files look fine but sometimes you never know....if Xitami can't load
a defaults.cfg would it then fall back to Xitami.cfg?

I reverified that all IIS services are "disabled" at boot time, and I have
deleted my "defaults.cfg" file thinking it may have been corrupted.

In what order do the files load.  Does Xitami.cfg load as well as
defaults.cfg?  Or does only the defaults.cfg load.  I am really reaching
here but I am trying to figure out why Xitami crapped out and won't start
again, even after a fresh install.  The only thing I didn't do on the fresh
install was delete the old defaults.cfg file.

Well, it turns out my defaults.cfg file was corrupted.  As soon as I deleted
it and Xitami reverted back to using Xitami.cfg the server service started
back up again.  Now I need to rebuild main config file - ugh! 17 domains to
rebuild....

Thanx for the help guys.  This was an odd one and it wasn't so obvious
either.

kewl, rebuilding the config file took two seconds....Xitami discovers the
individual *.cfg files for each domain.  So after wiping out the
defaults.cfg and then going to the browser based admin page, Xitami still
saw all my different domains.  All I had to do was recopy the Xitami.cfg
file over to a new version of the defaults.cfg file and then edit the VH
section.  17 individual lines and its all back online now.

I never had to go through these processes before so some of the above
revelations you guys have probably already had - first time for me.

xitami.cfg loads defaults.cfg, and defaults.cfg generally loads your
virtual hosts, etc.  I'd definitely suggest looking in the error logs
for Xitami to see if you can find the reason it won't load -- xitami.log
is probably the most useful one to start with.

This is what I did for my Mandrake 8.1 system,
put this in /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

echo "Starting xitami"
/var/xitami/xitami -s -w /var/xitami
#Syntax: xitami [options...]

#  -w directory     Working directory for server
#  -r directory     Root directory for web pages (webpages)

#                   Xitami on port 5080, do 'xitami -b 5000'
#  -f directory     Root directory for FTP files (webpages)

File permissions under Windows 98 are non-existent.

The answer to your question is that you can't.

It can't.  Windows 98 doesn't have any notion of "executable" in the
same way that unix systems do.  Instead anything that is *.exe, *.com,
*.bat, etc is considered executable.  Xitami also considers any script
that starts with a "#! interpreter" type line in a cgi-bin directory to
be executable.

You don't need to set the permissions as you have access to everything

Im using windows 98. I have no idea what 'programs' i am supposed to use :) 
Very open to suggestions here :)

Ive got MYsql installed correctly and it runs fine from the ms-dos prompt 
(thats what its supposed to do right?)  Cant get PHP working for the life of

I get the feeling that this is not an xitami list question though...so if

If you uninstalled and reinstalled Xitami, go back to the folder
and make sure that the Xitami NT Service account under
which Xitami runs ... has read and write permissions to
/Xitami/ and all child folders.
Furthermore, if PHP is installed, the /PHP/ folder has to 
have the same NT account permissions as does the Xitami
folder.

Subject: [Xitami] intranet - with internet login access
Message-ID: <111e01c1bbd7$ec850d70$2f28a8c0@RCOPC7>

i have a website
(intranet) that i want to allow people in the office to have access to
without needing to enter a password. i have remote people that also need
access - they should be prompted for a password and allowed access -
thus preventing others from accessing the page.

the "fix" that was given was something about using an alias. have
the real url accessible to the office by using a webmask - then having
the alias protected by password. i can't get this to work correctly.

does some one know how to do this - can you give me some help or tell me
another way to accomplish this?

thanks!

You are aware of the [Filter] section in the defaults.cfg.
You may have to set c:\PHP in your path too.
On NT, assign the same NT account to the Xitami folder, the NT service 
and PHP folder.

I don't think too many people are going to give you a hard time about
setup stuff. This is a pretty easy going list ...

Simple DNS by JHSoft.  You can download it at www.jhsoft.com.

Very robust. Very simple to manage, especially if you manage both the
primary and secondary server.

Very stable.  It has never failed me.

first you need to download and install php

next open the 'defaults.cfg'  file under the 'Xitami' folder and add

[Filter]
    .php = "C:\\PHP\\php.exe"

I have been running Simple DNS Plus under Windows 2000 for a year now with
no problems or hickups.

It works just as well under Win98 SE, but then the problem is the stability
of the operating system.

Simple DNS under Win2k gets the job done, minus the hastle that you
encounter with overly complex Microsoft DNS server.

Using your ISP's DNS IP's is great for surfing the web.  But that doesnt get
a domain name pointed to your web server's IP address.

If you want to point www.YourDomain.com to your domain server you will need
either a DNS server, or a DNS service.

DNS services are popping up everywhere.  My domain name registrar just
started offering the service just a little while ago.

I am on a dynamic ip address, using dns2go to direct domain request to the
IP of my router. The router forwards to the SimpleDNS IP which translates
the request to an internal IP address for each domain. Right now I have 10
sites on 10 ip addresses and email hosting too. I have been using SimpleDNS
the whole time with out any problems. Now if there is another way to do it
without using a DNS server that's ok too. But the question was whether or
not there is a free or shareware DNS server out there and we answered that
question. Whether or not it's the best thing to use is another question
altogether.

And for all you Linux/Unix users, some of us just have never learned it so
it's not an option.

Sorry for the venting......

Thanks for your time.

BulkRegister.com is my registrar.  I have over 300 domains with them.  Their
service isnt spectacular, but it is there and you do get call backs and
answers one or two days afterwards.

They have an initial membership fee, but if you are going to transfer or
register more than 10 domains it makes up for itself.

I have not used their DNS service, but it is available.  It wasnt a year ago
when I started using JHSoft's Simple DNS.

The only drawback of Simple DNS is that their tech support team has gone
awol in the last few months.  They used to answer within the hour.  Now they
dont answer at all.

YOU ASKED:


Who are you using as a registar? Yeah they are popping all over the
place... I am using registerfly.com for the time being.  However be
warned I have open trouble tickets for over 1 month now and no number to
call. Arg... Next registar please...

I really haven't needed their support since I set it up in Dec but they were
there when I needed them then. I don't recall how long it took to get an
answer. Maybe I was wearing the right color of shirt at the time.

Actually, I think Register.Com allows me to do this.

It certainly does allow you to do all of this and quite abut more. I'm 
fairly impressed with them although they occasionally exhibit some 
wierdness with their email service,

Message-ID: <NGBBLLHPELKGGCABCJJNKEDJCAAA.j.scullion@ayrcoll.ac.uk>

 Under Win 98, I've created a folder called c:\xitami\webpages\upload.  I
want users to be able to upload files to it using HTTP PUT.  I've added this
entry to the defaults.aut file:

[Upload]
 all=*
 http-put=1

This hasn't worked - I'm still getting "Status: forbidden" when I try to
upload.

Can anyone help out?

Hello everyone,
Xitami running great. Question about custom error message. Seem to work on
some but not others. Can't do a custom 404 error message. As per manual I
tried the following url: http://i602.com/error?413 and I got my custom error
message, but when I tried http://i602.com/error?404 , I got the generic IE
error page 404. So it seems like it works with some, but not others. Is this
because of browser (I am using IE 6)? anyone else got the custom 404 to
work? Thanks in advance for anyone's assistant.

If you want to see the web server generated (404, etc) error messages
in IE you have to disable "friendly error messages".

Subject: [Xitami] NEWBIE QUESTION : Building LRWP example with VisualC++
Message-ID: <v01530500b8a0e3108c4a@[193.190.195.125]>

Hello !!!


I am a new user of Xitami and I am very happy of it, but I have a problem
using LRWP, could anyone help me ??? Any assistance would be greatly
appreciated ! The problem is the following one :

I try to build the simple LRWP example with VisualC++ but the
compiler/linker is never happy, always mentioning more problems and asking
for other files, headers... I am lost now and I can't figure out what
exactly should be in the project and what should not. Could someone let me
know what ".c", ".cpp", and ".h" files need to be in the project ?

By advance, thank you.

Greetings from Belgium,


        Jean-Marc

Wow... thank you. That is so strange. Is this setting checked off as
default? Cause if memory serves, when I used apache server and custom error
message it showed up. Maybe when I upgraded browser it automaticly checked
off the friendly error message. Well, either way, thanks. My xitami crashed
a couple of times and I got a crashed once and log as follow inside "crash
log":

Abort at smthttp:Wait-For-Socket-Input: (Master-Input,

I don't know if anyone could use the above or know what it means... it did
create the memtrace.lst file (4 gig), I did research history of list and
found what that was and deleted it and created one and tagged it "read only"
to prevent future occurance. If anyone can use the above, great. If anyone
knows what it means and how I might be able to prevent in future, even
better. But it hasn't crash since and I am quite happy. Thanks again. Ke

If you want to see the web server generated (404, etc) error messages
in IE you have to disable "friendly error messages".

I figured it out that apache actually "forwards" to an HTML page instead of
generating one. That's why it worked even with "friendly error messages"
checked. Any way this can be done with Xitami? So that it forwards to a
valid HTML page, so IE never knows it didn't exist? I found out that the
friendly error IS by default checked off... so majority of the people will
never see the custom message. Thanks for the help, that was insightful. Ke

I've given up waiting for an answer and have installed Apache. Had a few
minor setup problems but the same php now works fine.

Alan is right.
I've been watching this closely for someone to respond.  I have had the
problem on my system, but never had time to sit down to try and figure it
out.

Although, I will not be installing Apache.  I like Xitami too much.

There is a Xitami bug about case sensitivity and aliases which I have 
found. This could be related perhaps? The problem I have found is that 
if your OS is filename case sensitive (e.g. Linux) then you are hosed 
because the alias detection code goes and lowercases the path and the 
alias to check for a match.

I don't used PHP so I can't say whats wrong there but I will say that 
the Xitami alias matching code is perhaps not the best written part of 
Xitami. If you downlaod the source code then perhaps you can figure out 
what the difference is.

Francis,

I run Xitami on my NT 4.0 server, so the case sensitive part should not come
into play.  Although I do watch case anyhow.  An old *nix habit.

There are no problems addressing html in the alias directory address, the
only problem I have found is addressing php in the alias.

Just one thought. How does PHP know where the page is? I'm guessing that 
environment variables such as DOCUMENT_ROOT will not be pointing to a 
useful place.

What happens if you create a dummy PHP document in a directory that 
corresponds?

E.g. say I have http://website/alias/myscript.php

Where Alias is mapped to c:\alias\ but the standard webpage root is 
c:\xitami\webpages\

What happens if you create a directory and file 
c:\xitami\webpages\alias\myscript.php which prints something like "HI 
you made to the DUMMY page"?

Do you still gte a blank or do you get the "DUMMY" message?

Francis

I few years back I bought a Linux distribution which had the option of
loading FrontPage Extensions on it. Since Linux runs on so many Internet
servers perhaps giving that portion away for free was a way that
Microsoft could get into the market?

If it was not just for MS how could one load FP extensions for Xitami?

Thanks

Hello Marie180,

I think it's PHP&MYSQL problem.
Check up following:
1). Version PHP. If PHP is older than 4.0.5 that is necessary for extension " php_mysql.dll " (read PHP install.txt). In any case it is necessary to customize PHP (php.ini).
2). If You have FireWall, open access to MYSQL servera  ports.

AFAIK, Xitami passes the .php-file which is to "execute" directly to the 
php.exe as a command line parameter and simply returns the output.
This problem is known for some time, though (several month), and there 
has not been any real workaround. If you are forced to use aliases bad luck.
I solved the problem by using virtual name-based hosts instead of 
aliased directories if the files are i.e. located on a file server. This 
works fine (as long as you won't use aliases below the virtual hosts 
level, of course ;-) ).
So the problem seems to be in the alias codepart of Xitami so that it 
won't handle any files which are to be passed to a program (i.e. filter 
like php.exe) correctly. I didn't try if perlssi or any other filter 
works because php is the only filter I'm using.

Thank you for the clear explanation. :)
I will consider your suggestion. For now, I am ok with .PHP in
same folder as .HTML
The virtual named hosts will work too as compared to aliases.

The last time the Xitami authors answered this question they said that they
had no intentions of reverse engineering to accomodate Microsoft's
propriatary work.

I think you can use the "Publish" feature of Front Page to put up the web
site and the subsequent versions.  This is no different than uploading
through an FTP connection, like Macromedia Dreamweaver uses to publish.

What you wont be able to do is manage the live site.  You wont be able to
log on with Front Page and browse the live folders in a Xitami web site, and
use Front Page's many management features.

You also wont be able to apply their "Themes", which make a lot of the
tedious formating work go away.  If you know CSS then this is not a problem.

This is actually a blessing in disguise: Macromedia has the right approach:
You should never fiddle with the live site.  You should only update the
latest version after testing the changes locally.

Also, Cascading Style Sheets make your site easier to manage than Front Page
extensions.  As long as you know CSS and HTML well enough, you are better
off than using Front Page's formating features.

YOU SAID:


I few years back I bought a Linux distribution which had the option of
loading FrontPage Extensions on it. Since Linux runs on so many Internet

I wasn't looking into having Xitami to support it.  But I was curious if
anyone knew how to support it if they had to seeing that a Linux

Ah the dreaded HTML message! :-) Seriously...

What do you want to do?  E-mail to fax?  Fax to e-mail?   Or I just ran
into this last night while surfing... Webpage to fax?

Yes, I have used them both for over a year now with Xitami and it works
fine.

Yes, but you have to use a scripting language like PHP or Cold Fusion(with
XiFusion).

If you want to use PHP you have to have PHAkt loaded into UltraDEV.

You'll have to use an ODBC connection language to use both languages since
neither language directly supports StarOffice ADABAS.

Subject: [Xitami] Keep Alive Max counter does not get decremented
Message-ID: <NEBBIJGPHKNLMOCJIHFJOECODAAA.dmitry@transnexus.com>

We are using "SSL/Pro Web Server v2.5b4".

Given these values in the defaults.cfg file -

[Server]
    keep-alive=1
    keep-alive-max=200
    timeout=3600


In the HTTP headers, "max" is always 200.  Is this a (known) problem?


It seems like "http_refresh_context" always resets "p_http->keep_alive_max"
to the configured value.

After making a few add-hoc changes -

1) removed call to "http_refresh_context" from
"smthttp.c::resolve_virtual_hostname"
2) removed call to "http_refresh_context" from
"smthttpl.c::http_init_context"
3) added   call to "http_refresh_context" to
"smthttp.c::initialise_the_thread" (right after calling "http_init_context")

"max" starts to get decremented for every response on the alive connection.

Thank You,

Dmitry

Hello Folks,

I do not know if this question has been asked before, searches found no answers so I thought I would ask.

When you create a virtual host and have it completly setup, how does one deligate administration of that virtual host to the site
owner ?

What we would like to do is allow folks that "own" those virtually hosted sites, manage it themselves for adding, removing users,
and protecting pages.

Any help in this matter would greatly be appreciated.

Thanks for time,
Roberto

One doesn't.  There's no concept of "virtual site ownership" in Xitami;
the system administrator owns them all.  You can set up FTP accounts so
that other people can upload files to the directories used by a given
virtual host, but that is about as close as it gets.  (With some
trickery you could let them edit the virtual host configuration files in
an editor and upload them like this, but this would probably be a
security risk too.)

Go into the router's IP forwarding tab and set tcp ports 80 and 21 for

What is about the WBA parm /setup ? As far as i Understood, this should allow a user 
to have restricted rights focused to a virtual host. !??
