First a neat little link from a good 3 years ago:

http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/business/0,39023166,20262449,00.htm

I'm especially fond of this little quote: "Xitami is another story: The 
Xitami server decimated its competition."

But enough of that and on to the question: I've got a PHP script running 
on an Apache (Linux). I've tried to move it to Xitami (also Linux - same 
machine), but when running via Xitami the session wont work. It works 
flawlessly on the Apache.

Is there something one should be aware of when working with Xitami, PHP 
and sessions?

Regards,
Thomas

Assuming you mean the admin password then you need to look in the
defaults.aut or xitami.aut file in your xitami directory.

IIRC the default user and password (in defaults.aut) for [/Admin] is
username = admin, passowrd = admin

Inside Xitami directory open and look inside defaults.aut - it is a text
file. Inside it look across: [/Admin]

Going home and won't be here to answer any further question tonight.

Check out the file xitami.aut. Here's a quote from that file:

When you install Xitami, the initial password is '-', meaning
'no access'.  We don't like default passwords.  You should change both
the user name and password to something safe.

Now locate the Admin=- line and delete the - and place a proper password 
there.

That's all..  :o)

Message-ID: <07da01c5234f$7f28dc60$8428a8c0@rcolmstead.com>

with plain xitami (no php, perl, etc)... is there a way to restrict certain
parts of the website to only be viewed if the visitor comes from a certain
referred link? for example - i have small pics i use for avatars on
webforums...  but i find many leachers hotlinking my images. is there a way
i can restrict this in xitami or do i have to use some scriptings.

basically i want to control people hotlinking my images. i'd also like to
make some images only viewable from certain sites (say i post in image on a
forum, people can see it if they visit the thread, but if they just browse
my website or try to hotlink the image elsewhere, the image won't show). i
dont' think a webmask will work for that. any ideas or input?

thanks!

Hi Ron,
I started getting cracker attacks like that from the same Hong Kong  ISP 
a few weeks ago.
 I downloaded, but have not installed PHP-BBS so they just got a 404.
Now I'm not sure I should install a BBS.

A number of my users are no longer able to FTP with my server since
updating their machines to Win XP-SP2.  I would like to suggest
compatible XP-firewall settings to them, but because I'm not familiar
with Windows products, I'm unable to offer them any valid support.

If any of you have detailed instructions or links on this topic that
you would like to share with my users, I would greatly appreciate you
passing them along.

Thank you

Hi Folks:

Whenever I or anyone else attempts to download a file from my Xitami server
using Internet Explorer, only a partial file is downloaded: usually about
180K. If, however, I use an FTP client, it seems to work well. The problem
is, that most of my clients use IE to download files from my server.

Could anyone tell me how to resolve this problem?

Thanks all over the place gang.

If this happens with slow connection it is a problem with the last versions
of xitami, that uses a timeout of 32Kb in 10 sec. (about 32kbits/s).
You can solve with a previous version of xitami or with the recompiled exe i
did some time ago that seems to solve this issue. this is the message i sent
last september....


I recompiled everything under visual studio 6 (and i get no error or
warnings...) with the modification i tried. I uploaded the new exe, here are
the urls; i put these online so everybody can test if this works:

http://web.cheapnet.it/leo.db/xisrv32.exe

http://web.cheapnet.it/leo.db/xigui32.exe

http://web.cheapnet.it/leo.db/xidos23.exe

http://web.cheapnet.it/leo.db/xicpl32.cpl


obviusly this version are NOT directly from Imatix, but i changed only two
constants in two .h files (if you search messages in late august/sept 2004
you can find more)

hope this help

Thanks for your help.

I was able to access all of the files via the links you provided accept one
link which is:

Which is as it should be; however, neither you nor the other posters to
the thread bothered to trim off material that was not pertinent to the
answer.  Top posting is particularly singled out for opprobium precisely
because it leads to shoddy thinking and failure to trim trailing
material; it is that lack of trimmin that really upsets people.

Oh get over it, you are complaining about the stuff the geeks from 20 years
ago complained about. Come to the present folks. Look I hate having to go to
the bottom of the email to read the response. I prefer the reply to be at
the top, if I want to read the original email I will scroll down to do it
but most of the time I already know what is in the original email. And all
those >> drive me crazy. They muddy everything up and makes it hard to
figure out who has what comment. Netiquette, is that you answer an email
like you answer a letter. If you are forwarding a letter to someone you
don't doctor the original up with >>> or anything else. I will give you the
removal of the extra stuff on the bottom, but frankly I rarely get that far
so it doesn't bother me.

Subject: [Xitami] problem with php and mySql
Message-ID: <EHEDLAEILNAJKFGNNOLGEEAECAAA.antonio.angelo@poste.it>

Hi all!

I try to connect to a mySql database with a php page, but receive a warning
message that states:
"Client does not support authentication protocol..."
What's wrong?
Thanks!

In a different machine a similar connection (IIS; mySql 4.1.6gamma-nt; php
5.1.2) is OK, but I need to work with xitami (or a different free server,
running under Win-XP Home).

Detailed information:

My environment:
Windows XP Home Version 5.1 (Build 2600: Service Pack 2)
PHP Version 4.3.10
Xitami 2.5c2
MySQL version: 4.1.10-nt

Process mysqld-nt.exe is running.

>From phpinfo:
MySql support enabled
Client API version  3.23.49

Phpinfo runs OK, like other simple php functions.
Mysql queries are OK for the specified user/pwd.

In my php.ini, in Windows Extensions section, I read:
;Note that MySQL and ODBC support is now built in, so no dll is needed for
it.
(in fact in php.ini there is no extension=php_mysql.dll, commented or not)

The warning arise only when I specify a valid user and any password which
length is greater then zero.

Source testmysql.php file:
---------------
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

<html>
<head>
  <title>TITOLO</title>
</head>
<body>

<?php
$link_id = mysql_connect('localhost', 'theuser', 'thepass');
?>

</body>
</html>
---------------

Refreshing the page, gives the following warning message:

Warning: mysql_connect(): Client does not support authentication protocol
requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client in
C:\xitami-25\app\webpages\memo\_testmysql.php on line 10


Thanks!

I'm glad to say that I have not; there again, I never responded to him in
the first place!

It sounds as if he's rigged up some sort of autoresponder that trawls the
headers of mails that he received.

> Can we do anything about this?

Learn how to read his mail's headers, and make *effective* complaint to
his ISP.  Complain also to the owners of the domain in which his web-site
appears.

Also, NOBODY should answer any future queries from the little shit.

> I am annoyed.

I would be too.

Subject: [Xitami] XML stylesheets (and PHP MySQL problem reply)
Message-ID: <opsnyi9hllxifng9@mail.nycap.rr.com>

Anyone into XML?  I'm just delving into it, really great stuff!

I have a problem though, with XML stylesheets (of the cascading variety).   
I have a very simple XML file that displays just fine.  I then insert

<?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="mystylesheet.css"?>

as the second line of the XML file, so that the external stylesheet will  
be applied to the display of the XML file.  I get an error stating "The  
function you requested is not implemented" when I try to visit the xml  
file via Xitami.  The XML file displays just fine (with the included  
styles) when I visit it via file://c:/etc/etc/etc.  I only get the error  
when I try to get the xml via the server.

What function is not implemented, and can I implement it in Xitami?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Michael

P.S.  Gary, I'm still looking into your PHP/MySQL problem!

Subject: [Xitami] XML Problem Solved...and a response for JOSE D. MORA regarding XML problems
Message-ID: <opsnyj22roxifng9@mail.nycap.rr.com>

In the xitami.cfg file, I found a line regarding a Web Extension Agent  
(WSX) that is called for xml files.  The line(s) looks like this:

[WSX]
.xml=xixxml

My guess is that the Xitami WSX for handling xml files is fubar'd (I  
recall earlier someone said there was a known Xitami bug in parsing xml).   
I simply #'d out this line, and now Xitami doesn't mess with the xml file  
on its own....thereby allowing my css file to kick in.  Works fine.

Jose, disabling this might solve your problem, and let your flash snippet  
process your xml the way you designed.  Good luck!

I am interested as well. I have been testing it's use on a site that serves
an open-source commerce solution. It is good for trimming unwanted variables
from uri strings and them some... The solution I was testing is placing so
high right now (top five in the world for ALL search keyword/phrase criteria
in it's industry) that I am opening it up as a real store. I am at step
three of a rewrite scenario that will keep it there.

http://shoptoo.palaia.us/

The only drawback is that it requires quite a bit and can sometimes create
weird results. However, it still works and seems to boost the ranking in the
top three: MSN, Google, Yahoo

If it does, I will move my solution there. Thanks Xitami!!!

Subject: [Xitami] Mod_rewrite
Message-ID: <NFBBKNGGELNPLMHPBOCEEEKPELAA.ronack01@bellsouth.net>

Ok I asked this and it ended up as a reply on another question.

I use PHP almost exclusively and one of the problems with PHP and dynamic
web pages for search engines is the question mark. For others it's urls with
long strings (more than 3 arguments).  Some of the search engines (Google
for instance) will stop at the "?". Although Google says they don't. Google
does say however that they will not index long urls, including urls with
date or session strings. SEO's get around this in Apache with a thing called
Mod_rewrite and .htaccess, I don't use Apache so I have no idea how it
works.

So is there a way for Xitami to re-write a url? Maybe in the Filter area?

Example:  stuff.html =
"http://www.mydomain.com/staticpages/index.php?page=20050321140922470"

Ideas? Suggestions?

I do have a php solution that requires a new static page for each dynamic
page, but that to me defeats the purpose of having a dynamic website. Unless
I can figure out how to do it on the fly.

Antonio, I'm having the same problem at school. I'm using php v4.3, mysql
v4.1, and xitami v2.5. In one of my classrooms php w/ xitami runs fine,
mysql runs fine from the command line, but trying to access the database
from php produces the same error you get: 

Warning: mysql_connect(): Client does not support authentication protocol
requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client ...

In the room next door, with the same exact software setup, everything works
fine. The only difference between the two rooms is the hardware - older
equipment in the room where things don't work properly. 

If you get a clue about what's going on, I'd appreciate a heads up.

Michael 

-----Original Message-----

I try to connect to a mySql database with a php page, but receive a warning

"Client does not support authentication protocol..."
What's wrong?
Thanks!

In a different machine a similar connection (IIS; mySql 4.1.6gamma-nt; php
5.1.2) is OK, but I need to work with xitami (or a different free server,
running under Win-XP Home).

Hello,,,,  :) :)

Recently Microsoft provided a critical/security update for Window98SE, XT, etc.
The one in question is:   KB891711 [a fix related to ICON vulnerability(???), I think!]

This was installed on severzal W98SE systems and all seemed to be OK on systems that were not running Xitami. The computer with Xitami (W98SE) became unstable and crashed at random, unpredictable times during the day with GPFs at several different places---most of these were reported at:

             GPF in module USER.EXE at 0012:00000167

Information from the Internet (Search string : 891711) indicates this process has presented various problems. The KB891711 was installed as a running process and started after each boot.  MSCONFIG was used to prevent the process from starting at boot on the machine with Xitami and all is now stable.

It has been several weeks since this upgrade and only the noted problems found from Internet searches can still be found. Also, no comment from Microsoft that I can find.

Anyone else with this experience and/or information about a new method for this security upgrade?

Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!  :) :)

I have 4 systems running Win98SE, one of them runs Xitami.

I didn't experience any issues with Xitami itself, but all of the systems
became unstable; random crashes mostly (sometimes a blue screen, sometimes
a reboot).  Turning off KB891711 fixed it on all of the machines.

It may be an interaction with something else that's not well behaved,
though it's hard to believe since the 4 systems have little in common
besides Win98.

Regardless, removing the "patch" removed the problem.

Hello Gary,,,,and others :) :)

And, THANKS for the comments.

The comments that were found on the Internet suggested this might be the case even for my environment. But, it was strange to see only the Xitami computer to become instable in my case!!! I would have thought that all would become instable(???),,,just as Gary's environment...........OH WELL!! :) :)

And, this is in no way is to place Xitami at the root of the instability,,,,,Xitami runs GREAT.

However in my case it was only the Xitami machine with W98SE that became unstable. The "action and reaction effect" seems to point to the 891711 process as being the culprit causing the instability. 

After several weeks of Internet searches I could not find other comments that would define "why" or any "solution". My searches are probably lacking for the correct string or phrase,,,simply using the string 891711 plus adding phrases resulted in finding no "solution".

So, I was wondering if anyone in this forum has found anything further about this situation and perhaps a "solution".


The following lists further details of this environment related to the instability caused by the 891711 process and the Xitami computer.

In the beginning all systems with W98SE were low-level formatted, set for FAT32, and then W98SE was installed on all. Also, all machines include the same applications packages and use. In this environment only two applications were installed. Both are the same version of Word and Excel from Microsoft and are used strictly for office management. And, all are loaded with the same network settings, drivers, etc. 

In this case there are 10 computers on the LAN and one is Windows XP HOME edition. All others are W98SE with one using Xitami. All machines have been upgraded with all the Microsoft Windows critical/security upgrades available for these operating systems. As well as the 891711 upgrade.

The Xitami W98SE computer is stript down and has no other applications being used, even the Accessories were all removed, no games, no scheduled tasks, etc. It is strictly used as an Xitami type Server. No SSH, Cygwin, etc. type software is loaded to the Xitami (W98SE) computer.
And, noone uses this computer during daily activities.

It was only this Xitami computer that the 891711 process was causing the instability based on "action and reaction effect",,,all other machines are happily running the 891711 process.

Thanks for any further information, time, and advise!!!!  :) :)

Hey Xitamites,

Is it possible to setup Xitami in a way that makes it possible to load a 
different root document based on what time it is?

Basically I have 6 different root documents and I want to load a 
different one depending on the amount of seconds passed:

1-10 seconds = doc1.html
11-20 seconds = doc2.html
21-30 seconds = doc3.html

And so on. Today I do it with PHP and a simple include, but I would like 
to get rid of the overhead using PHP, so I was wondering if perhaps 
Xitami had some secret trick up its sleeve to help speed things up.

:o)

Use a frame on your index page. Then use a simple vbscript or javascript
load the frame.

Subject: [Xitami] virtual hosts
Message-ID: <4249DE6A.25214.7B7E3F@localhost>

I run xitami on my XP box at home to use for testing sites and pages 
before loading them up to their servers.

Normally I can simply put the site in its own directory in the 
C:\xitami\webpages directory and call it with my browser using:

http://hostname/directoryname

One of the sites I've inherited uses SSI, which I can run in the 
xitami root directory but when I call it using:

http://hostname/directoryname/index.shtml

I get an error printed on the page to the effect that the includes 
couldn't be found in the xitami root directory.

I could fix that by simply copying the necessary files there, but it 
would be messy and could lead me to load incorrect files to the 
site's server.

I thought I could set up virtual hosts on my XP box so that I can 
tell xitami where to find the include files. I am sure I can do that 
so I read through the documentation and found that I appear to need a 
DNS server on my machine to tell it where to find the virtual host.

i) Have I got that right?
ii) What (free) DNS server do people recommend for this fairly simple 
task? I've googled for DNS servers but found the results a little 
confusing.

I'll be grateful for any advice/recommendations.

Hello Charles,,,and others :) :)

Thanks for the comment,,,and the last search I did was several days previous to last Friday.
Using your link for additional information to form other google searches has found several articles about the Microsoft Announcement made by Jerry Bryant related to 891711 in some Microsoft Newsgroups.

And, yep,,,,it is there!!! Below is that announcement:

*********************Start of Announcement****************************************** 
Subject: MS05-002 on 9x and ME   3/25/2005 11:08 PM PST 
 
By:    Jerry Bryant [MSFT]  In:    microsoft.public.security,
                                   microsoft.public.win95.general.discussion,

                                   microsoft.public.windowsme.general       

Microsoft has received reports about issues with KB891711 on Windows 98, 
Windows 98 SE and Windows ME.  At this point, we have been able to confirm 
these reports and are currently working on a resolution.

Please note that by uninstalling the current update, the machine will return 
to a vulnerable state.  At this point, we are currently not aware of 
customer's being exploited by way of the vulnerability fixed in MS05-002 on 
Windows 98, Windows 98 SE and Windows ME.  If you need additional assistance 
regarding this update, please contact +1 (866) PCSAFETY. When calling, 
please indicate that you are having issues with a security update.

******************************End of Announcement***************************************

So, it is now wait and watch for a correction! Here is hoping this situation can be corrected in an operating system type file rather than a running process(???) !!!!

For those that would like to review a Microsoft newsgroup that the announcement can be found plus several replies to the announcement try the following:

  www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx

          Then elect +ENGLISH
             Then select +Windows9x
                   Then select Windows 98 General

The "search for" window was set with "jerry bryant" and the "search in" was set to "Windows 98".

The subject of "MS05-002 on 9x and ME" had 90 (plus) entries and the article by Jerry Bryant was the first one listed.

THANKS to all for your comments, time, and advise!!!   :) :)

Message-ID: <NFBBKNGGELNPLMHPBOCEKEMEELAA.ron@miplanet.net>

Hey I saw this cool webserver on TV today which was completly self contained
on a Thumb Drive. Just plug it in, install the drivers and it works. (only
for 1 site tho) comes complete with http, ssi, cgi, php, and mysql support.
Once installed when you plug it back up to that PC it will start
automatically. www.webservusb.com

It got me to thinkin'

What do you think? Do you think it's possible to put Xitami on a thumbdrive
and take it from one PC to another? Consider that 128mb thumbdrives are now
down to about $20.

Ron

P.S. I bought one.

What's the point of having one?  You would have to drag your DNS around
with you too.  I guess it would be useful for local development purposes
and then sync with the main server for vacations and trips, but not much
beyond that...especially with wireless being (more or less) ubiquitous.

That said, the Xitami GUI (non-service) will work just fine as-is and
hardly uses any space on any drive - basically leaving 126MB of space for
content.  I don't know if it would work, but you might be able to write an
"autorun.inf" file that runs the main Xitami executable when the stick is
inserted.  Xitami might crash on eject, though (if it was still running
just before ejecting).

Yes :-)
You would need to wright a auto start script file like those used on cdroms.
A web designer might use a thumb/jump drive hold their portfolio.

Oh it can use dynamic dns service like no-ip. Well I'll be testing it out
next week. My main purpose is to put a backup of a company website that I
administer on it then send it to the company. But when I saw it, it got me
thinking that xitami could do that too.

Thomas,

Ok so Xitami GUI version is the exact same download except you start it with
xigui.exe or do you even need that. Can you just start it with xitami.exe or
xidos32.exe. What do you think is the minimum that one would need? I assume
that you don't need xisrv32.exe?

xisrv32.exe is the NT Service version - you need Administrator/Power User
rights on the system to install and start Xitami as a NT Service.  The
xigui.exe file is probably the way to go.  The xidos32.exe version is going
to be a console version - not a good idea to pop up strange windows, IMO.

As to "minimal" - Xitami's really tiny to begin with - not much to chop
away.  I'd just install the whole package and be done with it.  That said,
I guess you could remove the documentation.

You'll probably want to turn _off_ logging to extend the life of the USB
device.  Flash RAM can only be written to so many times before it wears out.

The trick is to jigger the USB drive so that it supports "autorun.inf"
- see http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/usbfaq.mspx

Burning a CDrom copy of your website including Xitami and putting an
appropriate AUTORUN file on the Cd is pretty trivial and I have done
so following the instructions below (more or less)

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_basics/shell_basics_extending/autorun/autoplay_works.asp?frame=true

It might be possible under XP to get the autorun to work on a USB
drive by adding a section to [DeviceInstall] but I'm not sure - I
guess the answer is to try it and see.

Thanks Thomas, I'll try it out on my thumb drive, now to look into getting
