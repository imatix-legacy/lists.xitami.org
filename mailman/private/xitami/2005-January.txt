I think I'm finding the source of my slow downs. Crawlers and the worst
right now is msn bot. But I'm also seeing Yahoo Slurp. Which normally I
woudn't mind them indexing my websites but when it is affecting the server
then it's a problem.

Try putting a "robots.txt" file in the root of your website with the 
following:

# robots.txt file to stop indexing of site
User-agent: *
Disallow: /

That will exclude all robots, I'm not sure I want to do that because I would
like to be included in the Search Engines. Is there a time setting that can
be applied. Like Excluding the robots between 7am and 11pm?

Ron,

I am curious, what ver of Xitami are you running, IOS, and what kind of 
system are you running it on.  You mention Xitami slowing down b/c of the 
crawlers, but it is Xitami or is it system performance trying to service the 
bots?  Just trying to get some clarity on where the actual problem lies so I 
can A) know what to look for and B) try to correct or prevent the same issue 
from happening to my system.

Sure,

I am running an AMD 850mhz processor with 1.04gb of memmory on a Windows
2000 Pro with all updates and service packs. My Xitami ver is v2.5b5 running
12 websites and I have done all required updates. I have Perl, PHP (latest
update), MySQL, and Cold Fusion installed.

Just a note, It appears to be the MSN bot that causes the problem. I can
reboot and be fine until the msnbot starts back up. Once the bot was
finished things seem to go back to normal. I may disallow the msnbot for a
week or so to see if it resolves the problem. I don't see that I can limit
the time when the bots hit the server. So I may have to do a batch file that
changes robots.txt twice a day.

Here is the log from when it pretty much died.

Just read this on a forum, it seems others are having problems with MSNbot.
Ok most don't want to be EXCLUDED from MSN but like me they don't want
MSNbot to eat up our bandwidth. They had several solutions.

======================================================
HELP! MSN Bot Eating Up ALL my bandwidth!!!


MSN Bot Statistics for the month of May (up to May 15th -- only 15 days of
stats!!!)

msnbot64047.search.msn.com:
bandwidth: 7625158 Kbytes (7.6GB)
files: 166806
hits: 167027

This is 29.4% of my sites bandwidth this month just from MSN Bot! Yesterday
alone it used 1.3 GB bandwidth!

By comparison, Googles bot(s) have only used about 1.4GB total bandwidth
this month.

How can I stop MSN from killing me! At this rate itwill use 15 GB this
month! Just from being indexed

Just read this on a forum, it seems others are having problems with MSNbot.
Ok most don't want to be EXCLUDED from MSN but like me they don't want
MSNbot to eat up our bandwidth. They had several solutions.

======================================================
HELP! MSN Bot Eating Up ALL my bandwidth!!!


MSN Bot Statistics for the month of May (up to May 15th -- only 15 days of
stats!!!)

msnbot64047.search.msn.com:
bandwidth: 7625158 Kbytes (7.6GB)
files: 166806
hits: 167027

This is 29.4% of my sites bandwidth this month just from MSN Bot! Yesterday
alone it used 1.3 GB bandwidth!

By comparison, Googles bot(s) have only used about 1.4GB total bandwidth
this month.

How can I stop MSN from killing me! At this rate itwill use 15 GB this
month! Just from being indexed
============================================================================

Ron,

I am curious, what ver of Xitami are you running, IOS, and what kind of
system are you running it on.  You mention Xitami slowing down b/c of the
crawlers, but it is Xitami or is it system performance trying to service the
bots?  Just trying to get some clarity on where the actual problem lies so I
can A) know what to look for and B) try to correct or prevent the same issue
from happening to my system.

-Russel

My system is Pentium 4, 1 gig DDRAM2.0, 2 dual 250Gb data drives (mirrored) 
with a 40Gb IOS drive that has 10Gb set aside as virtual memory.  I am 
running Win2K Advanced Server and Xitami ver2.49d.  MySQL, PHP, Perl and am 
running about 18 sites at the moment.  My server is a work horse but by the 
sounds of the MSNbot it won't matter b/c it will be killing the bandwidth 
more so than the system.

Good research and great info about the msnbot - I read the whole thread and 
got more than I was expecting.

Question: I am surprised but I have never even heard of the robots.txt file, 
could you send me a copy of yours so I could see the proper format?  Where 
does it go?  I def. want to restrict the msnbot from my server until I can 
properly understand everything and be able to determine the best time to 
allow it back on later.

Thanks Ron.

Seems Googlebot is ignoring the robots.txt file, I can see other bots hit
the file and obey it but the Googlebot just keeps on hitting the server.

Here is what I have in my robots.txt file
----------------------------------
User-agent: *
Disallow: /comment.php
Disallow: /submit.php
Disallow: /forum/createtopic.php
Disallow: /calendar.php

User-agent: msnbot
Disallow: /
------------------------------
Yet this is in my log

66.249.66.51 - - [12/Jan/2005:10:21:11 -0500] "GET
/submit.php?type=event&mode=&month=04&day=23&year=2004&hour=8 HTTP/1.1" 403
0

------------------------------
My next step is to exclude it in the Webmask= area, I am using a text file
called webmask.txt. My question is the format of the ip? Should it look like
this

!66.249.66.51,

or like this

'!66.249.66.51'

Does the ballbat (!) exclude or include.
Do I need the ballbat?  (I know it's an exclaimation point but it's easier
to type ball bat).
How about the single quotes do I need them?
The info in the xitami.cfg isn't clear to me.

Thanks,
Ron

Yeah, Google will ignore that since it never existed before, Google tracks
whether or not you have ever had a robots.txt file and won't look for it
for a while.  What you have to do in the interim period (Google will
EVENTUALLY look for a robots.txt file) is to set up a
"no-follow,no-cache,etc" META tag in those four global PHP pages to keep
them from getting indexed (Google DOES pay immediate attention to METAs).
Between METAs and your robots.txt file, you should be able to stop bots
from accessing those pages.

Good info I'll give that a shot. I would rather not exclude Google from the
server. I want to be found on the Search Engines.

Hi Ron

I use a txt file as well. Have a look below

here some lines of my txt file which is working here at my place

webmask= !211.*
webmask= !216.239.244.98
webmask= !216.136.85.161
webmask= !217.236.57.66
webmask= !218.150.163.30
webmask= !221.232.128.2
webmask= *

# 195.92.95.61 netcraft
# 209.237.238.*  ia archiver

even the comment lines are okay in there.  Just make sure that the last entry of all lines 
"webmask" is set to webmask= * like in my sample. Xitami reads the file from top to bottom, each 
line separate, and to ba able to allow all other addresses except the ones with !  the entry has to 
be there. In other words: first all disallowed IP's and then free entry. 
Hope this helps


Johannes

PS.  I found that the ia archiver is very pesty and is NOT obeying the robots.txt. I had to 
occasions were thex explecitly (hopefully correct spelled, not my native language) downloaded 
picture files from directories which were disallowed correctly.

I forgot to mention:  Some bots intentionally follow disallowed pages.  So,
make sure only pages that are actually referenced on the main site are
included.  You can test for which bots try this by including a bogus,
non-existent page in the robots.txt file (requests for the bogus page will
generate 404's - should be easy to spot in the logs and in log analysis
tools).

Thomas and Johannes,

Thanks for the info, my slow down problems seem to have gone away with the
exclusion of MSNbot. MSNbot obeyed the robots.txt file immediately (at least
it looks like it). As far as Google goes, It hasn't yet obeyed the
robots.txt file and seems to be ignoring the meta tag. I will work with the
meta tag a little more. One problem is that I use one header for every page
(php include). So the meta tag for robots can't go in the <head>.

Ron

Hi Ron

I use a txt file as well. Have a look below

here some lines of my txt file which is working here at my place

webmask= !211.*
webmask= !216.239.244.98
webmask= !216.136.85.161
webmask= !217.236.57.66
webmask= !218.150.163.30
webmask= !221.232.128.2
webmask= *

# 195.92.95.61 netcraft
# 209.237.238.*  ia archiver

even the comment lines are okay in there.  Just make sure that the last entry of all lines 
"webmask" is set to webmask= * like in my sample. Xitami reads the file from top to bottom, each 
line separate, and to ba able to allow all other addresses except the ones with !  the entry has to
 
be there. In other words: first all disallowed IP's and then free entry. 
Hope this helps


Johannes

PS.  I found that the ia archiver is very pesty and is NOT obeying the robots.txt. I had to 
occasions were thex explecitly (hopefully correct spelled, not my native language) downloaded 
picture files from directories which were disallowed correctly.

sure. don't mean to squat on this thread, but it has worked so well for me, 
i can't resist.

http://www.keyfocus.net/kfws/

i found the administration aspect easier than xitami.  and from what i 
remember having used Xitami a few years ago, its much more stable too.  i 
like never even think about it.

regards,
bill w.

I have been a loyal and faithful user of Xitami for years now...but I truly 
don't care for the administration of Xitami - that is one aspect that has 
NEVER improved and looks like they are never going to improve.  That being 
said, anyone else ever use this Key Focus webserver before, the 
administration and multi port feature look attractive.  But no FTP, which is 
another thing I had hoped Xitami would fix, and no SSL with Key Focus.

Do you mean this 'keyfocus'?

http://www.keyfocus.net/kfws/

If so, I must say that I am a Xitami fan. Plus KeyFocus has it's own
vulnerabilities.

This list really doesn't like non-Xitami promoters (for obvious reasons -
it _is_ a mailing list for Xitami).  I've been sort of relegated to "Xitami
advice columnist" status here because of former activity on this list
similar to yours.  Might want to tone it back a _teensy_ bit just to keep
the hardcore Xitami fans happy.

That said, they have an interesting server with a couple of features I
could swear they stole from Xitami and, erm, a couple other servers.  They
probably copied source from SFL as well.  Of course, as someone mentioned,
they probably have serious security issues that I'd be able to pick out
blindfolded.

Hi All
I don't usually reply to these articals, but i read quite a lot of them, i =

www.freedauk.com
www.peoples-tribute.com

and i have tried both xitami and key focus and by far the best one in =
xitami key focus i found to be diffcult to get the functuonally of the php =

diffcult to configure.
There said my bit.

I had a look at it yesterday, but I have to say that I like xitami over keyfocus. What I like most 
is, you unzip it ,no messing around with the registry and editing the necessary config files.
Ones you understand the way it's handeld, the changes are quick and easy done. It took me a while

And it seems to me that Xitmai has started to become a well known and
respected webserver.

I totally agree Johannes.

I now run 16 domains on virtual or dedicated xitami servers and toss out 260
Gb a month easily over those domains.

Two of my domains have an expected hit ratio of 1,000,000 plus hits per year
with 3000 images in catalouges
and some are only used for company related extranet data solutions.

I have had ONE failure in the past three months and that was my mailserver
hanging and had nothing to do with the domains.

One of the machine I had not even rebooted for 3 months with Win 2K on it.

Stabile and simple are the keywords.

I am having a bit of trouble here.

I have ActivePerl 5.8.6 installed
Xitami 2.5c2 installed on Win 2k

and I'm trying to get   http://www.radinks.com/upload/
this little thing to work in the lite edition free version.

Now everything is ok as long I try using the html-perl.htm file to do an =
upload but=20
it fails stating there is a error on line 62 in the upload.cgi file.

the following is the CGI file I am using.

Any hints as to why it won't upload to my xitami box?
I really don't know any Perl myself to debug this thing in a proper =
manner.

Thanks for any help.

I should have added this too...

Error in the CGIErr.log of Xitami is noted as=20

print() on closed filehandle OUTFILE at D:\xit\cgi-bin\upload.cgi line =
62, <fh00001E%3A\testimage.jpg> line 23.

the line number refers to the 23'rd line in the image file.

  Subject: [Xitami] Folder permission issue or PERL error???


  I am having a bit of trouble here.

  I have ActivePerl 5.8.6 installed
  Xitami 2.5c2 installed on Win 2k

  and I'm trying to get   http://www.radinks.com/upload/
  this little thing to work in the lite edition free version.

  Now everything is ok as long I try using the html-perl.htm file to do =
an upload but=20
  it fails stating there is a error on line 62 in the upload.cgi file.

  the following is the CGI file I am using.

  Any hints as to why it won't upload to my xitami box?
  I really don't know any Perl myself to debug this thing in a proper =
manner.

  Thanks for any help.

I posted a second one in here with the err log too...

It reads
Error in the CGIErr.log of Xitami is noted as

print() on closed filehandle OUTFILE at D:\xit\cgi-bin\upload.cgi line 62,

the line number refers to the 23'rd line in the image file.

there is like one for each line in the originating file selected for upload

Subject: [Xitami] Help about/with GSL perfomance
Message-ID: <20050114164722.96708.qmail@web13423.mail.yahoo.com>

Ive been using Xitami as a test server since 2 years
ago. I have always used GSL to parse XML files with no
problems.

But now I have a large XML file (110 KB) working in
combination with a RIA made in Flash Player, and it
simply doesnt work. After a few attemps, I discovered
that GSL wasnt parsing all the file; it seems to be a
lack of memory problem, causing an uncomplete parsing.

I kindly request any help, for finding a solution or a
workaround for this problem. I must say that there is
no option of reducing the XML file: it consists of a
whole list of codes for the National Archive of Costa
Rica, about 90 printed pages...

I have an additional question that may seem silly here.

In regards to this little applet. Is there any particular place in the
default.cfg file I need to specify folder permissions for the web server it
self to make the directory writeable???
I can for the life of me not recall such an entry anywhere. Any help is much
appreciated as I need to get this thing working and I have no clue as how to
proceed beyond this point.

Thank you.

I seem to recall you have discovered a known bug. I found a few other
GSL related bugs when I tried using the GSL interface a few years ago.
I gave up and used perl instead because GSL proved to be unstable and
unpredictable. Perl works fine, however you do have to disable the XML
addin in the Xitami config file

I don't need GSL exactly, but I don't know how to turn
it off. My XML file wouldnt need to be parsed by GSL
or any other app, because it is parsed by the Flash
application.
I'd thank if you or anyone else tell me if there's any
option of disabling GSL via configuration.

To disable GSL processing of XML do the follwing:
In your Xitami.cfg you should find the WSX section end edit it to look
like this:
[Wsx]
    #   Preloaded WSX agents
    .gsl=3Dxixxml
    .map=3Dxiimap

I thank you the quick answer, thanks a lot.
I almost reached the solution, but I mistook because I
had commented ".gsl=xixxml" instead of ".xml=xixxml",
I didnt try any more.

Subject: [Xitami] Folder permission issue or PERL error? <- making my own... new question
References: <EE5D17F9BCAE5645B246C3307D8550720C77D4@mailsrv.dalan.local> <00d001c4fa0f$87763160$c901a8c0@mrjx> <000c01c4fc8a$7e7e0150$c901a8c0@mrjx>
Message-ID: <007f01c4fced$0c4ce070$c901a8c0@mrjx>

Since there was no response to this that could bring clarity to the issue in
Perl, I'm writing my own file upload exe.
Now I just have one single question left.

As I stated before (this appears to be the problem) The read/write
permissions...
Is there any particular place in the default.cfg file I need to specify
folder permissions
for the web server it self to make the directory writeable???

I would be sincerely greatful for any help in determining where to specify
this option in this case.

I seem to be able to write files and their contents without a hitch to the
CGI-BIN but thats
not where the file need to be in the end. I need it to go into a directory
under the root folder named "webpages"
and this does not seem to work. I keep getting a windows error 76, filepath
not found, allthough I specify it in
hardcoded form with a absolute path value.


    Thanks for any tips and hints at all.

There are no specific folder permissions in Xitami.
webpages: root folder for internet web pages
cgi-bin: root folder for executables.

The error you get can be caused by trying to access the file by two processes, 
or failing to release the file handle or, ...

Thank you Marc.

Oddly enough I am having a very odd error in my Visual Basic CGI too.
I know for a fact I am releasing everything in a proper manner in that
application.

However, I do the full file upload, perform a very sloppy multipart
form-data
parsing at the present, but catch the full contents of an image file.

When I write the file to disk, it will save it anywhere I tell it to.
However, when I look at the link in a html document or try to
open the image in the web viewer on the server, I cannot see the image.

It is as if it was corrupted in the upload.
Then I ftp in and download it again, and open the same uploaded file in
ACDSee
image viewer, and the image works again.
It is probably the most odd thing I've ever experienced since 1996.

Clearly I can write files to the serverside but not view them afterwards.

Thanks for the help though, it clarifies some issues I've experienced.

I use CGI-BIN very extensively (i write complete applications in cgi), but 
until now never had any need for uploading files. The application runs in a 
LAN environment, so there is no real need for uploading files.
On location, i mail the files that need to be "uploaded" to a special 
e-mail account, and my mailserver decodes the attachments and put the file 
in the requested directory. Users use this feature to print documents on 
the corporate printer while on location.

Instead of Visual Basic, i use Power basic, the syntax is nearly the same.
My first applications were in Visual Basic, but i switched because VB is 
too "bloated" for a simple console application. Increased development speed 
and reduced maintenance. Can't use the fancy debugger when running cgi-bin.

I'll try creating an upload application next sunday. Maybe i will encounter 
any abnormalities.

Marc

Thank you Marc.

Yes I know this of the debugger too.
The CGI template I use has extensive error tracking built in so I get any
error codes and such tossed back to the html output if there are any and
there normally is.
In this case though, I use my File API code to read and write the files so
it should work fine writing it on XP executing it on Win 2000.

You can try getting it from =

Do not cross reference to other sites since this is just some temp help =

I will perhaps build a proper mirro on one of my machines when I get =

It opens and extracts fine for me.

Yup.  This is a known issue with Xitami and Squirrelmail.  You will have to
replace all relative redirects with absolute redirects to get it to work as
expected.

Subject: [Xitami] Trustix Linux and Xitami
Message-ID: <41F18CFF.4010508@kenshi.dk>

Hello,

I could use a bit of help installing Xitami on Trustix Linux 2.2. I'm 
not much a Linux wizard, but I figure it's worth learning something new. :o)

I've downloaded the package from xitami.com, unpacked it and fired of 
the build.sh file. I get a whole bunch of errors like these:
boomake: line xxx: c: command not found

And then suddenly one of these:
libsfl.a is missing, cannot continue

Then some more:
boomake: line xxx: c: command not found

And then these mixed with plenty of the boomake: line xxx c: command not 
found errors:
libgsl.a is missing, cannot continue
libsmt.a is missing, cannot continue
libstu.a is missing, cannot continue
libxac.a is missing, cannot continue

Finally it ends with this:
xitami is missing, cannot continue

Now, as stated earlier I'm no Linux genious so these errors means more 
or less nothing to me. Perhaps someone out there could point me in the 
right direction?

Thanks!

Subject: [Xitami] Firewall/Routers & UDP
Message-ID: <11689a7005012209244939b6e7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've been using Xitami for the past three or four years, both for FTP
and HTTP purposes.  Throughout this time, I've achieved satisfactory
results, simply by forwarding ports 21 and 80 [TCP only] from the
router to the applicable PC, and opening TCP ports 21 and 80 on the
software-firewall installed to that machine.

What troubles me however, is that I constantly find myself reading
posts on various message-boards which have been written by people of
questionable knowledge, and with unknown skill and experience, about
the set-up and configuration of Xitami and similar web-servers in
general.  Quite often, they specifically instruct the user to open
incoming TCP **AND** UDP ports 20 (???), 21, and 80... but ALWAYS fail
to explain why.

I admit having very little understanding of UDP protocol... and
because I have very little trust for my information sources, I've
refused to open any incoming UDP ports (or port 20) for Xitami's use.

Is it wise of me to keep unnecessary ports closed, or am I just being
paranoid, and robbing myself of true optimization and efficiency?

The only time I have had to allow anything special on any firewall setting
was for the DNS servers to open and they should be the only part that
requires both TCP and UDP ports to work. Thus port 53 must remain open.

A word of caution is that if you don't know what you're doing on DNS you may
allow recursive searches which can pose a security issue in BIND dns
versions below 4.9.10 and it is by default set to allow recursion on all
versions.

For Windows DNS this should not be a problem but it gives you less control.

They also specify that Zone alarm standard version is not a good alternative
for a firewall on a server however, I have had people run nessus scans of
servers with only ZoneAlarm Personal edition installed and in the regular
mode they cannot break through it and get kicked all the time. Besides, a
proper nessus scan will take several hours to perform so the likelyhood of
remaining undetected is limited, as ZA also logs every IP hitting anything
and anywhere.

If you use DNS, Xitami and SMTP/POP3 server on machines with ZA you should
specify "allow unusual servers to run under high security" in the advanced
properties but nothing else than this.

Unless you're doing p2p systems for Extranet services or something, there
should be no reason to allow UDP, but I could be wrong on this.

TCP port 80 is all that needs to be open for HTTP.

I have not used the Xitami FTP server much, but the following applies to =
any
FTP server.

TCP port 21 must be open.

Port 20 is the FTP data port, which is used with an active FTP session. =
For
a FTP server it is not necessary to have this open since the server will
initiate it with an outgoing packet to the client. But, to use active =
FTP,
the client must have port 20 open in one way or another.. Usually done =
by
port triggering (outbound 21 will trigger inbound 20). If port 20 is not
open on the client then the client will get an error when they try to =
send a
command.

For passive FTP sessions, usually you can specify a range of ports to =
use.
For passive FTP to work, the server must have these ports open and
redirected to the FTP server. For example, you specify that you want =
passive
FTP to use ports 13000-13100, so in your firewall you would redirect all =
100
ports to your FTP server IP.

UDP ports do not need to be open for HTTP or FTP.

So to summarize, TCP 21 and 80 need to be open. And for passive FTP to =
work,
a specified range of ports must be open as well.

I looked at the Xitami configuration screen and did not see any open to
specify what range to use for passive FTP.. Maybe someone else can =
enlighten
us on how Xitami handles that.

Hope this helps.

Steve

Message-ID: <41F2AF5A.1020802@kenshi.dk>

I wrote to the list earlier about my troubles with building Xitami on a 
Trustix 2.2 Linux. This issue has now been resolved thanks to Elliot and 
his fantastic xibuild.sh script!

I found this little gem on what looked liked some sort of collection of 
"old" Xitami maillist emails. I simply cannot understand why this script 
isn't a part of the official download from Imatix. It worked right out 
of the box and Xitami is now running  happily on my EPIA powered Linux box.

THANK YOU ELLIOT!  :o)

If somebody else out there are having the same problems as I had, feel 
free to email me (thomas@kenshi.dk) and I'll be sure to mail you the 
xibuild.sh file, unless of course Elliot tells me not to.

Sincerely,
Thomas

using the Current Release 2.5c2 and it runs on a P2-400 using win2k and 32MB
of RAM

what can I look at to see why this might be happening and resolve it.

thanks,

/David

Are you running with FTP enabled? I had the very same issue, and after I 
stopped using Xitami's FTP the random crashes stopped.

Probably not Xitami's fault.
32MB is really low to run w2k. The OS need 256 MB to run as smoothly as 
possible.
What's in your system's log (my computer/manage/events log) ?

Xitami logs told me that everyday at about the same time, MSNbot would hit
my sites spidering everything, every picture, every link, and every day in
the calendar doing multiple sites at one time. This would slow everything
thing down until my system froze up. After a reboot a few minutes later it
would start back up again. I had to create a robots.txt file and exclude
MSNbot. I have read that MSNbot will eat up your bandwidth to the tune of
several gigabites. If you have to pay for going over, it could get rather
costly.

Subject: [Xitami] How to disable LRWP?
Message-ID: <1106680613.7e0292ff7f130@mail.bg>

I just installed the Windows build of Xitami. I'd prefer to
disable the LRWP agent, but for some reason I can't. Edited
defaults.cfg to have "enabled=3D0" (without the quotes) in
the [lrwp] section, this didn't work, then edited
xitami.cfg with the same result. By the way, disabling the
FTP server agent in this way worked, so I was editing the
right file. ;)
It is not a big deal, since the machine is for testing, but
I don't like to see a possible bug.
System: Windows XP Pro SP2, Xitami 2.5c2 service.

Thanks,
Boyan

Just a quick question:  You did restart the server after those changes?

Dynamically shutting down a socket server in the middle of running the
application hosting a socket server is not an easy task in C/C++.
Restarting may be the only way Xitami removes such things.  Deciding to not
start a core piece of functionality and then dynamically starting it later
is also hard (but not AS hard as shutting it down).

Sorry for the bad reply formatting, this digest mode,
convenient as it is, makes replying somewhat tricky.
Yes, I restarted the service, although I failed to mention
that.
A quick test today on another machine showed that the
console version (xitami.exe) does not exhibit this
behaviour, where the GUI version (xigui32.exe) runs the
LRWP agent no matter the setting in the .cfg file, just
like the service version does. Since all these executables
are in the same directory, they all read the same
configuration files.
Which means that there are some differences in the builds,
although the version of all three is 2.5c2.

Message-ID: <BAY16-F185FCE6223431C062B827DB8780@phx.gbl>

I'm grateful there is a Xitami help list...... thanks

1. I subsribed a couple of days ago and have not recieved any mailed news 
list yet.

2. I'm Xitami newbie and have several questions.

Xitami v2.5c2

I intend my Xitamin web server to be a home private web site, on dynamic IP.

- How do I password protect the webpages main directory, so only those I 
give user id and p/w to can log in from the internet?
I used "defaults.aug"
[/webpages]
    userid=password

- How do setup Xitami to allow cgi/perl scripts ot run from any xitamin 
directory?   I tried the suggesting at  http://www.scrounge.org/cgi.htm,  it 
didn't work.  So I have resorted to using cgi/alias directories.

-I'm trying to setup WebApps portal scripts  http://www.web-app.org/.  I 
have successfully installed WebApps for several websites on hosting services 
with Linux.
WebApps installation went smooth except runs fine locally.
BUT  my Xitami setup uses internal ip, which doesn't work with Webapps.  I 
need to have a wildcard to serve pages externally.
http://192.168.0.102/cgi-bin/index.cgi  (is how my current setup looks) and 
doesn't work externally.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami and PHP 5
Message-ID: <opsk8ui3zlxifng9@mail.nycap.rr.com>

I'm running Xitami 2.4d and PHP 5.  Both work just fine, except for one  
thing: PHP sessions.  When I run the following page:

<?php
session_start();
echo "Hello";
?>

I get an error telling me that "node no longer exists" in line 2.  I get  
that error anywhere between 20 and over 3,000 times in a row, per page.

I've been all over the PHP boards, and the gurus think it's not a PHP  
problem, but an Xitami one.  Does anyone have an idea?  Thanks.

Thanks.
I have replaced the relative redirects by absolute redirects. I do not get
an errormessage anymore (=Url does not exist) but now I get a blank, white
screen. Still something wrong?

Session variables set up properly?  PHP comes with some session-related
things disabled in the php.ini file.

Would like some suggestions.

Running Xitami as home network webserver
Win98se
DSL
Dynamic IP

1. Free SMTP server software
2. Free Dynamic IP update client
    (using hn.org [hammernode] for dynamic IP domain service)
3. Free PHP for windows source or software
4. Free MYSQL for windows source or software

I know I can dig around and find the above, but trying to save time.

Also I am familiar with WebApps Portal Perl/cg scripts (www.web-app.org), 
would like to colaborate with others on setting up WebApps on a windows web 
server, as WebApps doesn't support Windows.  *I'm not a perl/cgi script 
programmer, although I have stumbled through a couple of simple hacks.

Any help appreciated

No clue.  dyndns.org was the last free dynamic service I used.

www.php.net

   Use ZoneEdit as dDNS - they have scripts you can incorporate into a web
page style function call.  A quick look at hn.org shows they might have a
quick online reference. (see TOOLS).

You are not alone!

Is there really no one out there who knows? Or is Xitami perhaps a dying 
project so no one cares? Man that would really make me sad. I love this 
little piece of software. :o)

Hey guys give me a break ....
I'm so far behind in work it's not even funny anymore so
I just thought I was going to be able to catch up somehow...

Guess this didn't work huh (^-^)

(p.s./ 2004 was a bad year, I thought a do-over could have fixed it /d.s.)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed; x-avg-checked=avg-ok-7B8C12FE

Hello:

I have a web site that is available to an unknown size and growing group of 
people.  I want to make the site available to anyone who knows the 
password, but be able to supply any username so that later when I look in 
the log, I can see who has viewed what content.

Right now, I must manually add in the defaults.aut:

Thisuser=specialpassword
Thatuser=specialpassword
Otheruser=specialpassword

But oftent I spell the user's name wrong and they just get 
frustrated.  It'd be nice if I could just add something like:

*=specialpassword

Meaning, "accept any username, but the pasword must be 'specialpassword'".

Any ideas?

Subject: [Xitami] Password Protect Xitami site ????
Message-ID: <BAY16-F8BA1C1536C95F8342913AB87C0@phx.gbl>

Total newbie question
How do I password protect entire site , when user arrives at 
webpages\index.htm he has to put in a password, before anything loads.

I am assuming there is a way to do this via Xitami like the Xitami private 
directory user/pw setup.
I would prefer to do this via Xitami and not a cgi script, but if Xitami 
can't handle it then a script recommendation would be appreciated.

Also thanks to everyone for the smtp server, dynamic IP client, etc,  
recommendations.
Special thanks to Charles Schmidling, I am attempting to setup Mercury.

Thanks for ignoring my question about password protecting whole site.
Reading the documentation helps.  I guess I was tired when I read it before.
