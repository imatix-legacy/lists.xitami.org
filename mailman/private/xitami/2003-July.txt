  Hello everyone,

  I've got a problem (I think) and I'd sure like to hear from you guys as to 
what you think it is, and what to do about it!  I use one of the online 
hit-counter, "Sitemeter", that lets you check how many hits you have as well 
as where they come from and how long they stay.  Everytime I check it I"ve 
noticed that there is one particular ip address ALWAYS there!  At first I 
just thought that this person enjoyed my site, lol, and spent a lot of time 
there, but now I'm getting a bit worried about it!  What could this be?  Are 
they just linked to an image on my site, or are they spying or hacking me or 
what?  Also, how can I go about blocking that ip addy?  I have seen some of 
you talking about this in the past, and would really like to know what you 
think this is, as well as what to do about it!  Thanks to all of you in 
advance, and I hope you all are having a good day!  Happy upcoming 4th!

I'd do a reverse DNS lookup on the IP. If this fails, at least find out who
owns that IP block.
Compare that with the IP's used by Sitemeter, yourself, and any other
relevant IP addresses.

Do mean that the IP has always made a request, or that the IP has a port 80
connection that it sustains?
If it's simply that is shows up in you log every day, I would guess it to be
port scanner or trojan infected PC trying to find a way in to your server.
I get about 100 malicious requests a day on port 80 alone.

Tom

Speaking of Xitami being almost perfect, has anyone tried Sambar?  It seems
like Xitami and Sambar are the 2 most popular free/open servers.

I know this is slightly off topic, but I can't think of a better place to
ask, and it may open up additional threads.

Thanks!

If you were to install Apache, then put only your download section under
Apache, That would change your download:  access to resuming, and multi
links. When using a download accelaerator, it verifies the download while
putting the thing back together.. To access the other download page from
Xitami, is really quite simple,  just access as if it was an extension form
your own page, but at a different port. i.e.
http://www.yourpage.com/  is to your page under xitami   however
http://www.yourpage.com:8080/ is to the apache server setup for port 8080
and to handle all downloads, then when done comes back to the main page....?
or however you have it set up... I WISH xitami could handle those two
things... Other than that Xitami is perfect...

Hello !

Another "missing" feature in Xitami is the lack of ISAPI. This protocol 
seems to be getting a standard for fast cgi.
In the normal version of cgi-bin, when a user clicks on a cgi-bin page 
(pointing to an executable), a complete new environment is created for this 
executable.
This can take some time.
When using ISAPI, when a user request a dynamic page, the server calls the 
adequate routine in a DLL. This is much faster: no environment to create, 
and presumably the DLL is already in memory. But since the DLL resides in 
the same memory space as the server, a simple error in your DLL will pull 
the server down. When using normal cgi, an error in your executable is 
detected by the server, and it return an error to the client.
ISAPI is quite a mixed blessing.

You can password-protect directories, but it seems impossible to protect 
execuables.

Overal, Xitami is a simple and easy to use webserver.
Sambar is more up-to-date, has more features, but is more difficult to 
implement.

That would work if the server were setup with a direct connection to the =
internet. However, it sounds like it is behind a connection and/or =
router. In this instance the router must forward the request for port 80 =
to the server's ip address on your network. This way when a web request =

Hi there.
One of the purposes of a router and/or firewall is to hide your internal
PC's from the internet. So therefore any internal server is not seen from
outside. You need to tell your router to pass incoming and outgoing port 80
to your internal sever machine.
And, like you are currently doing, outside access must go to your public IP.
Internal IP's are not publicly routable.

Tom

Have you thought of reporting this as a bug to M$?  Not that they're
likely to do anything to fix it, but there might be the registry hack
you're seeking and they could put that into their knowledge base.

Remember, whilst M$'s support is chargable, they do refund when they
agree that it's a bug; and what you have is most decidedly a bug.

Have you tried the ISAPI Beta add-on for Xitami?  It uses LRWP (can't
remember if it uses LRWP 1.0 or 2.0 - neither version is that great in
either security or performance, IMHO), so if the DLL crashes, only the
connection to Xitami dies instead of the whole server.  The ProtoNova Web
Server has full LRWP 1.0/2.0 support as well and can run the same ISAPI
Beta Add-on module that Xitami has.  So, for all three servers (Xitami,
ProtoNova, and Sambar), ISAPI support exists...can't say anything about
Sambar's support for it, but it probably has "mixed blessings".

However, when it comes to ISAPI for Xitami (or ProtoNova), there is no
"mixed blessing" unless LRWP itself dies (I have yet to hear of this
happening...but not many people use LRWP because it takes some effort to
set up).  (BTW, the core ProtoNova server will keep running even if the
LRWP Remote Module dies).

>You can password-protect directories, but it seems impossible to protect 
>execuables.

Only if you stick your executables in cgi-bin.  Granted NT security stinks,
but if you implement it properly and you don't put executables in cgi-bin
(or any other web server accessible location), you are fine.  Now if you
can't trust the users on your system (assuming a VHosted type of
situation), that's a completely different story and you have more problems
than just protecting a directory.

>Overal, Xitami is a simple and easy to use webserver.
>Sambar is more up-to-date, has more features, but is more difficult to 
>implement.

Agreed, Xitami and ProtoNova are equally simple to set up.
Sambar isn't that tough to set up but tends to have the Apache
"look-and-feel," which I don't care for.

More importantly than ease-of-installation is security.  Instead of asking,
"How easy is this to install?"  The question you should be asking yourself
is, "How long does it take to secure this sucker?"  IIS takes about half a
day (IF, and that's a _BIG_ 'IF', you know what you are doing) or more (up
to 3-4 days) to secure it and apply all of the patches.  Xitami and Sambar
take anywhere from 1 hour to 1 day to secure.  ProtoNova comes secured
out-of-the-box.  Obviously, features like ISAPI are important, but they
shouldn't be the deciding factor as to the server of choice.  If security
and server stability are concerns for you, the following information was
compiled one year ago about various servers:

http://12.210.108.203:83/search.nvm?searchname=Web+Server+Comparisons

Even though I wrote that document, I gave each web server a fair trial and
did my best to be as unbiased as possible in the results.  The only bias
was the order in which I would choose a web server - Xitami still being
second to ProtoNova (for obvious reasons)...IIS is appropriately ranked
just slightly above servers almost no one uses or should use.

The funny thing about that document is that Ashley Brown herself (author of
iWeb) e-mailed me about why the iWeb server was ranked the lowest server in
that list...which says that people actually use that list to choose their
web server based on security, stability, and important features.  I figured
that no one would read it...guess I was wrong there!  The OP and others
will find the aforementioned document intriguing and a good read with a
focus on the right topics of, IMO, security and stability for side-by-side
comparisons of web servers (most web server comparison charts focus solely
on features - this one focuses on how the server works on the inside from a
security and stability standpoint as well as a deep understanding of the
Windows platform - definitely worth checking out!).

Please note that while ProtoNova is my personal server of choice (I wrote
ProtoNova and enjoy maintaining it), I highly respect the Xitami server and
iMatix and everything they have done thus far.  I have a few complaints
that iMatix already knows about, but even then Xitami still runs on port 80
on my machine and I have yet to see it crash under XP.

Hope this helps!

This helps greatly !

I will surely try the ISAPI for Xitami.
I'm running a lot of executables, and every day i have a log containing 
some 10 cgi-bin executables that died "mysteriously". I think they are 
timed out because they couldn't access some external ressource (like a smtp 
server or database) in time. If i was running Sambar, it would have caused 
the complete server to crash every time.

I've done it for several years on Windows, which is how it's running now:

domain.net
subdomain1.domain.net
subdomain2.domain.net
subdomain3.domain.net

But when I try to do exactly the same thing on Linux, everything I enter
goes back to first one - Is there something I'm missing?

Okay, it works with 2.4d9, but not with 2.5b4 or 2.5b5.

When I tried to upgrade to 2.5b4 from 2.4d9, I lost virtual hosts the same
way. Windows 2k for both versions.
I had to pull my 2.4d9 config off backup to get running again.
Anybody?

Now that would be immensely useful, but I can't see a way to do it except

It will be more and more difficult to block hot linking.
Hot linking relies on the HTTP_REFERER that is send out by the client with 
his request for a page or image.
Personal firewall and other security features cloak this information, so 
you could end up in refusing access to a legitimate page on your site.

I don't know about general hot link protection, I suspect its basically
impossible but using scripting it is possible to block access to specific
areas without the user logging on or without the user having been referred
from a specific page or ip address.

Files delivered in this manner can be stored completely outside the web
server so there is no possible way of accessing them directly.

Well it is doable.  On my OS/2 boxes that run Web/2 it filters HTTP_REFERER and 
blocks users that come from it's ban list.  I run a art site so it's a valuable feature 
blocking troll forums and porn sites that chose to hot link.  A few users don't give a 
HTTP_REFERER.  But most do.  So it works.  My Windows machines are running 
Xitami and I was wondering/hopping if there was a way to block on 
HTTP_REFERER and USER_AGENT to help curb some abuse.  Spammers are 
also sucking up more and more bandwidth every month (like dummified e-mail 
harvesters).  Ways to block abuse are becoming more and more needed (IMO).

Hi All,

I've been using Xitami for about 8 months now with plain HTML content.  I
now use Dreamweaver MX as my website development tool and would like to
begin to serve dynamic content now.  I suspect there are two ways to go
here, ASP or Coldfusion.

The question is: Has anyone been able to integrate Coldfusion or ASP
application server technology with Xitami.  If so, what is the least
expensive way to do this.  I don't want to spend 700 dollars on an
application server just for my limited needs.

As a practical example, on my website below, on the Drug Search Page, it's
currently a remote URL that is served elsewhere.  I want to integrate the
drug search feature right within the local website using the above
approaches so I can further customize the search feature and maintain
800/600 presentation, like the other pages.

  Hey Tom,

  Thank you for trying to help me with this!  I"m not sure exactly how to 
best answer you, but I'll try and I hope that someone can please help me 
with it!  All I know is that this ip address: "morrilton.net" is ALWAYS 
showing to be on my site!  Hours and hours at a time, and if it leaves, it 
soon shows back up!  When I click on the site information links at site 
meter, it does show admin info and contact etc. but that don't help me any, 
as I'm not sure what to do with it!  Are you saying that I shoudl contact 
that isp admin and tell them that someone from their isp is always on my 
site, and ask them if they are hacking me?  Or could it be they are linked 
to an image on my site etc?  I'm more afraid that they may have taken over 
my computer as a "host" for hacking, or that they have actually hacked me or 
something like that!  I wish I knew more about this, but since I don't  I 
really appreciate any and all help and assistance I can get here!  Thanks a 
lot and have a good day!  I just need to know what they're doing there all 
the time, and what to do about it!  What would you do? Thanks!

If you go to www.morrilton.net, you'll see that it's an ISP. Which means,
one of their users is doing something you don't want.
Now go to your logs, and find our what that IP is doing. If you find many
error entries, than he's probably trying to hack into your system.
First thing I would do, is change all your system passwords, including
Xitami admin. Then report this beahviour to morrilton.net. Sending log files
will greatly help your case. Then it becomes their problem.

If this IP is in fact doing legitimate requests, look into _what_ he is
requesting. Is it something you don't want him to copy/link to? If so,
report him to his ISP.

If all else fails, install a good firewall like ZoneAlarm Pro which allows
you to block his specific address. In any case, a good firewall is a must
these days.

Tom

Some tools I use (that are free) are here...

Also, Sygate Personal Firewall Pro seems to be better for
me than anyother firewall...

Good luck!

Re: Xitami and ASP / Coldfusion compatibility

I don't know much about the ASP and Coldfusion needs.  The PHP suggestion sounds good to me. Another alternative that I have been using is the combination Xitami and REBOL via CGI. I use Dreamweaver but now only rely on it for layout.There are some good examples on the REBOL site about how to run REBOL as CGI handler.

http://www.rebol.com/docs/cgi1.html

http://www.rebol.com/docs/cgi2.html

The file of drugs that you look at might be a database but if there are just a few thousand of them, you could hold them as a text file and let the CGI script load it.As an example, I can read 100,000 records of 121 characters each in 0.219 seconds.  For me, that is not much overhead unless your site is getting dozens of hits per second.

If you are getting a lot of traffic there are some Xitami approaches to hold the file in memory (using Xitami's Long Running Web Process LRWP) that work with REBOL. REBOL gives you some flexibility in how you can manage your data on a file if you chose to do that. There is also the ability for REBOL to access mySQL databases if you want to do that.  REBOL sells commercial versions that access other DBs. But you might want to start with the mySQL solution ($0).

Shining Light Productions' Nuclear Vision v1.1 is the freeware alternative
to Macromedia ColdFusion (a $2000-$5000 application).  Currently
implemented as a CGI (works under any major web server), v1.2 will
introduce LRWP (Xitami and ProtoNova), ISAPI (IIS), and Remote Module
(NVMLMod - ProtoNova only) support along with full E-Commerce support (via
the NVIMAGE, NVSESSION, and NVEXEC tags - along with modifications to NVWEB
for SSL-support).  NVML v1.1 can be obtained here:

http://12.210.108.203:83/search.nvm?searchname=Nuclear+Vision

That links to Shining Light Productions internal site, which runs on
Nuclear Vision v1.1.  Be sure to read the developer documentation and check
out the included NVML examples in the distribution.

Shining Light Productions also maintains XiFusion, a popular product that
allows Xitami and ColdFusion (NOT ColdFusion MX) to work together (and
enables other languages like PHP to work better).  Nuclear Vision works
under Xitami without requiring XiFusion.

Hope this helps!

Maybe...I've never tried.  It probably requires the ASP DLLs from IIS to
run it - and even then this solution will only work under Windows (if it
works at all).

Hope this helps!

I would agree that PHP is your best bet.  It works with Xitami easily, it's
FREE, and it works with MySQL easily (also free).  You don't use IIS, why
use ASP  ;-)

Can I disagree here?  I've written a good 10,000+ lines of PHP code in my
day and PHP comes no where near the simplicity of Nuclear
Vision/ColdFusion.  Since the OP is just starting into dynamic programming
(and maybe programming in general!), I suggested Nuclear Vision because it
has superior error messages...when the NVML scripting engine detects an
error, it spits out about 2-5 printed pages of information, with the most
relevant stuff at the top and the least relevant at the bottom.  For a
beginner to dynamic webpage development, this sort of thing makes Nuclear
Vision a superior language as PHP will _MAYBE_ spit out a one-line, cryptic
error message at best and nothing at all at worst.  ColdFusion spits out
errors at a slightly less caliber as Nuclear Vision, but is less organized
(IMO).  Of course, there are other reasons to not use PHP as a "first
programming language," but choosing a language with good error messages at
appropriate locations relieves many headaches.

Also, Nuclear Vision is freeware and integrates just fine with MySQL via
MyODBC.  This is where I have one other disagreement.  MySQL, while useful
for small websites, is not my DBMS of choice.  I prefer taking Access
97/2000 databases and using Access as a prototyping tool.  Then, when I'm
ready to go into production, I'll export my Access database into SQL
queries to use for importing into the production database (e.g. Oracle, IBM
DB2, MySQL).  So, for the OP, I recommend Access as it is easy-to-use
(versus the formerly recommended MySQL setup), but let me warn you that
Access SQL queries via ODBC take about 10-50 times as long to connect to
and execute versus a commercial-level RDBMS.  MySQL has never really
impressed me, despite the fact that I use it, but it is pretty popular and
can handle query loads that Access (Microsoft Jet) cannot.

Oh, BTW, whatever you do, be sure to upgrade your MDAC (Microsoft Data
Access Components) to v2.71 or you will probably experience weird errors
when you try to run SQL queries across ODBC (doesn't matter if you use PHP,
Perl, Nuclear Vision, or ColdFusion):

    Hi All,

    I've been using Xitami for about 8 months now with plain HTML content.
I now use Dreamweaver MX as my website development tool and would like to
begin to serve dynamic content now.  I suspect there are two ways to go
here, ASP or Coldfusion.

    The question is: Has anyone been able to integrate Coldfusion or ASP
application server technology with Xitami.  If so, what is the least
expensive way to do this.  I don't want to spend 700 dollars on an
application server just for my limited needs.

    As a practical example, on my website below, on the Drug Search Page,
it's currently a remote URL that is served elsewhere.  I want to integrate
the drug search feature right within the local website using the above
approaches so I can further customize the search feature and maintain
800/600 presentation, like the other pages.

PHP is optimal for small sites that have no future growth expectations.  My
old PHP-based website:

http://www.shininglightpro.com/

Has long been overdue to switch off of PHP to another scripting language.
That site is a beast to maintain and has thousands of lines of
compatibility code that I should never have had to write, but what really
crossed the line was that the latest versions of PHP kept breaking site
functionality (I have to keep an old version of PHP around just for that
site as "upgrading" would require re-writing thousands of lines of code).
PHP is optimal when nothing else is available (this is from a
professional/technical/business as well as my own personal standpoint).
Performance-wise, PHP compares well against most other scripting languages
(the ONLY thing going for it, IMHO), but this issue is being addressed in
the next few versions of Nuclear Vision and will put NVML on basically the
same performance level as most scripting languages.

Hope this helps!

I'll have to disagree with Thomas in some respects. It all depends on what
you are doing with the site. For instance if you are running a forum or a
Blog, PHP to me is the way to go. Of course I went with PHP when I couldn't
do ASP on Xitami, at least not on the cheap. And some of my sites are just
plain html and perl while others are PHP. And my nephew works with Cold
Fusion on his website (on my server). My PHP sites are Blogs and plans are
for these sites to become much bigger. So when Thomas says PHP is good for a
small site I'm not real sure what he means. What is the definition of a
small site? One that gets very few hits or one with very few pages? Take a
look at www.inreview.com It is a forum site with possibly a thousand pages
and thousands of hits per day. Also CourtTV.com uses PHP at least for their
forum.

Hello,

Im fairly new to Xitami but Ive had some success using Euphoria
http://www.rapideuphoria.com

Their are much better examples of scripts on the site listed above
just look for their Powered by Euphoria symbols throughout the
site.

Euphoria still doesn't have a posted Web portal system but word
is, there are some in progress.

If you look here: 
http://www.rapideuphoria.com/asearch.txt
this is a search engine produced by the author of Euphoria that
weeds thru 100,000 or so messages to retrieve info on your requested 
data.

I know Euphoria is very capable and is very fast (possibly the fastest
interpreted langauge ever written , with the capability that it has.)

What is needed are people who know CGI, HTML, DHTML, XHTML, XML
to whip up a great portal system. I would but I have too many irons in
the fire. I do have knowledge of Euphoria on a low level and could help
an adventurist...

Take a look!
Euman

If that is all you need to run (Blogs and forums), most of those things are
generally written in PHP and pre-packaged that way.  However, if you need
to do anything else (e.g. I have a site that is _supposed_ to support
hundreds of software packages, but can't because of PHP's limitations), PHP
is not sufficient as a scripting language for me.  When I say small, I mean
content-wise small, not usage/#-of-visitors small.  However, I should point
out that any site running multiple languages requires all of the people
behind-the-scenes to know all of those languages...which costs more for the
company as those people tend to get paid more than people who only know one
or two languages.  Nuclear Vision is easier to learn and use, IMO, than
PHP.  It is designed as a freeware ColdFusion alternative and not
necessarily a PHP replacement.  Anyway, the OP decided to use PHP...I was
just merely providing an alternative.

Hope this helps!

Have you tried WBSP (WhizBase Server Pages)?
It works with Xitami with no problems, web administrator can set different
setting for different virtual hosts, it is free for .org.xx and edu.xx
domains (for commercial use it costs 49.95 per domain) and it can be used
for many purposes (not just forums). Using WBSP you can create forums, CMS,
shopping carts, shareware libraries, mailing lists and many other things.
IMHO it is very good solution for building dynamic webs, and I believe that
anyone can create his first WBSP-powered database project in less than 30
minutes (with existing database, of course).
More info (and free download, with no forms and registration) can be found
at www.whizbase.com

Hope this helps.

I'm using Geeklog, www.geeklog.com it php based  has many themes, does all

it's all free.

Is it necessary to set the MIME type here, as the browser doesn't have to
call any external ap's to interpret it?  I haven't quite understood the idea
of MIME yet.

this will make a good read and help you understand it a bit more
I hope :)

but yes if the browser knows what's coming it speed things up
same on the server side...

unfortunately, to spoil all of your days, i am not female, sweet was
intended as a cry of joy, not as in a "come on line".

but it is rather nice to see that there are others who have a sense of

Message-ID: <21047541860FD411B4980050DA20CD3EE9C3@sol.lanfunosa.com>

Hi everybody.

First of all I have to say that I'm quite new with Xitami. I have a
little problem. I'm spanish and I need to show some spanish characters
like áàéèíìóòúù.

Is is possible to change something in the configuration of the Xitami
server to allow me to see those special chars?
I've checked all the windows config and nothing seems to be wrong. All
other software is able to show them. Only Xitami does not.

I have Xitami v2.4d6 and I'm not sure if I can install the actual
release as I have the problems using a third party software developer.
I'm using Win 2k Server on a Compaq Proliant server.

Thanks for all your attention.

Hello,

I've not used cgi in a while.
I am using virtual hosting, works well. FTP is off.

when I go to www.mysite/cgi-bin/testcgi.exe

I get URL does not exist.

If I create an alias to this folder, I can see and download the contents, to include the EXE.

cgi is turned on.

Any ideas ?

Hello !

You have to specify whitch directories contains executables, enabling cgi 
is not enough.

My ISP has recently blocked inbound port 80 traffic.

Is there a way to change the HTTP port to one other than port 80?

If so, how do you do it?

Thanks...Brian

Yes. You need to change the PORTBASE config value.
For example, if you want to move your xitami HTTP port to
9090 but keep your xitami FTP on 21, you would need the
following in your defaults.cfg:


[Server]
    portbase=9010                       #   +80 = 9090

[Ftp]
    port=-8989                             #   + 9010 = 21

Using web admin:

Main screen "default - server properties": check the main CGI directory 
(should be something like cgi-bin, but you can enter an absolute path)

CGI screen "defaults - CGI properties": check that CGI is enabled.

That should do it.
Dont forget: if you change anything, SAVE it (on each screen) and at last 
RESTART the service.


Hope this will help.

I got it to work. Yes, I had CGI turned on.
I restarted the service .. .but that didn't work.
Rebooted the box and it worked.

Where do you want to display these characters? If Xitami's dialogs and 
message boxes don't show them, I'd say it is not a big deal. If the server 
doesn't want to serve correctly web pages with non-ASCII characters, that's 
another story and is quite serious a problem.
So, what exactly do you want to achieve?

Hi Boyan (and everybody else).

My web pages must have this chars. When I ask for a report of my
application, some descriptions have this chars and what I see instead of
'Ã­' or 'Ã³' is always '#'.
Hope that answers your question.
I need help! People that use this application is calling me all the day
to see if I have corrected it.

Thanks everybody.

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but did you set charset properly in
<head> section of your web page?
e.g.
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=[character set
code for your language]">

This, of course has nothing to do with Xitami, but it be the problem if you
did not set it. I use Xitami with non-international characters and I never
had any problems nor I had to configure Xitami to use them. And I also use
dynamic pages (web application) written in WBSP (www.wbsp.com) and still
have no problems with those characters.

Best regards,
Faik

I suppose your applications (?) don't display the correct characters.
For instance, they use the symbol é instead of using the correct html 
entity &eacute;.

The number of available symbols like é è à ç (i'm using a french keyboard) 
is limited and depend on the codepage installed.
It is normal that some of these symbols don't display correcly on other 
systems.
Otherwise, the html entities always display the correct symbol.

Could you point us to a page containing display errors? This will help us 
track down the problem.

Hi everybody!!!

I'm doing some research. I have to check with the software manufacturer
how has he coded the webpages that have the incorrect chars. Anyway,
I've seen that the 'static' parts of the html are shown correctly, and
only the text that comes from the database is showing the wrong
characters.
Any ideas while I talk to my software provider?

Thanks to all of you. It's very good to see so many people interested in
other people's problems.

'See' you!!

As i said before, your html content shows up correcty, but the text from 
the database has to be encoded.
Special characters have to be replaced with their corresponding entities.

just to let all of you know. I had a few hassles getting the xitami to run
my php setup, but i found that after i edited the defaults.cfg to enable the
filters, it wouldnt take. I then went into my xitami web browser
configuration and found that it had listed the filter as c:phpphp.exe. didnt
make sense to me, as i had edited the file as per instructions. I then
edited the filter in the filters section, with the correct path, and
everything is running well. So thank you for your help, it was greatly
appreciated.

It appears that Xitami doesn't set PHP_SELF.

Haven't needed it till now, but now a set of PHP scripts require
$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']. I saw in the Xitami release notes that this was fixed way
back in 2.4b release of 98/11/08.

Is this a known bug or fixable via some configuration?

If it is a bug, I will have to abandon Xitami.

	Search the archives for this list, the subject has come up many times, with
many answers. Look for messages with "PHP_SELF" in the subject.

Hmm; had you perchance edited the file to say "c:\php\php.exe"?  I
suspect that, like many other files, if you *really* want a backslash to
appear then you need to write it as "\\".  (Since the sequence "\p" is
not a recognized character escape sequence, then the backslash was merely
ignored.)

There is NO NEED to include any backslashes in any filepath for Xitami,
even when running under an operating system that (ostensibly) uses
backslashes as path separators; this is because even Windows XP still
understands its oldest heritage and will happily understand forward
slashes as path separators (except on command lines, where the forward
slash is interpreted by the excuse for a shell as the introducer for an
option or switch).

So you ought to have had "c:/php/php.exe".

So: who told you to edit the file to include backslashes?

NB This is all conjecture on my part, but not, I think, without
foundation.

Thanks, Marcio. I originally _did_ look for archives for this list and didn't
see it referenced anywhere on Xitami.com. After you mentioned it existed, I
found it on lists.xitami.org. Then I was amazed at how these archives are
maintained. They aren't searchable and that I had to download a 16 meg file to
do a proper search for my question!

Anyway, doing a text-based search I found that were indeed "many many answers",
most of them mentioning that PHP_SELF was a problem going back quite a ways, and
never apparently fixed. There were a number of workarounds mentioned. I'll look
at these, but I'm dealing with a set of third-party scripts that I'd rather not
mess with. I'll probably test them out with Apache which works properly.

<RANT_ON>

If anyone from Xitami monitors this list, please note: why isn't the
lists.xitami.org link referenced on the support page on the .com site? And why
isn't the fact that there _are_ archives mentioned on the "Welcome" email from
this list? Why is it necessary to archive full headers, which accounts for the
vast majority of the 16 meg archive size? And most unforgiveable of all: why
aren't the archives searchable??? Doing text searches and wading through headers
and quoted text and html messages - rather than being able to view messages by
threads - is enormously inefficient.

I agree; it's also made worse by those that quote the entirety of all
earlier posts to the thread, usually bottom-quoting as well.  Have you
ever read <http://www.plig.net/nnq/nquote.html>, which is just as
relevant to a mailing list as it is to newsgroups?

Hello Brian,

<...snip...>

Couldn't  agree more. Further, it is a pain that a lot of the messages/posts
can't  be  threaded by reference because a few folk won't reply to a message
instead  of creating a new one. My lists folders are set to threaded view by
reference and they are littered with orphan posts.

OK Busted sorry about that didn't mean for a big fuss over it :)

[Filter]
    .php = "C:\\php\\php.exe"
    .phps = "C:\\php\\php.exe"
    .phtml = "C:\\php\\php.exe"
    .shtm = "perlssi"
    .shtml = "perlssi"
    .ssi = "perlssi"

I know there was a reason I use the \\ rather than the /, some things just did
not work right
but that was V2.4# and it's been like this since heck it may even had something
to do with
an older version of Perl,,,, or PHP

Yeah, a rare lapse.  I do usually bottom post and snip but I sometimes forget when

Actually the problem is not a problem but the developement of php past about
version 4.1 or so. The global variables were changed. I remember a way one
site worked around this, I'll explain and hope to make sense. At the top of
the page an if statement was included which check for the presents of the
$SERVER[PHP_SELF] variable, if it was the variable was equated back to the
regular PHP_SELF variable and the page worked fine.
Hope this makes some sense and I don't really remember who's code it was on,
used to many over the past year.
