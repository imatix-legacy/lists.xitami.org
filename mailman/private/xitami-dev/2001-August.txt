Which sources are you building, and on what platform?

Not really, no.  The main WSX examples are LRWP (which does keep a
little bit of state), and things like the SSI handler (which is
essentially context free).

If anyone knows of other examples they're willing to make available
we're interested too.

The IP address is from someone that is infected with Code Red virus -
and its trying to infect your machine.

But since we are on xitami - we are safe.

Code Red is a virus that takes advantages of the instability of NT
servers. Xitami doesn't have these holes.

Repeat of my post from yesterday, for people who missed it:

> /default.ida?NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN.....

Someone discovered that if you send MS IIS webserver a VERY long packet,
the end of the packet over-writes part of the webserver code. 

The "NNNN..." is just filler. The gibberish at the end is the worm. It
corrupts part of IIS and loads the Code Red worm. See: 

   http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-23.html

There are patches for IIS that close this backdoor. 

Other webservers (including Xitami) correctly reply "Bad request" and
don't get infected. The attack is very specific to un-patched IIS
servers. It relies on both a buffer overflow and specific locations in
program memory. Even if a webserver had the buffer overflow, on non-IIS
servers the subroutines Code Red infects are not the same, nor in the
same places.

The target of Code Red was the US White House site. After spreading to
many machines, on the first day of the month all those machines would
flood the White House site with packets, effectively shutting it down.

As a US EDU site operator, I was told that we have "...an obligation as
a good net neighbor to ensure that our hosts are not contributing to the
spread of this virus."

I believe that most responsible operators in and out of the US took
steps to block CodeRed, but a few may be somewhat sympathetic to the
idea of crashing the White House. And since one phase of the infection
puts up a web page saying "Hacked by chinese", sympathy may run highest
in some parts of Asia. Or they may simply not be reading all the news,
much of which is in english. 

The virus targeted White House by IP number. Knowing that, after the
first wave George's geeks moved the server to another IP number. That
dodged the bullet, but still there is excess network traffic as all the
copies of CodeRed try to find their target. 

If you are not running MS IIS: Forget about it. CodeRed can't infect
Xitami, nor spread from Xitami. 7 or 58 or even hundreds of attempts in
a day isn't hurting your server's performance. If you do get a flood of
attempts, delete your log files if they get too big for your disk.

It's the Code Red IIS Worm probes.  It doesn't bother checking webserver
types or anything, it just tries to exploit the server.  Xitami just
claims it doesn't know anything about it, hence no problems.

Expect it to become more common before it gets better -- in theory
there's another 15 days or so of spreading attempts left.

I checked the logs. First one was from a Korean business site at 22:30 
on 1 August (I'm at GMT+1000). Between then and when I posted the 
message to the list I had 52 entries, many with almost untraceable 
IP's.

Yeah, I read up on all this last night before I hit the sack. 
Fascinating.

I've only just got through the other one, where some bozo at my ISP 
kept sending me private information automatically, three times an hour. 
I had to specifically tell him to disconnect his computer from the 'net 
and contact the helpdesk.

I have a good feeling, but not sure, I thinkk it's Code Red Worm, which
doesn't effect Xitami, so I think you don't need to worry, except for the
large logs it can generate.

Yes, CodeRed had the idea of bombing the White House at midnight
on the first of the month.

Because it is a Windows worm and Windows can have a poor notion
of world time, and because many people neglect to set their Time
Zone, and because many people don't check the time on their
server, the "all at once" bombardment was spread over several
days. Still it was effective enough that White House was shut
down, and had to move to another IP.

If I'm reading it right, the same will happen on 1 September
etc., until enough people patch their servers that the infection
rate drops below the re-boot rate.  

(CodeRed dies in a re-boot, but if your IIS is un-patched and
there are a large number of active CodeRed machines in the world,
your IIS will be re-infected in hours.) 

(For big fun: it is possible for a IIS machine to have multiple
copies of CodeRed running (and each one is really 100 threads).
So an unlucky IIS machine can stall from all the load.) 

> some bozo at my ISP kept sending me private information automatically, three times an hour. 

Sounds like SirCam email worm. In fact I checked my mail today
mostly to see if "Glendaliz" had sent me yet ANOTHER one of
his/her awful files. So far I've collected: 

 Everyday I walk up down the same blocks.doc.lnk
 Leidner.doc.pif
 Maria V.doc.lnk
 Log 8.doc.com
 Assignment #1 (Dickinson).doc.com

I complained, no response; complained with copy to
abuse@rutgers.edu and got two more that night, then none in the
last 2 days. Either Glendaliz cleaned up the act or abuse killed
the connection.

Another person, who I do know, sent me 2 or 3 quite personal
financial files. (Do NOT try to read these files via Windows:
you'll get infected. Anyway you don't want to read other folk's
boring files.) A third person spared me but others were
complaining about him, so I had to scrub his machine.
