Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Trying to keep SMT and SFL
Message-ID: <GMEIJMPDFMEGPAGNKHKDKECICCAA.rafael.cano@o-labs.com>

 Hi Imatix.

 When will cvs.imatix.com be available again?.

 How fresh is the New Zeeland site, and why have
 the building files disappear?.

 How stable is SMT v 3.0 ( smtsock ) for building
 a production service?.

 How is the near future regarding SFL & SMT distribution?.

 Are there plans to extend the SFL library for XML functionality,
 like search and sort?.

 How can I pay you a beer for your good work?.

Not for a while.  We have decided that CVS was not a good way to 
deliver the Xitami source code, taking too much effort to build.  We 
will provide source kits as zip/tgz files.  At a later stage we may 
decide to make daily snapshots of the development CVS.

The iMatix NZ site will be absorbed into the imatix.com site.

It is stable and we are using it for production services.

>  How is the near future regarding SFL & SMT distribution?.

We are in the process of repackaging all our source code.  iMatix.com 
will have news once we are ready to go public.  Basically we will 
have packages for:

 - base tools (SFL, SMT, GSL, htmlpp, etc.)
 - Xitami 2.4 (including archaic SFL & SMT)
 - Xitami 2.5 (including archaic SFL & SMT)

plus Xitami 3.0 once that starts to become stable.

Yes, we have planned to make such extensions to sflxml.  However, I 
can't tell you when.

>  How can I pay you a beer for your good work?.

Come to Brussels and visit us.  We are always happy to share a beer.

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] referrer
Message-ID: <200206031155.NAA19269@sxpublic.nxrda.imatix.net>

a user thinks that he has discovered a bug in xitami. i'm
currently tracking it down but i'm a little bit confused. the
application is a webmail interface.

what happens ?

1) user presses "delete email"

2) webmail deletes the email and sends a "301 Moved" with a new
location to the browser

3) the browser requests the new location

4) xitami answers with "200 OK", but don't send the REFERRER
field.

5) webmail bumps the user to the login page because of a missing
referrer.

i have 2.5b5 in the debugger.

neither "put_standard_headers" nor "put_dynamic_headers" are
dealing with p_http->referrer.

any hints where to look ?

The referrer field is only returned if it is supplied by the browser 
in the first place.  First thing we need to do to understand what's 
going on is to enable debugging, then look at the request.log and 
header.log files.  Usually with that we can see where the problem is.

If you've done this, send me the two files and I'll see what's 
happening in Xitami.

Each one must be configured for a different base port.

You can do a lot with one copy and Virtual Hosts.

Providing they are in different directories, with different

Under Windows 9x you can run multiple copies providing (a) you run 
them from separate directories, since they will otherwise get 
conflicts on log files and such like, and (b) you use different port 
bases.  AFAIK you cannot run two Xitami services under Win9x, at 
least one of the instances must be a user process (started when you 
login).

Under WindowsNT/2000 you can run multiple instances as services, so 
long as you observe (a) and (b) above, and also set the Xitami 
configuration to use different service names.  This works far better 
than under Win9x.

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] read_TCP returns 0 instead of -1
Message-ID: <GMEIJMPDFMEGPAGNKHKDAECPCCAA.rafael.cano@o-labs.com>

 Hello Imatix.

 I am using lrwplib.c for a prototype LRWP application,
 wich will be later implementing the LRWP via an
 SMT agent.

 In read_full_TCP() in lrwplib.c, after calling
 read_TCP() reads the return code, and compares
 it to SOCKET_ERROR for errors. This macro
 is defined in sfl.h as -1, but when the socket is
 closed, for example when xitami is closed, read_TCP
 returns 0, making any application based on lrwplib.c
 go into an infinite loop.
 Changing the test against 0
 ...
 if (chunkLen == 0)
  return SOCKET_ERROR;
 ...

 fixes the error.

 A bug in sfl.h, lrwplib.c or read_TCP() ??

 I'm thinking of writing an ISAPI dll that
 accepts LRWP2 connections and acts as the
 LRWP agent in Xitami. Is this already available?
 ( I know there is the other way round, LRWP client
  calling ISAPI.dll ).

 Kind regards.

Hi,

In case anyone is wondering, the cvs.imatix.co.nz pserver anonymous CVS
archive has been removed, as the internal iMatix CVS repository is no
longer organised to provide a portion via CVS and is generally in a
state of flux as has been noted here in the past.  The cvs.imatix.co.nz
CVS was somewhat broken as a result of partial updates during some of
this transition so there didn't seem any point in keeping it around.

There may (or may not) be an announcement from someone else at some
later point as to how more recent (than the packages on imatix.com)
open source software can be obtained.

Message-ID: <F183xLJQHRWT5K5TEOY000140dd@hotmail.com>

Hi there,

I am just about to re-write a C++ version of the LRWP C library (out of 
frustration), capable of supporting multithreaded operations (under Windows 
for now).

Before re-inventing the wheel, I'd like to know if someone has already done 
this? A quick Google search came out with nothing on the subject.

IMHO, the fact that the current implementation of the LRWP C lib is bound to 
SFL (which requires single threading) is a mistake. While SFL makes perfect 
sense in the context of the architecture of Xitami, LRWP as a protocol 
should be designed with applications in mind and therefore should be 
agnostic to threading issues. This limitation is probably what has been 
holding LRWP back from being more popular (compared to FastCGI for 
instance).

Don't get me wrong. I *love* Xitami and how it is put together.

Regards,
Fabien.

Hi:

Being a fan of Delphi Pascal, I wrote an object library for LRWP 1.0 in 
about a day. It's
called a unit in delphi parlance. I did not need to use any other library. 
LRWP works
like a charm and I have many processes attached to a single XITAMI server. 
All use
that unit.

If you take the perl example and you have a good command of the C++ String 
object it should
not give you any problem.

 Hi.

 LRWP is a protocol, and has nothing to do with
 SFL, as a C callable library. All that has to be
 done is open a socket, read from and write to it.
 How you reach the WINSOCK library its not relevant.

 By the way, what do you mean SFL requires single
 threading?, I think it all depends how you build
 it, to which specific libc library you link it to
 resolve the basic WIN32 API functions, SFL calls.

 Has any one thought of building specifications
 for a LRWP 3, with compression and encryption?

 Regards,


 I miss Liberetto.

AFAIK no one has done so already.  (The implementations that I know of
are C, Perl (an example), Python and Java, plus some sort-of-released
ones for things like Visual Basic, etc.)

>IMHO, the fact that the current implementation of the LRWP C lib is bound to

The LRWP C library was the original proof-of-concept library, written by
Total Control Software, with minor updates as things went along.  By all
means rewrite it using something else.  The Java implementation (in the
form of the Sokrates Servlet Runner from Conacom, etc) is probably the
most complete multithreaded version.

thanks for this obvious fix. I'm using LRWP to create

That's my point exactly.
That's why SFL should not be involved in the LRWP C lib. You'd think that 
this could have been done the first time around ;-)

Not quite. Building SFL (and the other Xitami libs) with the  multithreaded 
C runtime libs under Windows ends up affecting Xitami negatively (dies after 
a few seconds or so).

I use zlib for the compression and BlowFish for encryption. But I have kept 
these layers separate from LRWP itself. It makes things a lot cleaner to 
reuse.

Anyways, I end up writing a C++ version of LRWP in about a day with a few 
performance optimizations regarding memory allocation and the ability to 
save posted data to disk.

Fabien.

huh?
I have build SFL and LRWPlib with the multithreaded C runtime (/MTd)
and use them without a problem.

Thanks Ewen.

I just finished rewriting and testing that library with a few performance 
improvements and a bug fix (read_TCP() has a bug causing it to not return 
SOCKET_ERROR when the connection is lost). C++ being my weapon of choice for 
system programming, I couldn't use Java at all.

Hi all,

As far as I am concerned, the bug is in read_TCP(). I had reported this 
problem to the Xitami team about 3-4 weeks ago. I guess I should have posted 
it here as well.

Really!? That's interesting. I just could not get it to work after changing 
the original VC++ projects for the various Xitami libs to be multithreaded. 
I wonder what I have done wrong. Can you post the compiler settings that you 
used?

Install Xitami.

Open a browser on the same machine, open http://localhost , there is
your site (the default Xitami sample page, which you will edit or
replace).

*some* versions of Windows are reluctant even to open "localhost"
until they check with a DNS server. Stupid, but MS never understood
the internet. But my dial-up WinNT4 machine can surf itself all
night long without trying to dial-out.

Add a file \Windows\hosts with:

127.0.0.1	localhost 

or just open http://127.0.0.1

You could even put other names into the hosts file:

127.0.0.1	myownsite.me

and then open http://myownsite.me

Chuck,

Install Xitami and open a browser.  Use a URL address of http://127.0.0.1.
You should connect to your site on the laptop.  I am assuming you are
running a version of Windows for an operating system.  If you don't have a
file called "hosts" without the double quotes in your Windows directory,
then create one and add a line to it like the following:

127.0.0.1   localhost           # point to my own machine

On bootup Windows will read your Hosts file and know that a name like
localhost is attached to a specific IP.  127.0.0.1 is universally known to
be the machine you are running from.

Message-ID: <F54rRHyQWwAJIlZ5cNw0001b598@hotmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a client app written to POST compressed and encrypted data to a LRWP 
process. The problem is that the LRWP process only receives a few bytes 
instead of the whole data stream. Basically, it appears that the WSX module 
xilrwp.c punts on the first NUL it encounters in the stream. POST'ing text 
data works like a charm though...

Looking at the source code, it would appear that this issue has been 
resolved already (as indicated by the comments at the top of xilrwp.c). But 
the problem still exists as of the latest 2.5 codebase...Or am I missing 
something?

Has anyone written a fix for this issue (I'd like to know before I do it).

Regards,
Fabien.

I use modules that process uploaded .jpg files sent to the server
  and did not have any problem. I have verified that LRWP can handle binary 
streams.

I use modules that process uploaded .jpg files sent to the server
  and did not have any problem. I have verified that LRWP can handle binary 
streams.

George,

Let me be more specific.

While you are right about a LRWP process being capable of *sending* binary 
data without any problem (I have tested that on JPEG files too), you are not 
correct about a LRWP being capable of *receiving* binary data POST'ed to it.

For instance, try to POST a JPEG image to your LRWP process rather than 
having it uploaded over FTP. You will not get what you expect.

The obvious workaround would be to UUENCODE the binary data, but I want to 
avoid this at all cost. There's no reason why a LRWP could not handle binary 
data.

Regards,
Fabien.

 Fabien,

 I am building a system that receives binary data
 in an LRWP connected process. No problem, use
 http_multipart_mem().

I stand corrected. The data had been converted to 7 bit when I received and 
I had to
convert it to back  binary. I am not sure whether the HTTP spec, which is 
based on SMTP, guarantees 8 bit transport. SMTP uses mime for that and so 
does http.

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Hummm...POST'ing binary data to a LRWP process *does* work after all :)
Message-ID: <F88Yhsl4OhAt8zqzjkn0001bf89@hotmail.com>

Hi all,

Thank you Rafael for pointing me in the right direction :)

After much reading (of RFC 1521) about "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" 
(and looking at a raw dump of a HTTP file upload using libwww), I finally 
got my binary uploads to work flawlessly using a LRWP.

Sorry about the confusion.

Regards,
Fabien.

Hello all

Our application area is document imaging including production environments.

With the growing trend towards offshore processing, we now are faced with customers
scanning on-site and then transferring files to an offshore server. The quantum of
data could be anywhere from 500 MB per day to a few GB. Some of the customers have
dedicated 'pipes' which have to be used. Typically there is a dedicated pipe to a
US HQ and then one or more dedicated pipes to offshore servers. This implies a
multi-step transfer. And to complicate things a little more, there can be time
slots for the use of the pipes for these transfers.

It seems like we could build this using the SMT architecture.

At the originating site, we have a FTP client - this could be built as an SMT
agent.  Happily the FTP RFC includes state diagrams and should make writing the
agent relatively easier.

At all other sites we have a Xitami webserver with the FTP agent running. If the
server is an 'intermediate' site, the server includes the FTP client agent as well.
Once a 'set' of files are recd by the server, a message is sent to the FTP client
agent to initiate the transfer to the next server. Each 'set' is a batch of images
with a control file - the onward sending starts only when the 'set' is complete -
this validation is specific to our context.

The FTP client configuration will include :

a. the alternate routes available for transfer - this would be in the intermediate
sites.
b. the number of simultaneous transfers that can be initiated
c. TCP/IP configuration to ensure max throughput - I have found some articles on
the TCP/IP configuration for these kind of large transfers

 Hi Kimman,

 I think HTTP would be a better protocol to use,
 if only for the benefit of using LRWP to receive data
 behind a standard xitami or an "HTTPS" xitamipro, and
 the functions available in SFL.

 This would allow you to prototype with a stand alone
 LRWP executable before going into a full SMT Agent/Application.

 Besides, the meta information that you could put in
 an HTTP header, would be useful for your routing
 algorithms on the receiving site.

 It would also allow the end users scanning the documents
 to easily send them via an HTML form.

 Regards

You really should look at some document specific compression 
methods then.

Take a look at http://www.lizardtech.com/ .

and 

http://www.djvuzone.org/ .

Using DjVu compression I can get a 43+Meg document down to under
10 Megs.  You can see these examples on 
http://www.unusualresearch.com/ .

Simple black and white page scans might be as low as 50K per 
page, from originals that are in the meg range.

There are specific compression methods for medical imaging and 
maps as well.

> At the originating site, we have a FTP client - 

You might be better served by a rsync or unison client.
rsync has much better error detection and recovery than FTP.

Any one done rsync in SMT?

> Imaging Solutions Pvt Ltd

Sounds like a fun project.  I'm always playing with my scanners 
here at home trying to reduce the weight of my library down to a 
few CD's.  Just wish I could afford faster scanners, and ones 
that didn't skew the paper during feeding all the time.

Ever come across any good deskewing code?

With the Xitami FTP server? Have you stress-tested it with the loads
you expect?

X's FTP is fine for lightweight duty and is free. My experience
though is that it can lock-up on a hundred files and a hundred megs.
Not every time, in fact maybe twice a year for a small system. But
you'll have more traffic, and bigger traffic, every day than I have
in a year. With remote servers all over the world, that means a lot
of driving to re-boot stuck machines, and a lot of error recovery to
find where the transfer stuck and try again.

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Mailing List Admin: DNS changes
Message-ID: <20020624132210.A79D1ADF71@basilica.la.naos.co.nz>

Hi Folks,

We (iMatix) are in the middle of moving some domains from one DNS server
to another DNS server.  One of the domains being moved is "xitami.org",
as used by lists.xitami.org for this mailing list.

It is possible that for a (hopefully) short period of time during this
move the domain xitami.org, and hence lists.xitami.org, may be
inaccessible, at least to some people.

To help ensure that the mailing list remains available during this
period, I have configured "lists.xitami.com" (note ".com", not ".org")
as a backup name for the mailing list, viz:

http://lists.xitami.com/mailman/listinfo/xitami-dev

xitami-dev@lists.xitami.com

If you have trouble with the main address (lists.xitami.org) this week 
please try the lists.xitami.com address instead.

we finished the update to the 2.3 api (without JSP) and need
beta testers for it.

it should run with java 1.1.8 also. any volunteers ? the beta
should run by simply exchanging the javax.jar and runner.jar

Yes, atleast I am watching your great work with
servlets with great interest even though I have not
used it yet.

Hopefully I will do it soon.
