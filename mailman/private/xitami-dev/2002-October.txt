Long ago I asked these questions and received these answers here on the list:

I know that CVS has been turned off.

I would like to procede with trying to write a spam filter with SFL/SMT.

The one that diverted me for all of these months was http://mailfilter.sf.net/ 
.  Which I still see as a very nice package.  However it has become so 
intangled in the GNU way of ./configure needed things like Flex, Bison, 
ad-infinitum to do a simple C++ compile, that it has literally become 
impossible for it to be built on some systems (like mine).

Getting 100+ spams per day is good motivation.  :-)

I know there are other spam filters out there, but none that I've found that 
will work on both Windows and Linux, with the same configuration file.   I 
know I can run code under Cygwin to solve the problem (like Mailfilter) but 
it is much slower than native code.

My question is can I get the newer POP3 / SMTP code now?

After 10 months has it made the top of the list yet?  The circular build 
problems are the reason I gave up on SFL/SMT for a while.  Now I wish I had 
stuck with my original plan for my spam filter.

Unlike a web server (Xitami), or biz. apps. (STEP), every one needs a spam 
filter these days.  Look at this project as good marketing for you and yours.  
:-)

This is the concept, taken largely from Mailfilter:

There is a single configuration file.

It contains the following sections:

1) Server info (Where do I get the mail from).
Encrypted passwords (not plan text), a frequent request on the Mailfilter 
list.

2) My address list.  If the message is not sent To/Cc: one of these addresses 
it is deleted as spam.  Mailfilter has such a feature but it is hard to set 
up.

3) List of addresses to allow mail from unconditionally (never delete it).

4) List of addresses/subjects/headers to deny mail from unconditionally 
(delete it).  #3 over rides #4.  To save time processing stops at the first 
matching rule.

5) Some day (in other words I don't know how right now), allow AND/OR/IF type 
logic to the rules.  Anyone here have any suggestions?

#6) As much as practical keep the configuration file compatible with 
mailfilter.

Assume all of the above are using Regular Expressions for matching, unless 
some one here has a better idea.

Only the headers are read on the server (POP3: TOP x 0), never the text of the 
message, for speed reasons.  You can not delete a message based on its 
message content.

Unlike the current version of Mailfilter this would be a two pass system, to 
gain speed.  Normal pass, typically run in a Cron job, identifies the spams, 
but does not delete them.  This keeps the message pointers from being 
renumbers, so that you don't have to do a complete rescan each time.  When 
you actually pick up the mail the messages are really deleted before 
importing them to your mail client (different command line option)

Subtitlies learned from experience:  
 Subjects needed to be normalized before trying to match.
   Subject: Viagra should be the same as these:
   Subject V I A G R A
   Subject V#$#I.A#G@R!A

 Very complex regular expressions break the standard GNU RE library randomly, 
and unpredictably (internal stack over flow?), so don't use it.
  
  RE matching seems like it would be right up the ally of SMT.  Is there such 
a SMT RE library? 

 If not use this RE library:  http://www.ddj.com/articles/2001/0110/

If there is a need for I18N issues, stay away from GetText (Mailfilters 
downfall because of all of the build issues), and use 
http://www-124.ibm.com/icu/ .

 Need to have option of case/or no case sensitivity in rule matching.

Examples:

  From: johndoe@x.com
  To:  MyAddress@here.com
  Subject: Buy your Viagra here.

 Message is deleted because subject Viagra is considered spam per #4 above.

  From: MyWife@home.com
  To:  MyAddress@here.com
  Subject: Bring home some Viagra tonight.

  Message is kept because it is from my wife, and I won't be spending time 
working on this spam filter code tonight.  :-) #3

  From: johndoe@x.com
  To:  IhaveNoClue@WhoThisIs.com
  Subject: Bring home some Viagra tonight.

 Message is deleted because it is not To/Cc: one of my addresses (#2), and not 
#3.

How do we get there?

We turned off the CVS because it was almost impossible to construct 
SFL/SMT from it.

In the meantime, we've continued to work on our tools and things are 
looking up.

I think the idea of a portable spam filter is a really good idea.  
But then I love the idea of portable software in general.  I have to 
say that we've been using SpamAssassin at iMatix, and it works 
exceedingly well.

We have packaged all our open source tools into RealiBase, which is 
our base package for realtime software (hence the name).  Xitami is 
separately packaged.

I've put the current build of RealiBase up on imatix.com, at:
   http://imatix.com/pub/rbase_1_0_src.zip for Windows
and 
   http://imatix.com/pub/rbase_1_0_src.tar.gz for Unix

We will start automating this update, and probably use Sourceforge 
for downloads.

To build from the source package you need Linux and gcc, or Windows 
2000 and MSVC.  If you want to use other compilers on Windows, you 
will need to add support into the c.bat file before building.

To build, unzip the source package and run the build.bat or build.sh 
script.  This builds and installs into the default installation path, 
which is c:\imatix on Windows and /usr/local/imatix on Unix.  In both 
cases make sure you have write access to these directories.  You can 
install into another location by setting the IBASE variable first.

e.g. to build and install into a user directory on Linux:

   export IBASE=~HOME/base
   sh ./build.sh

Next, what is in RealiBase?

 - SFL, SMT, Libero, Htmlpp
 - Gaggle, a group of miscellaneous tools
 - Zlib, PCRE, two packages we use in GSL
 - Gurudoc, our replacement for htmlpp, still in progress
 - GSL/3.0

Of which, the last is probably the most interesting.  This is the 
first release of GSL/3.0 to the world.

Now to your question about POP3/SMTP.  The SFL functions did not work 
very well in previous releases.  We've improved them considerably, 
but they remain single-threaded and thus not ideal for volume use.  
We have built SMTP and POP3 agents in SMT, which are more interesting.

But, the most interesting possibility of all is to use GSL.  We have 
integrated PCRE (the Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library) and 
GSL/3 now makes it easy to extend the language by adding extensions 
like this (we also added zipfile functions from zlib).

GSL can script SMT agents.  This means that you could probably use 
GSL to build the spam agent, at least to prototype it.  You can 
define your spam filter lists as XML files, of course.  You can even 
multithread GSL scripts, to - e.g. - clean-up multiple POP3 boxes in 
parallel.

http://www.digitalmars.com/ would be a good one to support.

One thing we obviously have a philosophical disagreement on is using the words 
'Realtime' and 'Windows' together.  :-)  My current project at work is a 
power control for a several hundred ton machine.  I'm dealing in micro 
seconds.  Now that is 'Realtime'.

BTW, http://htmlpp.org is dead, as that is one of the links I just looked at

I use Genpage old and crude by todays standard but I've not found any thing 
else that has the features that I need.  Mostly the glossary and template 
concept so I can build multiple sites with different look out of the same 
content files.

http://www.adebaumann.com/genpage/

Hopfully Gurudoc can incoperate some of those concepts.

I'll try to give it a shot when ever thing is available.

Bob,

I like the Organisation line in your emails, "Mostly via piles". That's
what you get for sitting in front of a computer too long, I guess.

Yes.  No-one seemed to like the name "OpenKernel".

Htmlpp.org was one more dotcom victim, but we've fixed it to point 
back to imatix.com for now.

Gurudoc does not have a glossary function but it turns simple text 
into different formats under control of cusomisable style templates, 
which is what we needed.  Our goal is to use this for all our 
documentation web sites.

Hello,

Is there any effort to make SFL thread safe? 

Maybe, I'll do it sometime if no one else :) because I just love SMT but it
cannot use the power of multi-processors which is the default way to
increase server capacity (eg. web or other service-like). And, as one of my
pal says, it "linearizes" the program which means it serves the requests in
order of arrival but with threads requests would see an "equally
distributed" ;) response delay instead of that related to actual queue
position... OR, you (the programmer) must unroll every for() into 
event_send(myself)..

Enough comments :) Actually, I pick up with QpThread C++ lib portable to win
and unix. It has safe queue support inside. So, I play with the thougths to
build an SMT like AGENT set primarily with net and timer support but all
thread being a real thread or can be a real thread, using safe queues. Oh
yeah, I know it is lots of work.. but sometimes it may pay.. :)


Further back, I made a Java SMT but without standard agents (I was no more
time). Somebody interested? It works with Java 1.2 or 1.3.0 as far as I
remember. I may provide it "as is" to anybody but it may require some review
before "official" use (actually I have no time to do this).

Regards,
Laszlo

The goal of the glossary is to contain all of the inter-page links and 
external URL's.  It works like a table of macros that get expanded.

For a real example I have two different servers that use different styles of 
page counters, but other wise the page is the same.

So at the end of the single content page these macros get expanded by looking 
up in the glossary file what needs to happen:

<%COUNTER_TEXT%>

<%COUNTER_URL%>

Maybe there is some similar concept in what you have under a different name.

The build process controls which glossary gets used.

Same concept applies to internal URL's, same page content may appear in a 
different place on a different server.  So when you go to move a page you 
only change the glossary.  You don't have to go mucking through all of the 
content files to make sure you didn't miss one when you moved it.

One way to do multi-server load balancing is at the DNS level.
Take a look at the links here: http://www.djbdns.org/

Not as much fun as your own SMT code... :-)

That came from seeing some one else's that said "Organization: Mediocre at 
best".

Actually I keep things very well organized in the filing cabinets.  With 
AT&T's DjVu technology I've been getting more of it scanned for faster look 
up.

If any one here does lots of rendering of page scans you need DjVu.

As soon as you use multiple processes, you can benefit from multiple 
processors and less FIFO behaviour.  This is the idea behind WTP, the 
web transaction protocol included in Studio (now part of Xitami).  
We've never found the FIFO behaviour of SMT to be problematic since 
heavy work (in our business, anyhow) inevitably consists of database 
access, and this inevitably requires external processes managed by 
something like WTP.

What did you have in mind when you made this?  We built SMT mainly to 
allow us to develop fast servers, and C was the obvious choice for 
this.  But sometimes I regret not having used C++, since it would 
have allowed us to make the SMT abstraction much cleaner.

Sure. I'm a SMT lover and I use it where possible so in my work too.
Unfortunately ;) my workpals don't want to change their mind and coding
scheme. Biggest difficulty for them to keep in mind to unroll the long loops
(I understand that this is uncomfortable) and to establish inter-process
data exchange to execute a simple sql query while it is really simple in eg.
Windows C++. This is mostly the problem. OTOH, inter-process communication
in a server means more fd (in case of a portable solution) for the entry
process. LB dns could be a solution but then it is not enough to buy procs
but at least net cards and IP addresses too. Never mind, just thoughts.

Nothing special ;) It was a try at the company to build multi platform
solutions in Java on Call Center or CRM fields with some inspiration from
another Java based solution. Then, I mentioned this SMT strategy. That's
all. We are now on M$ with C++ because of the small-medium target sector and
promotion opportunities...

.. And yes, I made this part of the development on C++ class and native win
thread base with Libero code generation. Because of the above reasons, no
SFL and SMT used. This is actually a framework and others code applications
with further tools for web forms and DB handling.

I would be very happy to tell more about this framework and improvments but
you know.. it's not only my business.. :(

PS: I believe this FSM approach must become an industry standard to develop
trustable, stable software. Object oriented solutions are good in design but
lock and race conditions can mess them up. However, FSM is still a kind of
object but always know where it is and what should come next. /Me/ ;)

Me and my colleagues have been using Libero and similar tools for 
about 15 years and two big themes emerge:

1. Software built around human-readable FSMs is always significantly 
easier to maintain, modify, and understand than either OO or 
procedural code, written by the same people.  This is because FSMs 
are excellent at abstracting and eliminating complexity from a design.

2. Most people *hate* learning the methodology.  This is because 
people often hate making the effort of abstracting and eliminating 
complexity.  :)

So, I believe that the approach will remain in a niche for the last 
reason.  But we're very happy with SMT - it forms the basis for much 
of the custom work we do for customers.  And so, we will continue to 
develop and support it.

Hi All

I am reading a book called Design Patterns in
Communications Software. And guess what they say about
developing real time , ultra reliable, communications
software.

1) Do not use processes
2) Run to completion 
3) Fresh work before stale (LIFO) [ I am sure that can
be easily done in SMT]

I have not read the whole book but I am sure that I
will discover more Patterns that are already used in
SMT.

What I think is needed for SMT to become popular is a
good book. I have read Jim Coplien's book on Advanced
C++, where I knew that what he was saying made sense
but it was really difficult to use. Then came the
Design Patterns book by GoF, and things were much
clearer and finally understood the concepts that Mr.
Coplien was trying to express. Similarly what SMT
needs is a good book with simple examples at the start
and finally ending in Basic Introduction to Xitami
where it all ties together. Chapters on adapting SMT
to Windows Messaging Model with sample code and Simple
Database access through SMT is a must.

Easy to use Object Oriented Interface would be great.
[ I am sure that if Pieter would guide us in
converting the SMT code into C++ iteratively, we would
all volunteer for the effort]

Just my opinion
